  <p class="asangre">I went to Missouri, and learned the truth. And from her, I met Fletcher Gable, who gave me this book and said: "Write everything down." That’s what Fletcher told me, like this new life is a school and I’ll flunk out if I don’t have good notes. Only if I flunk out of this school, I’ll be dead. And the boys will be orphans. So I’m going to go back to where this started.</p>

  <p>Two weeks ago my wife was murdered. I watched her die, pinned to the ceiling of Sammy’s room, blood dripping onto his cradle until she burst into flames —looking at me as she died. The week before that, we were a normal family… eating dinner, going to Dean’s T-ball game, buying toys for baby Sammy. But in a instant, it all changed… When I try to think back, get it straight in my head… I feel like I’m going crazy. Like someone ripped both my arms off, plucked my eyes out… I’m wandering around, alone and lost, and I can’t do anything.</p>

  <p>Mary used to write books like this one. She said it helped her remember all the little things, about the boys, me… I wish I could read her journals, but like everything else, they’re gone. Burned into nothing. She always wanted me to try writing things down. Maybe she was right, maybe it will help me to remember, to understand. Fletcher seems to think so.</p>

  <p>Nothing makes sense anymore… My wife is gone, my sons are without their mother… the things I saw that night, I remember hearing Mary scream, and I ran, but then… everything was clam, just for a second —Sammy was fine— and I was sure I had been hearing things —too many horror movies too late at night. But then there was the blood, and when I looked up, my wife…</p>

  <p>Half our house is gone, even though the fire burned for only a few hours. Most of our clothes and photos are ruined, even our safe —the safe with Mary’s old diaries, the passbooks for the boy’s college accounts, what little jewelry we had… all gone. How could my house, my whole life, go up like that, so fast, so hot? How could my wife just burn up and disappear?</p>

  <p>I want my wife back. Oh God, I want her back.</p>

  <p>I thought at first that we would stay. Mike and Kate helped me take care of the boys at first, and Julie’s been great too, but I tried to tell them —tell Mike— what I think happened that night. He just looked at me, this look… like he’s sure I’m crazy. He must have told Kate something too. Out of nowhere she said the next morning, I should think about seeing a shrink. How can I talk to a stranger about this? I never saw shrink for everything I went through in the Marines, and I got through that. My friends think I’m going insane. Who knows, maybe I am…</p>

  <p>The police quit on the case as soon as they couldn’t pin it on me. They don’t care that she was on the ceiling, they don’t care about the blood on her stomach or about any of the things I’ve seen since then. They want a tidy answer. Doesn’t matter to them whether it’s the right one. The last time I talked to them, a week after she died, they asked me the same questions they asked me the night of the fire. Where was I? How was my relationship with Mary in the weeks prior to the fire? Any problems with the boys? I can tell where they’re going.</p>

  <p>Mary’s uncle Jacob had a funeral for her in Illinois, where she was from. I didn’t go. Why? There was nothing to bury, and I don’t think I could have listened to what anyone there would have said. I’ve been drinking too much, trailing off in the middle of sentences. I hear things at night while I sit in Sam and Dean’s room. Everything lately feels like those instances when you remember a dream a few days after you had it, but then you can’t remember if it was a dream or if it actually happened. I keep going over that night in my head… why did I ever get out of bed? I left my wife by herself to go watch TV, and she died. I’m so sorry, Mary.</p>

  <p>Dean still hardly talks. I try to make small talk, or ask him if he wants to throw the baseball around. Anything to make him feel like a normal kid again. He never budges from my side —or from his brother. Every morning when I wake up, Dean is inside the crib, arms wrapped around baby Sam. Like he’s trying to protect him from whatever is out there in the night.</p>

  <p>Sammy cries a lot, wanting his mom. I don’t know how to stop it, and part of me doesn’t want to. It breaks my heart to think that soon he won’t remember her at all. I can’t let her memory die.</p>

  <p>Woke up yesterday morning with a nasty hangover… Wasn’t in the mood to do much of anything, much less have a heart-to-heart with Mike, who jumped on me the second I walked into the kitchen. I guess that’s his right, since it was his house. He was going on about how I have to get myself together, for the boys… but he seemed more concerned about the garage than anything else. Accusing me of phoning it in, you’ve barely been in to work… No kidding I’ve barely been in to work… My wife is dead, something horrible happened to her, maybe my boys are at risk too… how can I forget about all that and go to work, for God’s sake?</p>

  <p>Anyway, I told him he could have it. That stopped him cold. "You’re telling me that you’re gonna give up your life’s work over this?" Watch me, Mike. It’s yours.</p>

  <p>I walked out of the house with Mike’s check in my hand. He wasn’t so worried about me that he wouldn’t let me go. Do I blame him? I don’t know, I took the boys back to Julie’s and went to the first check-cashing place I could find. Walked out with enough cash to fill the back of the car with security. Two 12-gauges —Winchester 1300 pump and Stevens 311 side-by-side, Spread of sidearms— good old Browning 9 mm, .44 Desert Eagle, snub Ruger SP101, and a little pocket .22. That’ll do for a start.</p>

  <p>Haven’t ever written anything this long in my life. Hope I never do again.</p>

  <p>Went to see Missouri for the second time, and I can’t explain it… it was like we’d been friends for years. She knew every detail, not just of my life, but also of me… my thoughts… fears. She was the first person who didn’t look at me like I was crazy wen I told her my story… she just listened and nodded, and then she told me she believed me.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img001.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>She also said that if I wanted answers, I’d need to make a sacrifice. A blood sacrifice. So I pulled out one of my own fingernails, like I did that every day. She had a vision, and we found a bloody mess in a neighbor’s house along with the words <span class="versalita">WE’RE COMING FOR THE CHILDREN</span> written in blood. I don’t remember anything between that and finding Sam and Dean safe back at Julie’s, thank God, but Julie… Julie was dead. Something just tore her apart. Missouri found a tooth in her body, I tried to draw it but I can’t draw. I took the boys, said good-bye to Missouri, and got the hell out of Lawrence. If I never go back, it’ll be too soon.</p>

  <p>Not for Dean, though. The first thing he wanted to know was when we would go home. But we don’t have a home anymore, Dean. The sooner you get used to that, the better. We don’t have a home until we find what killed your mother.</p>

  <p>First stop, Eureka. Fletcher said we should start there.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 19"><span id="november-19">November 19:</span><a href="#november-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">I’m going to try to write this down just as it happened, no matter how unbelievable. Because if I can’t believe it myself —if I can’t rationally write down what I saw— how is anyone else ever going to believe it?</p>

  <p>Jacob showed up looking for the boys. I talked him into coming with me to a cemetery where I thought there might be some answers, and I got him killed. The hellhound —that’s what Fletcher calls it— came out of a crypt and it tore holes in him like I haven’t seen in a human being since Vietnam. Then H was there, I don’t know who he is, but he saved my life like I couldn’t save Jacob’s. But he wouldn’t let me take Jacob to a hospital. He said Jacob was dying, and that whatever we were looking for, it was keeping him alive to prolong his suffering. I didn’t want to believe him, but he’d been right about what happened up until then… There was nothing we could do, H said, and God help me I went along with him, and I stood there and watched while my car rolled into a quarry with Jacob dying inside.</p>

  <p>And all H said was, "Guess you got a new car." That cold-blooded bastard. I may learn from him, but I’ll never like him, and I’ll never trust him. He started talking about demons, Hellhounds, demons…</p>

  <p>I let Jacob die. Could I have saved him? Maybe not, maybe H was right. But I didn’t even try. What am I becoming? I always tried to conduct myself so that if the boys asked me why I did something, I wouldn’t have to lie to them. But what am I going to say if they ever ask me about their uncle Jake?</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 20"><span id="november-20">November 20:</span><a href="#november-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">I killed a man in cold blood tonight.</p>

  <p>No, I killed a shapeshifting monster tonight to protect all of the people who don’t know things like that exist. But it would have looked like a man to any of those people. And Dean saw it happen.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img002.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>It looked like Ichi, a hunter H took me out with. We were looking for a heeler, a kind of… something. Not a man. It attacks, kills, then springs away before anyone can react. Springheel Jack, Jack the Ripper, was a heeler, according to H. But H is the same guy who had me roll Jacob into a quarry, still alive. He was going to die. I know he was going to die. But he was still alive.</p>

  <p>And then tonight, Dean walked out of the roadhouse right when I put the final bullet into the shapeshifter’s head. And he said, "Why’d you kill him, Dad?"</p>

  <p>How am I supposed to answer that? Because he wasn’t a man, he was a monster who looked like a man? My boy walked out the door and saw me shoot someone in the head. Maybe I’m the monster who looks like a man.</p>

  <p>Back up. Write everything down.</p>

  <p>H said he was going to start showing me the ropes. There are people who hunt monsters. They have a kind of network, moving through places like Bill and Ellen’s roadhouse. Bill is a hunter, and they have a little girl, Jo. She’s not much older than Sammy. The hunters swap stories about what they’ve seen. They’re all damaged, broken. They hate the things they hunt. I’m just like them.</p>

  <p>Ellen’s niece watched the boys while H took me and Ichi out looking for this shapeshifter. Mary, you know I would never leave the boys with strangers I couldn’t trust. You know that, right? I never would.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit"><span id="november-21">November 21</span><a href="#november-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">The boys are with Pam and Bill in Elgin. I haven’t spent a whole night away from them since Mary died, and I can feel it like a hook in my gut, wanting to get back to them, protect them. But H says I need to talk to Mary again, and if he can make that happen…</p>

  <p>He goes on about demons. A demon killed his wife, he says, and just expects me to believe it. But what he looks like to me is someone who let grief turn him into a monster. Whatever happened to his wife, it doesn’t excuse what he’s done. And I can’t let myself turn into him. I’m not a hunter. I’m a husband and father who wants revenge for his wife.</p>

  <p>Here’s what I wish I could say to Dean —Your brother’s too young to understand any of this, but you’re beginning to. And that scares me. Since your mother died, I’ve seen unspeakable things, and now you’ve seen them and that’s my fault. I feel the darkness of the road I’m traveling on now. It’s not a place for you. One day you’ll see— I had to leave you today… but when I’m done, I promise you; the day will come when I never have to leave you again. Until then, I can only pray that you’re strong enough to look after Sam. One of us has to be.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 24"><span id="november-24">November 24:</span><a href="#november-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">We’re on the way to somewhere, H and me, but I’m the rookie and I don’t get to ask where. He says he’s taking me to meet someone who’s going to let me talk to Mary, but before that we need to do a couple of things.</p>

  <p>A hunter never passes up a hunt.</p>

  <p>Never.</p>

  <p>This is what H says. So tonight we took on a strange kind of undead thing. H said it was a revenant, maybe? I don’t know what that is. Yet. I’ll find out.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img003.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>People called it Doc Benton. He wanted to live forever, and when he couldn’t make alchemy work, he turned to organ theft instead. He kept himself alive by replacing each of his organs, as they failed one at a time, with organs harvested from unlucky locals. According to H, this has been going on since 1816. The doc was trouble, until I took him apart with a chainsaw after H burned the corpse of his most recent victim. Lesson: burning the victim weakened the doc by depriving him of the power he’d gotten from those organs. According to H, you can solve a lot of problems with gasoline and a match.</p>

  <p>I need to learn more about revenants. I need to learn more about everything.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 25"><span id="november-25">November 25:</span><a href="#november-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Today, in a town called Blue Earth, Minnesota, I met a crazy priest who brought Mary to me. His name is Jim, but what he did wasn’t like any church ritual I’ve ever seen, and I doubt he learned it in a seminary. He cut himself, and his blood turned into fire, but it didn’t burn him. And then the fire turned into Mary.</p>

  <p>Mary.</p>

  <p>She said my name. I think she said some other tings too, but hearing her voice say my name again… I can’t describe what that was like. But it only lasted a few seconds and then she turned into a… I don’t know. Like the Black Shuck, a devil dog. A hellhound. It spoke to me, and said, "Soon you will come to me."</p>

  <p>After it was gone, Jim looked at the hellhound’s tooth. There are numbers on it: 1127. Mary died at 11:27, according to the police report. H and Jim agreed that the number were some kind of coordinate carved into the tooth, but what does it mean?</p>

  <p>Written in blood: In olden times in the West people used to say "I put my hand and seal" on a document when signing it. In the East this was literal in some cases. The emperor of Japan in ancient days "signed" important documents by dipping his hand in blood and putting a full bloody handprint on the page. In the history of pacts with the Devil, people were supposed to sign their names in blood. I have seen a couple of alleged pacts from earlier centuries and neither, as far as I can tell, was signed in blood, though they do bear signatures of people. Blood undoubtedly stressed the seriousness of the signing. You were giving away your soul. "The Blood Is the Life."</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 27"><span id="november-27">November 27:</span><a href="#november-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">1,700 miles in 24 hours flat, me and H handing the wheel back and forth, from Blue Earth to Tempe. Fletcher Gable. He showed us a map of cemeteries —Devil’s Gate, he called them. Places where demons can get through our world. I don’t know about demons, but the map was divided into sectors, and cemetery #112 in Zone 7 was in Hope, Colorado, near the Four Corners.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img004.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>I don’t know how to explain what happened there. The Fore Inn, set on the edge of a town full of dead bodies, hallucinations… we found the inn, and there was the hellhound, the Black Shuck, and it came to H like a spaniel. He said he didn’t kill Mary, but he set the dog on me, and said he knew "some of the players involved." But they weren’t demons, he said. I killed the dog, and then H changed his whole tack. Said that everything he’d done, even siccing the dog on me, was a way to get me to hunt. He said he wasn’t H, he was something else in a hunter’s body. A man’s body. All I could thing of was shooting the shape-shifter outside the roadhouse with Dean as a witness. I killed H, and I burned the hotel. I’m writing this at a rest stop on I-76 outside Julesburg. I killed H, and I’ll goddamn well hunt, all right, I’ll hunt, and the boys will hunt, an we will find whatever killed Mary and we will send it to Hell. And on the way, we will kill every monster and ghoul and ghost and demon and anything else. My boys will not grow up to experience what I have. They will not lose what I have lost.</p>

  <p class="cursiva cita asangre">This black dog, or the divel in such a likenesse (God hee knoweth al who worketh all,) running all along down the body of the church with great swiftnesse, and incredible haste, among the people, in a visible fourm and shape, passed between two persons, as they were kneeling uppon their knees, and occupied in prayer as it seemed, wrung the necks of them bothe at one instant clene backward, in somuch that even at a moment where they kneeled, they strangely dyed.</p>

  <p class="asangre">We’re gone from Elgin. Where to, I don’t know. Wherever I can learn what happened to Mary, and kill whoever didi it. The hunters are out there. One of them must know something about what happened to her. I’ll head back to roadhouse first. Bill and Ellen will let us stay for a while. After that, who knows?</p>

  <p>Never been much for books, but then I never was much for keeping a journal, either. Things have changed. I started looking for old books like Fletcher has, like I saw some of the hunters reading at the roadhouse. I need to learn. Know your enemy. And I started digging around libraries. I’m collecting old police files, going through microfiche… looking for any fires, arsons, with similar MOs to our fire. I’m gonna find this thing that killed my wife, and when I do… God forgive me…</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="December 11"><span id="december-11">December 11:</span><a href="#december-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy has finally started sleeping through the night, and now that Dean shares a bed with him, he’s out like a light too. But me… I close my eyes and she’s there. It always starts the same, I’m seeing her as she was before that night, beautiful and happy and alive. And I’m not seeing it, I’m living it, it’s like I’m there… it’s so real, I know I can reach out and touch her. And so I do… I reach out… and suddenly I’m back to that night, to the blood and the fire and Mary, Mary is on the ceiling, and how did she get on the ceiling… she can’t be on the ceiling…</p>

  <p>Here’s the weird part. When I wake up, sweating and panting… I swear there is something there. I can feel it, hovering over me, over my boys. It’s watching, it’s watching, I think it’s even mocking me… You couldn’t stop this. You couldn’t keep her safe. You can’t keep them safe.</p>

  <p class="asangre">I actually fell asleep last night… then woke up in a cold sweat five minutes later. Feeling that presence again… and thinking. I’ve been reading about fires, how they start, how quickly they spread… but one of the books talked about strange fires, fires with no explanations… it said that some people believe fire can be controlled by certain evil entities, beings, and used to harm people. It’s crazy, the stuff of fairy tales… when I went back to Sammy’s room that night, when I tried to get to Mary… the fire leaped out. Leaped out at me… like it had a purpose, like it wanted to keep me away, to stop me from reaching her. Like someone was controlling it.</p>

  <p class="asangre">I’m beginning to understand that there’s nobody else but me. Other hunters have seen things. A guy named Frank Gutierrez told me with a straight face that Route 666 is thick with devil dogs. But every hunter’s got a different story, and none of them have seen exactly what I’ve seen. If I want answers, I’m going to have to find them myself. Been reading about black dogs. Black Shuck. Old English <em>scucca</em> = demon. Also known as barghest, as a death omen.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img008.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Black dogs haunt roads. Sometimes they have a headless woman with them, or are headless. To see them means you will have a death in the family. Most of the written stories are British, but I’ve been asking around a little. Everybody’s got a black dog story: in Macon County, Tennessee; Meriden, Connecticut; Long Island, Oregon.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Didn’t sleep again last night. Woke up in a cold sweat and realized it was Christmas. Where’s Mary? That was my thought all night, and it stayed in my mind all day. Christmas without my wife seems unreal. Our celebration was clumsy… a crooked two-foot-tall plastic tree, a bunch of junk food stuffed in the stockings, and a pile of sports equipment for the boys… football, basketball, soccer ball. My attempt to bring back some normalcy. Already Dean is too big for T-ball, this year we’ll be going to real Little League games. Or rather, I’ll be going to the games. Alone.</p>

  <p>Mary will never see Dean hit a home run. She’ll never see Sammy walk, or hear him say his first words. She won’t take Dean to his first day at school, or stay up all night with me worrying the first night he takes the car out. It’s not right that she’s not here, and that’s all I could think about today. I’m so angry I can barely see straight —I want my wife back.</p>

  <p>The police have officially declared our case closed. What a Christmas present, huh?</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="December 29"><span id="december-29">December 29:</span><a href="#december-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Back at the roadhouse. We’re going to stay here for a while. I can’t just drive around in circles. The boys need a place they can think of as home, even if it doesn’t last. And I need a place where I can learn what hunters do. The only holiday spirit I have is bloodlust. I want to kill. The last time I remember feeling like this was Vietnam. But I think we can stay here for a while to get our feet on the ground. Or I can get my feet on the ground, anyway; I don’t know what it will take for the boys to feel normal again. Dean hasn’t been the same since he saw me kill that shape-shifter. I don’t know how to talk to him about it. He’s no even five years old. Most kids his age don’t even have a clear idea what death is, and he’s seen it up close and personal. What do I say to him? How old does he have to be before I tell him the truth?</p>

  <p class="asangre">Today a new year begins. Mary loved this time of the year; she loved the idea of a fresh start for everyone. She always made a resolution, once a year, and unlike most people, she kept hers. And every year she tried to talk me into making one, but I could never see the point. I wish I could have seen her diary. Maybe it would help me remember her. Maybe it would clue me in to some of her secrets. Maybe that’s the point of a diary. Keep your stories, your life, from dying. So that other people don’t forget.</p>

  <p>God I wish the boys could have known Mary longer.</p>

  <p>This year I’m finally making a resolution. I’m going to find out what happened to my wife.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="January 24"><span id="january-24">January 24:</span><a href="#january-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Dean turns five today. I was thinking about where we’re going to be in the fall, because he should start school. Then I realized that I can’t leave him at school. Anything could happen. Maybe a place that has half-day kindergarten. Maybe that I could do. I know I should. I know he should be able to run around with other kids, who don’t know how to field-strip the Browning. Well, Dean doesn’t either, yet. But he’s learning. He’s got a talent for guns. I can see it already. And he’ll need it.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is a year old. We spent his birthday in the mountains because I had to meet a guy named Daniel Elkins. The hunter culture is weird about how it breaks in new blood. Everyone you meet says you should go meet someone else, and learn something else, and everytime you meet someone else they take you out to hunt their favorite kind of monster. This guy Elkins lives in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere in Colorado, and according to him, he’s the greatest vampire hunter alive.</p>

  <p>Vampires.</p>

  <p>They’re real. I’ve never seen one, but Daniel says they’re real, and I believe him. He also says that the hunter’s journal is for research as much as for recording day-to-day whatever. So I copied this from a book called the <em>Harleian Miscellany</em>:</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">We must not omit Observing here, that our Landlord seems to pay some regard to what Baron Valvasor has related of the Vampyres, said to infest some Parts of this Country. These Vampyres are supposed to be the Bodies of deceased Persons, animated by evil Spirits, which come out of the Graves, in the Night-time, suck the Blood of many of the Living, and thereby destroy them.</p>

  <p>Vampires, four hundreds years ago. There are other records, even older. Peter Plogojewitz, the Shoemaker of Silesia…</p>

  <p class="asangre">This would have been our sixth anniversary. Six is iron. Sammy took his first steps yesterday. He walked toward Dean, then fell flat on his face and started crying. Life is tough, kid. Do I sound like a proud dad? I am.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Mary has been dead for a year. I’m never going to be over it, and I wouldn’t want to be. But I’ve spent the last year getting better at revenge.</p>

  <p>Maby this is a good time to write down everything I’ve learned about Lawrence.</p>

      <li>Corner of 8th and Massachusetts: Ghost, woman in nineteenth-century dress.</li>

      <li>7th and Massachusetts: Eldridge Hotel. Word is the city’s going to rebuild it, so maybe the haunting will change —but Missouri says there’s something about the fifth floor. She gets visions more easily there, like the spirit world is closer somehow.</li>

      <li>Stull Church: abandoned since 1922. No roof, but you can stand inside it in a thunderstorm and not get wet. Rain will not fall on it. A crucifix still hangs on the wall, and it turns upside down when you approach.</li>

      <li>Stull Cemetery: Devil said to appear there twice a year, on the vernal equinox and Halloween. He is visiting the grave of one of his children, born of a human witch and dead after a few days.</li>

      <li>Haskell Institute: children’s cemetery near Taminend Hall, full of uneasy ghosts. Another ghost, a coed suicide, haunts the basement of Pocahontas Hall. Hiawatha Hall full of bad echoes, the sorrow and pain of generations of abused children. How many of them died?</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p>I’m learning about hauntings. Everyone I’ve talked to and read thinks they know evertything about hauntings, but they all say something different. Or so vague that it doesn’t mean anything. I read this and that, and tell myself that if I keep doing it, I’ll start to see the patterns.</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">In the world of spirits is always a very great number of them, as being the first sort of all, in order to their examintion and preparation; but there is no fixed time for their stay; for some are translated to heaven and others confined to hell soon after their arrival; whilst some continue there for weeks, and others for several years… Ebenezer Sibly</p>

  <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img010.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>This reminded me of Doc Benton. From William of Newburgh:</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">As soon as this man was left alone in this place, the devil, imagining that he had found the right moment for breaking his courage, incontinently roused up his own chosen vessel, who appeared to have reposed longer than usual. Having beheld this from afar, he grew stiff with terror by reason of his being alone; but soon recovering his courage, and no place of refuge being at hand, he valiantly withstood the onset of the fiend, who came rushing upon him with a terrible noise, and he struck the axe which he wielded in his hand deep into his body. On receiving this wound, the monster groaned aloud, an turning his back, fled with a rapidity not at all inferior to that which he had advanced, while the admirable man urged his flying foe from behind, and compelled him to seek his own tomb again; which opening of its own accord, and receiving its guest from the advance of the pursuer, immediately appeared to close again with the same facility. In the meantime, they who, impatient of the coldness of the night, had retreated to the fire ran up, though somewhat too late, and, having heard what had happened, rendered needful assistance in digging up and removing from the midst of the tomb the accursed corpse at the earliest dawn. When they had divested it of the clay cast forth with it, they found the huge wound it had received, and a great quantity of gore which had flowed from it in the sepulchre; and so having carried it away beyond the walls of the monastery and burnt it, they scattered the ashes to the winds.</p>

  <p>Everyone agrees that you have to burn them to make sure they stay dead. Should have burned Doc Benton, too, but I’m guessing the chainsaw did the trick.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Dean’s sixth birthday. It’s been more than a year since he saw me kill a shape-shifter. He doesn’t ask about it anymore. And he stopped asking when he’s going to go to school. I tried to do it last fall, but I couldn’t. I just couldn’t risk it. Maybe this year, now that he’s a little older, now that he knows a little more about things. I’ve been teaching him. Not the worst stuff, but enough so he knows that there are things that go bump in the night.</p>

  <p class="asangre salto10 mano">Myling. Scandinavian child spirit, also called utburd. Typically the souls of murdered children, or children who died unbaptized. They will ride travelers at night and demand to be taken to a graveyard so they can rest, buy they get heavier and heavier as the graveyard gets closer, until the person carrying them is driven under the earth by their weight. This belief is derived from the practice of leaving unwanted or deformed infants to die of exposure. Generally they haunt the location where they were abandoned, but folklore also notes their presence in the dwellings of those who killed them —usually a family member. If their remains can be located and buried in hallowed ground, they will disappear.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is two today. Two years in a row we’ve spent his birthday in Colorado, where I had to stop by Daniel’s. Still never seen a vampire, but Elkins is such a hermit that because I talk to him, other hunters are starting to ask me to pick his brain for them.</p>

  <p>Crosses won’t repel them, and sunlight won’t kill them. They can go outside. They need blood to survive, and prefer human blood, but can survive on other mammals if there are no humans around. The only way t be sure of killing them is beheading —although the blood of a dead man is like poison to them. I won’t kill them, but it weakens them, makes them slow and sick.</p>

  <p>Daniel says they’re extinct, but he keeps an eye out anyway, and he thinks I should know enough about them to take one on if there are any left. He gave me a copy of this article, in <span class="subrayado">case it was ever useful</span>.</p>

    <p class="asangre">There lived at Baghdad an aged merchant who had grown wealthy in his business, and who had an only son to whom he was tenderly attached. He resolved to marry him to the daughter of another merchant, a girl of considerable fortune, but without any personal attractions. Abul-Hassan, the merchant’s son, on being shown the portrait of the lady, requested his father to delay the marriage till he could reconcile his mind to it. Instead, however, of doing this, he fell in love with another girl, the daughter of a sage, and he gave his father no peace till he consented to the marriage with the object of his affections. The old man stood out as long as he could, bud finding that his son was bent on acquiring the hand of the fair Nadilla, and was equally resolute not to accept the rich and ugly lady, he did what most fathers, under such circumstances, are constrained to do, he acquiesced.</p>

    <p>The wedding took place with great pomp and ceremony, and a happy honeymoon ensued, which might have been happier but for one little circumstance which led to very serious consequences.</p>

    <p>Abul-Hassan noticed that his bride quitted the nuptial couch as soon as she thought her husband was asleep, and did nor return to it, till an hour before dawn.</p>

    <p>Filled with curiosity, Hassan one night feigned sleep, and saw his wife rise and leave the room as usual. He followed cautiously, and saw her enter a cemetery. By the straggling moonbeams he beheld her go into a tomb; he stepped in after her.</p>

    <p>The scene within was horrible. A party of ghouls were assembled with the spoils of the graves they had violated, and were feasting on the flesh of the long-buried corpses. His own wife, who, by the way, never touched supper at home, played no inconsiderable part in the hideous banquet.</p>

    <p>As soon as he could safely escape, Abul-Hassan stole back to his bed.</p>

    <p>He said nothing to his bride till next evening when supper was laid and she declined to eat; then he insisted on her partaking, and when she positively refused, he exclaimed, wrathfully, “Yes, you keep your apetite for your feast with the ghouls!” Nadilla was silent; she turned pale and trembled, and without a word sought her bed. At midnight she rose, fell on her husband with her nails and teeth, tore his throat, and having opened a vein, attempted to suck his blood; but Abdul-Hassan springing to his feet threw her down, and with a blow killed her. She was buried the next day.</p>

    <p>Three days after, at midnight, she reappeared, attacked her husband again, and again attempted to suck his blood. He fled from her, and on the morrow opened her tomb, burned her to ashes, and cast them into the Tigris.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Today was Dean’s first day of school. I put him straight into first grade. He’s almost seven, and I just told the school that he’d been in kindergarten back in Kansas. They didn’t press too hard when I told them that the kids had lost their mother, and we’d been moving around. I think we’ll stay here for a while. Or try, anyway. I felt normal again while I was taking Dean to school. He asked on the way in whether kids in school learned the same stuff he’d been learning. I had to tell him that maybe it wasn’t a good idea for him to talk about Dad’s job on the playground.</p>

  <p>He came home on the top of the world, and he brought me worksheets with the names of different parts of a fish, different numbers of apples and oranges added together… this is what it should be like. Why can’t it?</p>

  <p>Sammy wants to be in school too. I can’t even imagine staying in one place for long enough that he’ll start here. Three years seems like forever.</p>

Already, these are starting to seem like an everyday chore to me. You get the story, you find the remains, you burn them and salt them. End of story. These were two girls, and the whole ride back to the roadhouse I was thinking that I’ll never have girls. Dean saw something on my face, or maybe it was just that he knew what day it is. When I got here, he came up to me and asked if I’d had a tough hunt. I couldn’t talk for a minute.</p>

My drill sergeant would have taken him over me in a second. Times like this, I sure am proud of my boy. I have a feeling it’ll be different with Sammy. Maybe he’s just too young to show it, but I don’t think he’s got the same kind of killer instinct.</p>

  <div class="cita cursiva">
    <p class="asangre">Pliny the Younger, letter to Sura:</p>

    <p>There was at Athens a large and roomy house, which had a bad name, so that no one could live there. In the dead of the night a noise, resembling the clashing of iron, was frequently heard, which, if you listened more attentively, sounded like the rattling of chains, distant at first, but approaching nearer by degrees: immediately afterward a spectre appeared in the form of an old man, of extremely emaciated and squalid appearance, with a long beard and dishevelled hair, rattling the chains on his feet and hands. The distressed occupants meanwhile passed their wakeful nights under the most dreadful terrors imaginable. This, as it broke their rest, ruined their health, and brought on distempers, their terror grew upon them, and death ensued. Even in the daytime, though the spirit did not appear, yet the impression remained so strong upon their imaginations that it still seemed before their eyes, and kept them in perpetual alarm. Consequently the house was at length deserted, as being deemed absolutely uninhabitable; so that it was now entirely abandoned to the ghost. However, in hopes that some tenant might be found who was ignorant of this very alarming circumstance, a bill was put up, giving notice that it was either to be let or sold. It happened that Athenodorus the philosopher came to Athens at this time, and, reading the bill, enquired the price. The extraordinary cheapness raised his suspicion; nevertheless, when he heard the whole story, he was so far from being discouraged that he was more strongly inclined to hire it, and, in short, actually did so. When it grew toward evening, he ordered a couch to be prepared for him in the front part of the house, and, after calling for a light, together with his pencil and tablets, directed all his people to retire. But that his mind might not, for want of employment, be open to the vain terrors of imaginary noises and spirits, he applied himself to writing with the utmost attention. The first part of the night passed in entire silence, as usual; at length a clanking of iron an rattling of chains was heard: however, he neither lifted up his eyes nor laid down his pen, but in order to keep calm and collected, tried to pass the sounds off to himself as something else. The noise increased and advanced nearer, till it seemed at the door, and at last in the chamber. He looked up, saw, and recognized the ghost exactly as it had been described to him: it stood before him, beckoning with a finger, like a person who calls another. Athenodorus in reply made a sign with his hand that it should wait a little, and threw his eyes again upon his papers; the ghost then rattled its chains over the head of the philosopher, who looked upon this, and seeing it beckoning as before, immediately arose, and, light in hand, followed it. The ghost slowly stalked along, as if encumbered with its chains, and, turning into the area of the house, suddenly vanished. Athenodorus, being thus deserted, made a mark with some grass and leaves on the spot where the spirit left him. The next day he gave information to the magistrates, and advised them to order that spot to be dug up. This was accordingly done, and the skeleton of a man in chains was found there; for the body, having lain a considerable time in the ground, was putrefied and moldered away from the fetters. The bones being collected together were publicly buried, and thus after the ghost was appeased by the proper ceremonies, the house was haunted no more.</p>

  <p>It’s a slot canyon, used to flood all the time (Arroyo Seco isn’t always <em>seco</em>) until they put in a spillway and built the reservoir. But odd things happened there. Four kids in three years, from 1957-1960, vanish without a trace. Other people see things. No one will talk about it. Bill was sure that something had come up through the canyon thirty years ago, and was about to again. Some kind of hellspawn. So we went there to catch it in the act and take care of it. Hellspawn, that’s the word he used. I don’t know if I believe in Hell. But I do remember the Black Shuck, and the way Mary’s spirit was transformed in Blue Earth. That came from somewhere. Was it a demon? I don’t know if I believe in demons. I’ve seen people who thought they were demons, and acted like demons —but how would you know the difference between a demon and a shape-shifter? How would you kno?</p>

  <p>At the mouth of the spillway we found this godawful fluid trickling straight out of the concrete. Dark brown, stinking of sulfur. It burned your fingers to touch it. Bill drew a figure around it, he called it a Devil’s Trap from a book called the Key of Solomon. Psalm 90:13. He used charcoal to draw the trap on the wall of the spillway around the sulfur, and then I laid it out on the ground in front of the tunnel, using salt. Kosher salt, no added iodides. Bill said this was important. He started watching the sky as the sun set. The first stars would tell him when the hellspawn was coming through, he said. I looked up with him, but the stars just looked like stars to me. I have so much to learn. There I was in Pasadena, the boys back at the roadhouse. I wasn’t being a father. I was being a hunter. I was hunting. And while I looked up at the sky, I made a simple mistake. I didn’t pay attention to where my feet were, and I scuffed the salt. Just a little. But enough that when something came out of the mouth of the tunnel, nothing stopped it.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img014.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>It looked like smoke, and sounded like a million flies. Bill looked down from the stars just in time for it to flow right into him. He started jerking like a condemned man in the electric chair, and two voices were coming out of his mouth. One was the thing, the hellspawn. I don’t know what language it was speaking, but its voice was horrible. It was the sound cancer would make if it could talk. And Bill, he kept saying over and over again, John, shoot me, shoot me, John.</p>

  <p>So I did.</p>

  <p>It was the worst mistake I ever made. It was careless and stupid and it got a good man killed. A husband and father, and a damned good hunter, and I don’t know how I’m going to explain this to Ellen. And Jo, poor Jo. She’s four years old. How am I going to tell her? I can’t just let Ellen do it. I’m responsible. It was over in less than a minute, Bill Harvelle dead and me standing there with a gun in my hand listening to the echo of the gunshot in the hills and the echo of that awful hellspawn voice in my head.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img015.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>And to the end, Bill was teaching me. With his body dying and something inside him, he staggered over to the sulfur-stinking wall and let the smoke back out —straight into the Devil’s Trap on the wall. Then he took a step back, careful not to do what I did, and then he sat down and died leaning against the spillway wall under the Devil’s Trap he’d drawn. He saved my life even though I took his. It was a hunter’s death.</p>

  <p>I copied the Devil’s Trap, but I didn’t need to. I couldn’t forget it if I wanted to.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Tahlequah, OK. Sammy is three years old today. We celebrated with an ice-cream cake. He was still wearing most of it when he fell asleep. Dean’s sleeping too, the two of them in the bed. The room only has one bed. I’ll sleep on the floor, if I sleep at all. Some night it’s enough to watch them sleep, and know that if they start to have a nightmare I’ll be right there to stop it.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Dean started second grade. I watch him like a hawk. He makes me swear that I’ll take good care of Sammy before he’ll go to school. God, I love that kid. I have the day with Sammy while Dean is learning whatever kids learn in second grade. Sammy’s a very different kid. He hasn’t taken to the idea of hunting bad guys, and he’s still too young to really understand what it means to avenge his mother. To him, her death just means she’s not here, and he doesn’t remember her. For him, Mary is a word. A mother, to him, is something he never had —but he’s still supposed to be sad that she died. I don’t think he gets it. How could he, really?</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="October 30"><span id="october-30">October 30:</span><a href="#october-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">I saw an exorcism today. Or something that looked like an exorcism. According to Jim, there really are demons. I don’t know if I believed that —he’s a pastor, so of course he does, but… demons? From Hell? Even after the things I’ve seen these past three years (almost), I can’t quite make demons fit. But between watching what happened to Bill at Devil’s Gate, and what I saw today… i don’t know.</p>

  <p>Jim knows I have the journal. After he was done, and the girl was looking around like someone, who’d just woken up from the worst nightmare you can imagine, he took me back to his church and had me copy down a shorter version of the Rituale Romanum exorcism ritual. Usually, he said, you don’t have to read the whole thing. Most demons can’t hold out that long. But he wants me to copy the whole thing just in case. So I’m going to. I don’t know if I believe in demons, but I’m not sure I can disbelieve them anymore, either.</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">In the expulsion of demonic forces or energie residing in an individual, soul possession, command of one’s motor and abilities.</p>

  <p>The Rituale Romanum was widely used in the midto late 13th century in most of eastern Europe until the church banned its use in the beginning of the 14th century. Initial studies indicate that this anti-curse was particularly helpful in ridding the individual of unwanted guests. The first part of the ritual expels the entity from the host. The second half of the ritual banishes the spirit back from whence it came. Repeat the incantantions as follows:</p>

  <div class="cita cursiva">
    <ol>
      <li>
        <div class="asangre">
          <p>Regna Terrae, cantate deo,</p>

          <p>psallite domino,</p>

          <p>qui vehitur per calus</p>

          <p>caelos antiquos!</p>

          <p class="salto05">Ecce, edit vocem suam, vocem potentem:</p>

          <p>Akinoscite potentiam dei!</p>

          <p>Majestas ejus,</p>

          <p>Et potentia ejus</p>

          <p>In nubibus.</p>
        </div>
      </li>

      <li>
        <div class="asangre">
          <p class="salto10">Timedus est dues e sancto suo,</p>

          <p>dues Israel; ipse potentiam</p>

          <p>datet robur populo suo</p>

          <p>benedictus dues.</p>

          <p class="salto05">Gloria Patri.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <p>On the completion of the first part of the incantantion the demon may take one or more of several forms ranging from liquid to gaseous to corporeal to any combination of the aforementioned. Great care must be taken in performing the second part of the ritual. The demon upon expulsion can become very powerful without the need of a host. Beware that the spirit can enter a host through any opening in the host. Keep your eyes open and mouth shut.</p>

  <p>In Michigan, they call October 30 Devil’s Night.</p>

She doesn’t know that Dean watches his little brother like a hawk every minute, with an expression on his face that says he’s willing to die to keep Sammy safe. She doesn’t know that it’s because I have drilled it into Dean and Sammy is his responsibility. He’s eight years old, and I’ve told him his brother’s life is in his hands.

Sed quid truculente reniteris? Quid temerarie detrectas? Reus es omnipotenti Deo, cujus statuta transgressus es.

Discede ergo nunc, discede, seductor. Tibi eremus sedes est. Tibi habitatio serpens est: humiliare, et prosternere. Jam non est differendi tempus. Ecce enim dominator Dominus proximat cito, et ignis ardebit ante ipsum, et praecedet, et inflammabit in circuitu inimicos ejus. Si enim hominem fefelleris, Deum non poteris irridere. Ille te ejicit, cujus oculis nihil occultum est. Ille te expellit, cujus virtuti universa subjecta sunt.

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is four today. And sure enough, we’re in Colorado. That’s three out of four birthdays we’ve been visiting Daniel. The mountains are a good place to spend early May. Maybe we should make a tradition of it —but I have a feeling that we’re not in any place to start traditions. I had to pull Dean out of school when I got a note from Ellen that someone passing through the roadhouse had just exorcised a demon that knew where we were.</p>

  <p>I think hunters call something a demon when they don’t know what it is. The word is easy to throw around. But whatever it was, if the Winchesters were on its mind, it’s the enemy. So we’re moving for two reasons. One, the enemy knows where we are. Two, I’m going to go after him where he is… as soon as I figure that out. So we’re in Colorado, on our way to Texas. Dean understands.</p>

  <p>Sammy gets Daniel’s books down from the shelves and pretends to read them. He can pick out some words, but what he’s really after the pictures. Like any kid his age. We stopped by here because I took out a strange kind of revenant in April, one I’ve never seen before. It was in Greektown, Detroit. Daniel figured it out right away.</p>

    <p class="salto10 asangre">VRYKOLAKAS: Unconsecrated burial, returns to either murder people in the graveyard or cause problems in the house it left. Sometimes appears as human, other times as a sort of werewolf (although in some versions, the vrykolakas is destroyed by being dug up and eaten by a wolf). Can drain the life force of the sleeper, similar to succubus/incubus or mara.</p>

    <p>stories vary widely, often incorporating elements of the poltergeist. Sometimes the vrykolakas attacks and kills people; other times it plagues their sleep; other times only children die; other times it is only waiting to be dispatched by its surviving family members’ fulfillment of a promise. Much overlap betwen vrykolakas lore and that of vampires. Not sure if one is a subspecies of the other, or if confusion in the lore has obscured the real differences.</p>

    <p class="salto05">VETALA: Hostile spirits from Indian lore, will animate corpses —their own or others— to move around. Haunt cemeteries and creation grounds. Will attack in cemeteries; can also drive people mad. Will kill children, possibly to eat, and are known to induce miscarriages. Trapped between the material world and the afterlife, can be dispelled by the performance of funeral rites. NOTE: Exorcism will not work on a vetala. They aren’t demons in the sense of the Judeo-Crhistian ritual. If caught in the right mood, a vetala might tell you the past and future, for this reason they’re much sought after by sorcerers… mostly resulting in fatal mishaps for those sorcerers, since if caught in the wrong mood, a vetala is lethal before you know it’s there. Best idea is to get on with the funeral rites and send them on their way.</p>

  <p class="asangre">From the mouths of babes… we were in Portland, Maine, because I’d heard of a Miqmaq shaman named David Fowler who lived there. I told him some of my story, and he agreed to raise a manitou and let me ask it some questions. We went down into the basement of his house and he started getting the divination ready. I’m the only white man who’s ever seen it, he said, and he was only doing it for me as a favor to the other hunters he knew. He burned sacred tobacco, and some other herbs I didn’t recognize. The room got more smokey than it seems like it should have. The manitou appeared, and I got right to the point, I asked it who or what killed Mary. And then things went wrong.</p>

  <p>I still don’t know whether Fowler made a mistake, or whether a different spirit rode up into our world with the manitou. But whatever happened, it turned out into something physical and real. Like a bear, kind of. And before I could stop it, it killed Fowler. It almost killed me too, but I fought it. I don’t know if I would have won, because the spirit let go of its form, animated Fowler’s body, and went out through the basement window. I got the hell out of there and picked up the boys. We were almost to the New Hampshire state line and I’d told Dean a little about what had happened, because I was so frustrated and ashamed that I had to talk to someone. Sammy was asleep the whole time.</p>

  <p>Then Dean asked me one of those killer questions that little kids come up with. “Dad,” he says. “Won’t the manitou go after other people now?”</p>

  <p>That’s a hard thing to face. Not that he asked the question, or that he was right, but that he had a better sense of right and wrong than I did. We were back at Fowler’s house an hour later, and that night I tracked him down and killed him. He was prowling around the edges of a Cub Scout campout in a place called Bradbury Mountain. God knows what would have happened if Dean hadn’t spoken up.</p>

  <p>I came this close to going completely off the rails. I almost let this quest overwhelm what I know is right, and a bunch of kids almost died because of it. A hunter never passes up a hunt, and a hunter never bails out on a hunt. That will never happen again. Never. I will not fail Mary’s memory, and I will not fail the boys.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img017.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p class="mano salto10">The Miqmaq chenoo is a winter spirit with a heart of ice, created from a human which wants to kill those it loves. In the period of transformation, the person who is becoming a chenoo eats snow and refuses other food. He will be ill-tempered and angry. After the transformation, the chenoo will attack and kill other members of the tribe —or anyone else. If it is killed, the body must be completely burned, or else the smallest part of it can be used to create another chenoo. Much in common with the wendigo legends found farther west. I don’t know if that’s the kind of spirit that caught Fowler. It was summer; I don’t think so. But when I went back to his house, I took a book. I read a dead man’s book. Next time I’ll be ready.</p>

    <p class="centrado negrita">SALT</p>

    <p class="asangre">Symbol of permanence, incorruptibility. The word “salvation” originates from the use of salt in sealing covenants. Jews in the Temple offered salt, still use it in Sabbath rituals. Leviticus 2:13: “And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.” Lot’s wife turns to salt as a reminder of permanence of errors. In II Kings, Elisha purifies a spring with salt. Jesus coined the phrase “salt of the earth” for apostles, because of their commitment. Salt used in some Catholic consecration rituals. Spilled salt should never be picked up; the bad luck is balanced by throwing salt over the shoulder at the demons who approach because of the spill. Buddhist tradition holds that salt repels all evil spirits. Throw salt over your shoulder before entering your house after attending a funeral; will prevent spirits dinging from the funeral from getting in. Salt used to purify in Shinto and other traditions; Shinto myth says firs landmass, Ongoro Shima, arose when salt separated from a world ocean. Native American tribes in the southwest restricted who could eat salt. Hopi legends about the preciousness of salt held that location of salt deposits —hard to get to, dangerous to work— was a punishment from the warrior Twins.</p>

    <p>Practical uses: a line of salt is a barrier no spirit can cross. Mediums use lines to constrain movements of summoned spirits. In Japanese floklore, ghosts are packed in jars full of salt. A double-barrel load of rock salt will dispel the ectoplasmic manifestation of a spirit. When destroying a spirit permanently, salt the remains or focus of the haunting before burning. “The devil loveth no salt in his meat.” Scottish fishermen used to throw salt into the ocean to blind malicious faeries.</p>

    <p>In Norse myth, ancestor of the gods was born from a salt lick.</p>

    <p>Dark side of salt the earth after a battle so that nothing will grow, no one will live there. Can be reversed to a symbol of barrenness.</p>

    <p>Myth among Caribbean slaves that Africans —Igbo, in particular— can fly because they did not eat salt in their native country.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is five today. Thank God. He almost didn’t make it.</p>

  <p>I could blame Dean, but it’s my fault. There’s enough blame to go around. I missed the kill, and I left Dean watching Sam, and he couldn’t pull the trigger when he needed to. I haven’t taught him well enough. If he is weak like that again, my boys will die… but what kind of father am I to put a nine-year-old boy in a situation where he might have to kill to protect his brother?</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img018.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>I’m the kind of father I have to be. I’m the kind of father who teaches his boys that no man or monster can kill their mother and get away with it. I’m the kind of father who shows them that when it comes to family, you go to the ends of the earth to put things right.</p>

  <p>We’re in Wisconsin, so we might as well skip over to Blue Earth and check in with Jim. He’ll want to know about this, and maybe it’ll do me good to talk to him.</p>

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="salto10 asangre">Reminder: Tell Jim about the Hausa, an African tribe whose witches keep magical stones in their stomachs. They eat their victims’ souls slowly, causing the victim to waste away and die. Also, they can turn into dogs. Another African witch, sukuyadyo or obayito, bind victims magically and drain their blood or life force. Sukuyadyo can change their skins, hiding their real skin under a pot or mortar in their house and taking the appearance of another. Related to skinwalker, also variations of medieval European vampire legends. Obayito transformed into a ball of light to drain life force (will-o’-the-wisp.)</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva">Here Perimedes and Euylochus held the victims, while I drew my sword and dug the trench a cubit each way. I made a drink-offering to all the dead, first with honey and milk, then with wine, and thirdly with water, and I sprinkled white barley meal over the whole, praying earnestly to the poor feckless ghosts, and promising them that when I got back to Ithaca I would sacrifice a barren heifer for them, the best i had, and would load the pyre with good things. I also particularly promised that Teiresias should have a black sheep to himself, the best in all my flocks. When I had prayed sufficiently to the dead, I cut the throats of the two sheep and let the blood run into the trench, whereon the ghosts came trooping up from Erebus —brides, young bachelors, old men worn out with toil, maids who had been crossed in love, and brave men who had been killed in battle, with in battle, with their armour still smirched with blood; they came from every quarter and flitted round the trench with a strange kind of screaming sound that made me turn pale with fear. When I saw them coming I told the men to be quick and flay the carcasses of the two dead sheep and make burnt offerings of them, and at the same time to repeat prayers to Hades and to Proserpine; but I sat where I was with my sword drawn and would not let the poor feckless ghosts come near the blood till Teireias should have answered my questions.</p>

  <p class="asangre">This is how you spend your holiday weekends when you’re a hunter.</p>

  <p>I got Sammy and Dean into a day camp not too far from Blue Earth, so I could consult with Pastor Jim about a few things while the boys got to be regular kids for a while. Should have known that not even summer camp could be normal for the Winchesters. On the fifth day of the camp, Dean was canoeing through an easy rapids on the Blue Earth River. Things went bad. Dean swore to me when he came back that he’d seen something —only he said “someone”— capsize the canoe. I didn’t think about it too much… until the next week, when another canoe went over and the counselor paddling it died. I spent a couple of days looking into it, and ran across a Cree legend about humanoid tricksters called mannegishi. They live in river rapids and like to tip canoes, but they usually don’t get malevolent unless the locals do something to make them angry. So what was it?</p>

  <p>Turns out the camp is expanding, and part of the work involved blasting some riverside rock formations that used to have pictographs showing the Cree’s reverence for the little bastards. The mannegishi didn’t like having those gone, and started to take it out on the campers.</p>

  <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img031.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>I’d have killed every one of them for coming after Dean, but the truth is they had a right to be mad. So I kept my head and got Jim to put me in touch with a Cree medicine man who lived over in South Dakota. I complained about the distance, and Jim told me to shut up and be happy I didn’t have to go to Montana or Saskatchewan, where most of the Cree live now. The medicine man called himself Joey Tall Pine, which I figure is a moniker he took on for the tourists, but after the last six years, I’m the last guy in the world who gets to complain about someone using an alias. I gave him a ride back to Blue Earth and we went down to the rapids that night (now two days ago). He talked things over with the mannegishi, and they struck a bargain. They’d stop going after kids at the camp if Joey redid some of the pictographs somewhere and guaranteed that they wouldn’t be destroyed. Jim stepped in and said, hey, I don’t have nearly enough aquatic tricksters in the creek behind my house. Presto —mannegishi in Jim’s creek, and Joey Tall Pine got to exercise his pictographic talent.</p>

  <p>Part of me still wants to kill them, because of what happened to Dean, but when I take a minute to cool off I realize that it’s the camp’s fault. Some day camp, wrecking pictographs so they can expand their boat launch. The boys are going someplace else next week, for as long as we can stay.</p>

  <p>Anyway, it’s over now. Fireworks going off, I’ve got a couple of beers in me, the boys are asleep in a tent out in Jim’s backyard. For the moment, the battle pauses. Mary, I can’t fight every minute.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="August 18"><span id="august-18">August 18:</span><a href="#august-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Other water spirits I’ve read up on:</p>

  <p>Vodyanoy. Russian male water spirit, sometimes said to be a shape-shifter but more often appears as an old man, skin freckled with scales, a green beard tangled with much and underwater plants. May live in whirlpools. In larger bodies of water, often lives in sunken ships, served by the drowned ghosts of the ships’ crews. Drowns people to serve him as slaves, but also protects fishermen who appease him by giving him the first fish of their catch. Likes butter and tobacco.</p>

  <p>Also likes the rusalka, and often either marries one or takes several as servants or concubines. Rusalki are spirits of women who are murdered or die by suicide in the water —sometimes children who were drowned by their mothers. (See Woman in White.) The adult versions sing to seduce passersby or sailors, then draw them underwater to become their spirit lovers. Lore sometimes suggest vampiric qualities. Some rusalki will vanish if their deaths are avenged. Can also be dispelled if kept out of water long enough for her hair to dry completely. The child versions can be dispelled by baptism with holy water.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img032.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Have heard of vodyanoy from hunters in Alaska. Never seen one. Shoshone legends from Wyoming tell of Water Ghost Woman, who beguiles hunters and travelers with sexual attraction, also shoots them with spirit arrows.</p>

  <p>The Germanic Nix combines attributes of voydanoy and rusalka. In human forma, the Nix is usually male and handsome, and dangerous to unmarried women and unbaptized children. Most active at summer and winter solstice (Christianized versions of the legend say Christmas Eve). Plays music to beguile its target. Also an omen of drowning —similar to banshee— can be heard screaming from the water, signaling that someone is going to drown there. Like vodyanoy, the Nix likes tobacco, and also vodka. Can be made to appear by dripping blood into water, or by sacrificing a black animal.</p>

  <p>Once, in Pinckney, Michigan, I suckered a Nix by using a Black Shuck as the sacrifice. That was a show, a demon dog tangling with a water spirit. The Shuck won, and I sent it back to Hell for its trouble.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the Nix appears as a horse called Bäckahästen, which, if ridden, will leap into the nearest body of water, drowning the rider. Overlap here with Celtic/Scottish stories of the kelpie and each uisge. Kelpies appear from the fog near rivers, and, if ridden, drown their riders. The each uisge can be ridden safely as long as it can’t see or smell water. The minute it does, it drags the rider in and devours him, leaving only the liver.</p>

  <p>This last detail I thought was just storyteller’s elaboration until I tangled with an each uisge at the Quabbin Reservoir in Massachusetts. That one took human form, too, and looked like a handsome young man who always had weeds in his hair. I was lucky to get out with my liver.</p>

  <p>I used to like swimming, but that’s one more thing I lost to the job. Water spirits don’t need much water, either. See British legends of Jenny Greenteeth or Peg-o’-the-Well. Egyptian El Nadaha (“the caller”) lures children into canals to drown them.</p>

  <p>Also have heard from other hunters about a hundred old racetrack in Goshen, NY. A horse and rider who drowned right after the turn of the century come back and ride across the lake, sometimes chasing or threatening people in the area. Bäckahästen, sounds like? But I haven’t seen anywhere else that a human could be transformed into one.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 2"><span id="november-2">November 2:</span><a href="#november-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Mary has been dead for six years. Today I overheard the boys talking about her, about her death. Sammy’s old enough now to be asking hard questions, and I think that’s making Dean think about some things that he’d put away until now. He’s a tough little kid, Dean. Like me. But he’s also like me in the way the holds things in. Now his little brother is asking him things and he’s got to figure out a way to protect Sammy while Sammy’s questions put him through the emotional wringer all over again. And what do I do? They were talking to each other. If I butt in, they’ll clamp up. They’ve got the kid bond, the kind that keeps adults out. They’d tell me what I wanted to hear, but the truth is I can’t get at the real way they feel about their mother, because I can’t let them get at my feelings. It kills me every day. There’s no way to tell them that. We have to go on and find whatever killed their mother, my wife. Mary.</p>

  <p>For the boy’s sake, I’m going to try to stay in one place for longer. Keep the hunting trips to a few hours’ drive. At least until I have a firmer lead on what killed Mary. Then all bets are off.</p>

I need to be better around reading to him —stuff other than field manuals and weird newspaper headlines. He’s okay at math, and he knows some scientific stuff, because e’s seen people doing some weird experiments at the roadhouse and Pastor Jim’s, but he neds your basic little kid school stuff. I’d ask Dean to do it, but there’s only so much you can pile on a kid. Having Sammy’s life in his hands is enough for Dean; he can’t be responsible for home-schooling Sammy too. God. This is more time I’m reminded how much we need Mary.</p>

    <p>Sir Frank Sweettenham has described how a spirit-raising séance was conducted by a royal female shaman during the illness of a ruler of Perak some thirty years ago. The magician, dressed like a man, sat with veiled head before a taper in her right hand a sheaf of grass cut square at top and bottom. This sheaf she took convulsively. The taper flared, a signal that the spirit invoked was entering the candle. The magician, now supposed to be in a trance, bowed to the taper “and to each male member of the reigning family present!” After many spirits had been invoked, the sick raja was brought out and seated on a sixteen-sided stand (an improvement on the double pentacle called Solomon’s seat) to await, with shrouded head and a square bunch of grass in his hand, the advent of the spirits of the State. Conducted back to bed, His Highness fell later into a swoon attributed to possession by those spirits! At this royal séance the magician’s daughter led an orchestra of “five or six girls holding native drums, instruments with a skin stretched over one side only” and beaten with the fingers.</p>

    <p>In an account of yet another séance in Selangor, where to cure an ailment the magician became possessed by the tiger-spirit, it is said that the ceremony usually took place on three nights and that the same odd number of persons should be present each time. For the reception of the spirit an artificial bouquet of flowers, doves and centipedes, all made of palm-leaf, was prepared. After an invocation the magician bathed himself in incense, suffered spasmodic convulsions, spoke a spirit language, became possessed, sat with shrouded head, lit tapers on the edges of three jars of water, and rubbed the patient with a bezoar stoner. Then donning a white coat and head-doth, he fumigated a dagger, dropped silver coins into the three jars, and gazed to see their position under the three tapers, declaring that it indicated the gravity of the patient’s illness. Scattering handfuls of charmed rice round the jars, he put into them improvised bouquets of areca-palm blossom, and plunged his dagger into each bouquet to dispel lurking spirits of evil. Another sheaf of palm-blossom he anointed with oil and used for stroking the patient from head to heel. Next he was possessed by the tiger-spirit, scratched, growled, and licked the naked body of the patient. He drew blood from his own arm with the point of the dagger and fenced with his invisible spirit foe. Once more he stroked the patient with the sheaf of blossom and with his hands. Again he stabbed the bouquets, stroked the patient, and after lying still for an interval recovered consciousness.</p>

    <p class="asangre salto10">Psychopomp. Term for god or entity responsible for guiding souls to the afterlife. In Greece, Hermes. In Norse myth, the Valkyries. In Egypt, Anubis. Voodoo traditions, going back to their African roots, offer the Ghede. Irish, Ankou. In most shamanic traditions, the shaman is a sort of psychopomp both at the beginning of life and at the end. He or she was present at birth to usher the child into the world, and present at death to see the soul on its journey. Medieval legends of the scythe-bearing Grim Reaper perhaps connected to practice in some parts of Europe whereby the dead were stabbed or buried with sickles. The real reapers are purely psychic entities, with power over time and perception. They can change the way a human sees his surroundings, and change their own appearance, usually to ease the transition from life into death. The reaper’s true form is hard to pin down, but most accounts suggest that the natural way for a living person to see a reaper is as a wraith-figure wearing tattered winding sheets or burial cloth.</p>

    <p>Black dogs are also psychopomps sometimes. Buried in the foundations of churches to guard and protect the gates between here and the afterlife.</p>

But as I looked into that stinking mouth, I wondered for the hundredth time: when’s my time gonna come? And if something happens to me, who’ll take care of the boys? Dean tries to be the big man a lot, but he’s not even twelve. And Sam’s just seven. Just trying to do this without you is hard enough, Mary… Mary…</p>

  <p>Focus. The Beast of Bray Road. It’s the Black Shuck and the hellhound all over again. Where do these black dogs come from? Agrippa had a black dog, said to be his familiar —he freed it from his deathbed and it trotted outside, never to be seen again. If you can believe anything anyone says about Agrripa. Even Churchill called his depression his black dog. What was really getting to him? He maybe needed a hunter around.</p>

    <p class="asangre">Mooney, Sacred Formulas of the Cherokee:</p>

    <p class="asangre">When the shaman wishes to destroy the life of another, either for his own purposes or for hire, he conceals himself near the trail along which the victim is likely to pass. When the doomed man appears the shaman waits until he has gone by and then follows him secretely until he chances to spit upon the ground. On coming up to the spot the shaman collects upon the end of a stick a little of the dust thus moistened with the victim’s spittle. The possession of the man’s spittle gives him power over the life of the man himself. Many ailments are said by the doctors to be due to the fact that some enemy has by this means “changed the spittle” of the patient and caused it to breed animals or sprout corn in the sick man’s body. In the love charms also the lover always figuratively “takes the spittle” of the girl in order to fix her affections upon himself. The same idea in regard to spittle is found in European folk medicine.</p>

    <p>The shaman then puts the clay thus moistened into a tube consisting of a joint in the Kanesâ’la or wild parsnip, a poisonous plant of considerable importance in life-conjuring ceremonies. He also puts into the tube seven earthworms beaten into a paste, and several splinters from a tree which has been struck by lightning. The idea in regard to the worms is not quite clear, but it may be that they are expected to devour the soul of the victim, as earthworms are supposed to feed upon dead bodies, or perhaps it is thought that from their burrowing habits they may serve to hollow out a grave for the soul under the earth, the quarter to which the shaman consigns it. In other similar ceremonies the dirt-dauber asp or the stinging ant is buried in the same manner in order that it may kill the soul, as these are said to kill other more powerful insects by their poisonous sting or bite. The wood of a tree struck by lightning is also a potent spell for both good and evil and is used in many formulas of various kinds.</p>

    <p>Having prepared the tube, the shaman goes into the forest, to a tree which has been struck by lightning. At its base he digs a hole, in the bottom of which he puts a large yellow stone slab. He then puts in the tube, together with seven yellow pebbles, fills in the earth, and finally builds a fire over the spot to destroy all traces of his work. The yellow stones are probably chosen as the next best substitute for black stones, which are not always easy to find. The formula mentions “black rock,” black being the emblem of death, while yellow typifies trouble. The shaman and his employer fast until after the ceremony.</p>

    <p>If the ceremony has been properly carried out, the victim becomes blue, that is, he feels the effects in himself at once, and, unless he employs the countercharms of some more powerful shaman, his soul begins to shrivel up and dwindle, and within seven days he is dead.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="January 3"><span id="january-3">January 3:</span><a href="#january-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Something new yesterday. I took out a nest of succubi —at least that’s what everyone I talked to says they were. Sexually predatory, voracious demons. They can change their appearance, and they all transformed to look like Mary at one point. God help me, I was weak. It was like seeing her again, in the flesh, and I let myself believe for just a minute. Or not believe, really. I agreed to their deception. And then, when I’d gotten my head straight again, I killed them. All of them. Was going to stay here for a while, but I think we’ll need to be on our way. I’m going to stay in the West. Maybe New Mexico next, so we would be close to Daniel. I’m learning a lot from him, even though I’ve still never seen a vampire.</p>

  <p>Succubi exist across world mythologies. Judeo-Christian versions have them as female demons who harvest semen that incubi (male version) then use to impregnate women with children who are more readily possessed by demons —or who are more likely to become witches. Birth defects were also said to be the result of incubi. A parallel European tradition, of the night-mare, is a creature which rides the sleeper, partially suffocating him and at the same time causal sexual dreams. The four succubi named in the Zohar are Naamah, Lilith, Elsheth Zenunium, ang Agrat Bat Mahlat. Naamah was regarded as the inventor of divination, and in some traditions as a patron spirit of music.</p>

  <p>In certain strains of Hebrew myth, incubi and succubi are generally called lilin and lilith. They are said to be the children of Lilith, and to die at a rate of one hundred per day because she would not come back to Adam. They can prey on children —boys until circumcision at eight days, and girls for twenty days— but also attack women by causing infertility and difficult births, even miscarriages. Men become victims of the lilith by being ridden at night, the seed being used to create more demonic children.</p>

  <p>An amulet inscribed with the initials of the three Magi —Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar— is said to protect children from lilin and lilith.</p>

  <p>Other traditions include Greek empusa, which attacked travelers but also drained their life force through intercourse, and Turkish Al Basti (which also kidnaps horses). Martin Luther referred to Melusine as a succubus, but she doesn’t seem to fit the mold; Melusine is more of a swan-maiden/selkie/kitsune type.</p>

  <p>The succubi I killed said something about having plans for the Winchesters. Guess they’ll have to cancel those plans.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="January 24"><span id="january-24">January 24:</span><a href="#january-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Dean turn twelve today. School has started again, but we’re going to move on. Next week, the Winchesters are going to be residents of Albuquerque. Dean’s going to be a normal sixth grader for at least the next couple of months. He even talked about wanting to play baseball this spring, but I’m not sure he’s serious. I think he’s taking his cues from me, talking about everyday stuff when I try to keep us in one place. Then when we’re on the road again, all he can talk about is hunting.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="March 17"><span id="march-17">March 17:</span><a href="#march-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">In the last week, Sammy has played a sunbeam in the school play and I killed a demon inhabiting the body of an old woman. It knew something the succubi, I think. We’re being followed. Or are we? Am I getting paranoid? I have every reason to be, but it’s something I have to guard against. The boys are doing well. Sammy’s talking about doing a science project to enter in the fair next month. He’s really taken to his teacher, Ms. Lyle, and she’s encouraging him. Smart kid, Sammy. It was warm today, and the boys kicked a soccer ball around. That’s one of the nice things about Albuquerque. I picked up a job working construction. Feels good to be punching a clock again, actually. The regular rhythm of it. Part of me needs that. I thought about going back to turning wrenches, but it didn’t feel right. I think a lot of things died in Lawrence, and that dream was one of them.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="April 1"><span id="april-1">April 1:</span><a href="#april-1" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Monday, I walked away from another job, and my younger son almost was kidnapped by some kind of demon. Sammy qualified for the New Mexico Science Fair, and his teacher, Ms. Lyle, said she’d take him. Only she started to take him somewhere else. I don’t know where, but I caught up to her at a crossroads. She would have killed me, and taken Sammy, but Dean came through. I don’t have any words for how proud I am of him. His brother’s under some kind of spell, there’s a giant monster made out of train parts coming after me, and he has the presence of mind to find this journal and read the exorcism out of it. I almost lost both of my boys today. Ms. Lyle, or the thing calling itself Ms. Lyle, wanted Sammy for something. It reminds me of the variant stories about succubi/lamiae taking children children, or killing children. And if I’m honest with myself, I have to take that train of thought all the way: the stories also say that succubi come to claim the children that have been fathered by incubi, which is ridiculous.</p>

  <p>I still don’t know what Ms. Lyle wanted. She just said Sam was special.</p>

  <p>We’re on the road again. How am I going to explain to Sammy that we’re not going back to school? How am I going to explain Ms. Lyle?</p>

  <p>To top it all off, I had to give Sammy a sharp lecture on not talking to strangers. While I was on the phone with Bobby, he just got out of the car and went up to a black Seville. I read him the riot act —Dean too, since he let it happen and it’s his job to watch Sammy. All Sammy would say about it was that the guy wanted to know where we were going.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="April 7"><span id="april-7">April 7:</span><a href="#april-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">In Sioux Falls to meet Bobby, boys along since it’s not safe for them to be in Albuquerque anymore. Between the two of us, Bobby and I hashed out what’s been going on with Ms. Lyle and the others. Bobby thinks I’m a fool for not wanting to believe that demons really exist, and he’s not shy about telling me. Probably he’s right. All the signs were there with Ms. Lyle. But if you buy demons, you have to buy Hell, and if you buy Hell, you have to buy Satan, which means you have to buy God, right? I can’t sign on to one belief if it means I have to take the others. Only Bobby says that he’s never run across a demon who’s laid eyes on the Devil. Most demons apparently don’t even believe he exists. The way Bobby put it is that demons are a lot like us where belief is concerned. I don’t see it that way. If demons exist, they are nothing like us.</p>

  <p>But I guess I think they do exist. And I think Ms. Lyle was one. I was in bed with her… that thing… and it was a demon. I let it trick me away from the mission. I let myself be led, I let myself be convinced that everything can be normal again, and it was all a tactic. She wanted something from me, and she thought she knew how to get it.</p>

  <p>And she was almost right. I’ve been lonely since Mary… I wanted to be touched. Just contact. And looking back, it makes me sick.</p>

  <p>Have been reading up on crossroads out of Bobby’s library. There’s a nearly universal folk-magic tradition that crossroads are gateways between worlds. Robert Johnson: “I went to the crossroads/trying to flag a ride.” And then he writes “Hellhound on My Trail,” too. Wonder if he knew something… plenty of stories that he sold his soul to the Devil, but people have been saying that about musicians since medieval times. Another medieval note: criminals and suicides used to be buried at crossroads. A sacrifice to the spirits that used those gateways?</p>

  <p>Papa Legba in voodoo magic is the loa of crossroads. You go to him if you want to talk to the iwa, the gods (going back to Yoruba traditions). He is the gatekeeper, also perhaps a psychopomp —like Eshu (sometimes called Ellegua in the Yoruba/Lukumi, later Exu in Brazilian folk magic). Eshu is the patron of travelers, god of crossroads. He’s also a trickster, sometimes a cruel one. Both Eshu and Papa Legba must be the first of any spirits invoked if a magical or divination ritual is going to work. His symbol, called a veve:</p>

  <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img037.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Veve is inscribed on the floor in some kind of powder. It can be anything from flour to gunpowder, depending on the ceremony. Hoodoo traditions prescribe certain actions at crossroads to gain gifts in music, love, or power. Or money.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="April 18"><span id="april-18">April 18:</span><a href="#april-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Went to see Silas last night. He’s an old friend of Bobby’s, some kind of soothsayer who sells tires. I went to his place and his daughter told me he’s been in a coma… since last November 2, the seventh anniversary of Mary’s death. When I went to see him at the hospital, he snapped out of it long enough to tell me a couple of things I didn’t want to hear.</p>

  <p>One, he thinks that Sammy’s special somehow.</p>

  <p>Two, Dean and I need to be ready “for what’s to come.”</p>

  <p>Then he was gone again, out cold. What the hell does it mean? Why Sammy? What does he have to do with any of this? And what is coming? Silas either couldn’t say anything else, or wouldn’t. He said I brought him out of his coma, and then he was gone back into it.</p>

  <p>Tomorrow I’m going to leave Sammy with Bobby so I can take Dean deer hunting. It’s out of season, but the Dakotas are lousy with deer and Dean needs to pull a trigger to sharpen him up. Also I need to think about Sammy. Why was Ms. Lyle so interested in him?</p>

  <p>More voodoo. The houngan (man) or mambo (woman) is the priest. You need them to talk to the loas, also called orisha (loas also known as iwa —African and New World terminologies mix freely). Orisha are said to be beings who manifest aspects of the natural world, and aspects of a nameless god. So they straddle the physical and spirit worlds. The bokor is a magician-priest who can do both divination/séance magic and darker magic: hexes, charms, etc. They’re usually for hire. Bobby says that it’s possible to be both houngan and bokor. Bokor are the ones who make zombies.</p>

  <p>Ogun is the loa (or maybe iwa, or orisha?) of iron, smithy, hunting, fire, etc. He’s a warrior. His veve:</p>

  <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img038.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>I’ve been hearing about a magical gun. The story goes that Samuel Colt one Halloween night made a gun and thirteen bullets that could kill anything. Wonder if that gun exists, or if it’s just a hunter legend. And if it exists, I wonder where it is… Ogun would know. Tomorrow, after Dean and I go hunting, might be the time to ask him. Go to New Orleans? Must be a bokor down there who would do a hunter a favor.</p>

  <p>Other veves:</p>

  <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img039.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Baron Samedi, loa of the dead, stands at crossroads. Also loa of sex, known for his coarse apetites. Eros and Thanatos, all in one, dressed in tux and top hat. If you want to talk to him, bring plenty of booze and tobacco.</p>

  <p>Maman Brigitte, Baron Samedi’s wife, vulgar like her husband, likes to drink hot peppers. Protects gravestones if they are sanctified to her. She and Baron Samedi are related to the Ghede, a family of spirits that have to do with cemeteries, funerals, death, etc. Different traditions spell out the relationship differently. Either Samedi is a Ghede, or he created them or brought them to life, or he is an aspect of them and they speak through him.</p>

  <p>I have to sleep. Up early tomorrow.</p>

  <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img040.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="April 19"><span id="april-19">April 19:</span><a href="#april-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">The hunting trip was nearly a disaster. Dean missed his shot. I sent him after the buck, a beautiful twelve-pointer, and he dropped the gun when he tripped on the trail. Then out of nowhere comes Sammy, who picks up the gun and lays that big boy out. A seven-year-old… well, almost eight.</p>

  <p>Then he tells me that he thought the deer had taken Dean’s gun, and that Sammy had to protect him.</p>

  <p>It’s moments like those that kill me. I taught him that, Dean too. I taught them that everything should be seen as a threat. And now Sammy sees a deer and thinks it’s trying to hurt his brother.</p>

  <p>God.</p>

  <p>Things got worse from there because Sammy told me he’d gotten up, wanting to come after me and Dean, and found the man in the black Seville outside Bobby’s house. He rode in the Seville to the trailhead, and found us from there. I don’t even know how to get my head around that. I feel like I should punish him somehow, but the truth is I should be punishing myself.</p>

  <p>We get home, and Bobby tells me to go see Silas again. I didn’t want to do it, but when I got to his house, there he was, awake and standing in his front door like he’d never been sick in his life. I don’t know how to explain it. He said again that Sammy was special, and he wanted some time to talk to Sam and understand what was happening. So Dean and I left for an hour, and on the way back I saw the Seville.</p>

  <p>When we got to Silas’ place, there was Sammy, sitting on the porch. He said he and Silas talked for a while. I went inside, left Dean out with his brother to catch up. Inside… I’ve never seen anything like it. Or if I have, it was after an artillery strike in Nam. Silas was just in pieces, little bits of him stuck to the walls and the floor. Scrawled in blood on the kitchen cabinets, the words <span class="versalita">KILL HIM</span>.</p>

  <p>Now I’ve got to find the sonofabitch that killed Silas, too.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="April 20"><span id="april-20">April 20:</span><a href="#april-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Been on the run, running harder even than usual. The driver of the Seville called himself Anderson, said he was a hunter… and he was hunting Sam. He said Sam had killed Silas, but there’s no way that can be true. No little boy could have done what I saw in there. But Anderson wouldn’t listen, and now in the last twenty-four hours I’ve committed kidnapping, grand theft auto (well, semi), and murder. That’s five hunters I’ve killed, if you count H —but who really knows what he was? And I don’t know that Anderson was what he said he was, either. He passed up two chances to take Sammy out. I didn’t give him a third. And I didn’t give any of three Dowry brothers a chance at all.</p>

  <p>It was Dean who dilled Anderson. My oldest son is blooded. All I ever write about is death. Because all I ever see is death, and you know what? I did that to myself. It’s got to end, but it can’t end until I settle what happened to Mary.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="May 2"><span id="may-2">May 2:</span><a href="#may-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is eight years old today. Happy birthday, kiddo. No matter what the demons and soothsayers and lunatic albinos say, you’re special to me just because you’re my son. And I’m never going to let anything happen to you.</p>

  <p>Ms. Lyle was after Sammy because he has something she wants. She said he was special. So did Silas. What’s different about him? He’s just a boy. My boy.</p>

  <p>Have started reading about demonology because of Bobby. I still have a hard time believing it. So far I’m sorting through a couple of different books that he says are important.</p>

    <p class="salto10 centrado negrita">The Testament of Solomon (TS)</p>

    <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img041.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p class="asangre">Probably written 1st-4th century C.E. In Solomon’s voice, tells of the building of the Temple and of the binding of numerous demons to perform menial labor. Several of these demons not attested in other sources. The story goes on to tell how Solomon fell in love with a Jebusaean woman (Shunammite?) and desired her for a wife, but was told by the priests of Moloch that he could not have her unless he sacrificed five grasshoppers to Moloch. In a moment of weakness, he did, and fell away from God, becoming “the sports of idols and demons.”</p>

    <p>One of dozens of texts that characterize Solomon as an archmagician. Queen of Sheba characterized as a witch, unlike her presentation in the <span class="subrayado">OT</span>. Also interesting that the Koran refers to the tradition that Solomon built the Temple with the assistance of bound demons: see sura 21, 34, 38.</p>

    <p><span class="subrayado">PD</span>. In its entry on Gaap, says that Solomon wrote a book of conjurations, and “mingled therewithalall the holy names of God.”</p>

  <p class="asangre">Mary has been dead for eight years. I’ve been learning about reapers. There’s more than one, and it’s not always a hooded skeleton with a scythe, but that’s where I’ll start.<img alt class="imgdch" src="Images/img042.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload> The traditional Grim Reaper is a skeleton or solemn-looking man carrying a scythe, who cuts off people’s lives as though he were harvesting grain. Death personified is a figure or fictional character which has existed in mythology and popular culture since the earliest days of storytelling. Because the reality of death has had a substantial influence on the human psyche and the development of civilization as a whole, the personification of Death as a living, sentient entity is a concept that has existed in all known societies since the beginnings of recorded history. In the United States, Death is usually shown as a skeletal figure wearing a midnight-black gown with a hood, while in Europe he is often depicted similarly but dressed in white, which is the traditional color worn at funerals in many places.</p>

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="salto10 asangre">Examples of death personified are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In modern-day European-based folklore, Death is known as the Grim Reaper or the Grim Spectre of Death.</li>

      <li>In Islam, Death is portrayed as Azrael, the angel of death (note that the name “Azrael” does not appear in any versions of either the Bible or the Koran).</li>

      <li>Father Time is sometimes said to be Death.</li>

      <li>Psychopomp is a spirit, deity, or other being whose task is to conduct the souls of the recently dead into the afterlife.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In Ugaritic Mot “Death” (spelled mt) is personified as a god of death. The word is cognate with forms meaning “death” in other Semitic languages: with Hebrew (“moth” or “maveth”); with Caraanite, Egyptian Aramaic, Nabatean, and Palmyrene (“mut”); with Jewish Aramaic, Christian Palestinian Aramaic, and Samaritan (“mut”); with Syriac “maat”?; With Mandaean “muta”; with Akkadian “m’tu”; with Arabic “maut”; with Ge’ez “mot”. Although Semitic languages aren’t closely related to Indo-European languages, the words for “death” in Sanskrit (“mrit”) and Latin (“mortus”) are similar.</p>

    <p>Mot (Death), son of ’El, according to instructions given by the god Hadad (Ba’al) to his messengers, lives in hmry (Mirey), a pit is his throne, and Filth is the land of his heritage. But Ba’al warns them:</p>
  </div>

  <div class="cita cursiva">
    <p>that you not come near to divine Death,</p>

    <p>lest me made you like a lamb in his mouth,</p>

    <p>(and) you both be carried away like a kid in the</p>

    <p>breach of his windpipe.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="mano">
    <p>Hadad seems to be urging that Mot come to his feast and submit himself to Hadad.</p>

    <p>Death sends back a message that his appetite is that of lions in the wilderness, like the longing of dolphins in the sea, and he threatens to devour Ba’al himself. In a subsequent passage Death seemingly makes good his threat, or at least is deceived into believing he has slain Ba’al. Numerous gaps in the text makes this portion of the tale obscure. Then Ba’al/Hadad’s sister, the warrior goddess ’Anat, comes upon Mot, seizes him, splits him with a blade, winnows him in sieve, burns him in a fire, grinds him between millstones, and throws what remains on the field for the birds to devour.</p>

    <div class="imgizq"><img alt src="Images/img044.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>But after seven years Death returns, seeking vengeance for the splitting, burning, grinding, and winnowing, and demanding one of Ba’al’s brothers to feed upon. A gap in the text is followed by Mot complaining that Ba’al has given Mot his own brothers to eat, the sons of his mother to consume. A single combat between the two breaks out until Shapsh (Sun) upgraids Mot, informing him that his own father ’El will turn against him and overturn his throne if he continues. Mot concedes and the conflict ends. In <span class="subrayado">Sanchuniathon</span> also Death is son of ’El and counted as a god, as the text says in speaking of ’El/Cronus:</p>
  </div>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">… and not long afterward he consecrated after his death another of his sons, called Muth, whom he had by Rhea; this (Muth) the Phoenicians esteem the same as Thanatos [“Death”] and Pluto.</p>

  <p class="mano asangre">But earlier in a philosophical creation myth <span class="subrayado">Sanchuniathon</span> has referred to great wind which merged with its parents and that connection was called Eros (Desire):</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img045.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p class="cita cursiva">From its connection Mot was produced, which some say is mud, and others a putrescence of water compound; and out of this came every germ of creation, and the generation of the universe. So there were certain animals which had no sensation, and out of them grew intelligent animals which were called “Zophasemin,” that is “observers of heaven”; and they were formed like the shape of an egg. Also Mot bust forth into light, and sun, and moon, and stars, and the great constellations.</p>

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="asangre">The language here is confusing, a bad summary and possibly corrupt, and the form “Mot” here is not the same as “Muth,” which appears later. But it may be that the full and coherent account would have made clear that muddy and putrescent Death is the source of life.</p>

  <p>But he’s not going to read it tonight, because here we are, Christmas night, and there’s two hundred miles of scrub prairie and desert between me and them. No Christmas tree, no carrots and milk for Santa and the reindeer. A couple of days ago I handed them presents, and they gave me a set of night-vision goggles that Dean must have pinched from a gun show we passed through in Amarillo a couple of months ago. They’re growing up without me. And they’re both starting to act out a little, because we’re apart so much. Sam gets resentful and has some trouble handling his temper. Dean tries to fix everything and keep us together as a team. Neither of them should have to do those things.</p>

  <p>And how do I avoid this question: Would the boys be better off somewhere else, with someone else, living normal lives?</p>

  <p>No. I’m their father. They belong with me.</p>

    <p class="asangre">Procopius, <span class="normal">Secret History</span>, on Justinian:</p>

    <p>And some of those who have been with Justinian at the palace at night, men who were pure in spirit, have thought they saw a strange demoniac form taking his place. One man said that the Emperor suddenly rose from his throne and walked about, and indeed he was never wont to remain sitting for long, and immediately Justinian’s head vanished, while the rest of his body seemed to ebb and flow; whereat the beholder stood aghast and fearful, wondering if his eyes were deceiving him. But presently he perceived the vanished head filling out and joining the body again as strangely as it had left it.</p>

    <p>Another said he stood beside the Emperor as he sat, and all of a sudden the face changed into a shapeless mass of flesh, with neither eyebrows nor eyes in their proper places, nor any other distinguishing feature; and after a time the natural appearance of his countenance returned. I write these instances not as one who saw them myself, but heard them from men who were positive they had seen these strange occurrences at the time.</p>

    <p>They also say that a certain monk, very dear to God, at the instance of those who dwelt with him in the desert went to Constantinople to beg for mercy to his neighbors who had been outraged beyond endurance. And when he arrived there, he forthwith secured an audience with the Emperor; but just as he was about to enter his apartment, he stopped short as his feet were on the threshold, and suddenly stepped backward. Whereupon the eunuch escorting him, and others who were present, importuned him to go ahead. But he answered not a word; and like a man who has had a stroke staggered back to his lodging. And when some followed to ask why he acted thus, they say he distinctly declared he saw the King of the Devils sitting on the throne in the palace, and he did not care to meet or ask any favor of him.</p>

  <p class="asangre">This list is beings that can change their shape at will, or who undergo recurrent changes.</p>

  <div class="mano asangre salto10">
    <p>WEREWOLF (loup-garou, rougarou, oboroten, vrykolakas, pricolici, maj-coh): Change caused by full moon, or isolation, or brought on by recitation of a spell. Too many variations, and I’ve never seen one. Never met anyone who has, either. Needs some separate research. Lycaon?</p>

    <p>VAMPIRE - ask Elkins</p>

    <p>KITSUNE: Japanese fox spirit, has as many as nine trails to signify its age and wisdom. Can be tricksters, lvoers, messengers of Inary. Myobu designates kitsune associated with Inari (kami of rice, color white); nogitsune are the variety that are untamed, tricksterish, dangerous. After livint 1000 years, kitsune acquires its ninth tail along with the ability to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. They hate dogs, and the presence of a dog sometimes makes them revert when they have assumed human form. Often change appearance to beatiful women, encountered alone. They will take human lovers, and bear children, but vanish again when their true nature is discovered. Also can appear in dreams. Kitsunetsuki is the term for possession by a kitsune, which causes the sufferer to behave like a fox and speak strange languages. Exorcism must take place in a shrine to Inari. Kitsune often carry round balls alight with kitsune-bi, foxfire. A human who gets one of these balls has leverage over the kitsune. As tricksters, kitsune often target pride and greed, taking people down a peg. Sometimes they’re just malevolent, but this is rare. More likely to find them in abandoned houses, where they will resist new residents. Korean version known as kumiho, Chinese huli jing. Kumiho generally are evil, eating either human hearts or livers in an effort to consume human essence and become human themselves; less common variant stories have the kumiho becoming human by resisting its urge to kill for a thousand days. Huli jing more ambivalent, like kitsune. Emphasis in Chinese tales on possession and seduction.</p>

    <p>TANUKI. Japanese “raccoon dog,” can assume any shape and often takes on the appearance of inanimate objects —teakettles, etc.— to play a trick on humans. Largely good-humored, but can turn dangerous as well known for the size of their testicles. Very fond of alcohol, and like to play games with merchants by cheating them using disguised leaves as money.</p>

    <p>BOUDA: East African were-hyena, from name of the tribe where the power originated. Handed down matrilineally, power also related to more general witchcraft. (Witchcraft in Africa often related to blacksmiths… interesting. Think of Ogun and the Colt…). Parallel were-hyena legends is of the qora. Ethiopian Jews often accused of being bouda. Also numerous legends in Ethiopia and Sudan that white —or albino— people had hyena blood, or could transform into hyenas.</p>

    <p>WERE-JAGUAR. (runa-uturungu in Argentina, also yaguarte-aba; chacmool in Mexico?)</p>

    <p>SELKIE: Said to be souls of drowned people now inhabiting bodies of seals. Shed their seal skins to come ashore at prescribed intervals, or when they fall in love. If a human captures the selkie is in his (or, less often, her) power. Selkies live human lives, have human children… until they discover where their skin has been hidden. Then they seize it and return to the ocean. Some selkies are out to avenge hunting of seals —they are said to curse and sabotage fishermen. Tales come from across the North Atlantic, some similar stories in Pacific Northwest. Related stories of swan-maiden (swanmay, dove-girl, peacock maiden), various other animal-wife tales.</p>

    <p>LESZY: Slavic woodland spirit, protector of forests and natural world. Tall men, with beards of grass and vines. Can assume any form, including plants and trees. Known to appear as a giant talking mushroom, and to keep company with wolves and bears. When in human form, his eyes glow green and his shoes are on the wrong feet. Will enter pacts with peasants or farmers, keeping their cattle or sheep from getting lost, but will also react violently to any perceived threat. Hides axes, leads lumberjacks astray, destroys signs, kidnaps young women, even known to tickle people to death. Leszy can be repelled by wearing clothes inside out or by starting a fire in their forests. Unusual among shape-shifting beings because it has a family: leszachka, wife, and leshonky, children.</p>

    <p>NAGA: Common to Indian and Buddhist myth, nagas are snake spirits. Sometimes take human form to live among humans. More often they live in bodies of water or underground, where they guard treasure. Nagas have influence over natural events, and are offered sacrifices. Worshipped across south and southwest Asia, from India to Tibet to Cambodia and all the way to Malaysia.</p>

    <p>RAKSHASA: Reincarnated from evil human beings. Rakshasas are powerful shape-changers who may not have a native form. They also have magical powers, including invisibility. They are cannibalistic, and particularly target anything religious or holy. In addition to human flesh, they will eat spoiled food. Their fingernails are poisonous. In the <span class="subrayado">Mahabharata</span>, some rakshasas who give up cannibalism eventually become allies of humans.</p>

    <p>YUXA: In Tatar folklore, a snake who reaches 100 years of age becomes a yuxa, and will assure the appearance of a young woman to have children, who then become more yuxa.</p>

    <p>TENGU: Spirits of the arrogant or vains, tengu appear as old men or birds. Sometimes they attack those who are the most like they were in life —typically overly proud samurai, priests, nobles. More broadly, they deceive travelers, kidnap children, and lead priests astray. Often their victims are found tied to the tops of trees, sometimes insane. They have strong powers of illusion, and will possess young women in an attempt to seduce priests and monks away from their vows. If the tengus identity is guessed or discovered, it has to assume its true form —a large bird, like a kite— and it will flee. Sometimes it can be propitiated with sacrifices. Usually in these cases a tengu has chosen a place to guard or make its home, and intruders who don’t observe the proper rites are in for trouble.</p>

    <p>PUCA: May appear as a variety of animals, always dark in color. Most often a horse who will give unexpecting humans a wild ride. Can speak and if it takes a liking to a person, it will give him advice —especially on November 1. Crops left in the fields after this date are considered to belong to it, as it is always hungry. If not fed, its temperament can turn more dangerous.</p>

    <p>EACH UISGE: Usually a horse, can be a young man. As a human, tries to seduce young women. As horse, it carries its rider into the water before eating the rider, leaving only the liver. If kept away from water, it can be controlled.</p>

    <p>ENCANTADOS: Group of beings from Brazilian lore. Can be snakes or disembodied spirits, but typically used to describe dolphins who can assure human form. Encantados come from another world, have magical abilities related to music and seduction. Like Celtic faeries, they sometimes kidnap children, especially progeny of their human liaisons —but no changeling stories. Encantados are known to drive people mad, but rarely kill outright. Will sometimes force a transmutation of a human into following the encantado to its realm, known as Encante. In human form, they wear hats to cover their blowholes, which do no disappear in the transformation. A magical powder composed of manioc andh chile, scattered over the water where the encantado appeared, is said to break their spell.</p>

    <p>And some of those who have been with Justinian at the palace at night, men who were pure in spirit, have thought they saw a strange demoniac form taking his place. One man said that the Emperor suddenly rose from his throne and walked about, and indeed he was never wont to remain sitting for long, and immediately Justinian’s head vanished, while the rest of his body seemed to ebb and flow; whereat the beholder stood aghast and fearful, wondering if his eyes were deceiving him. But presently he perceived the vanished head filling out and joining the body again as strangely as it had left it.</p>

    <p>Another said he stood beside the Emperor as he sat, and all of a sudden the face changed into a shapeless mass of flesh, with neither eyebrows nor eyes in their proper places, nor any other distinguishing feature; and after a time the natural appearance of his countenance returned. I write these instances not as one who saw them myself, but heard them from men who were positive they had seen these strange occurrences at the time.</p>

    <p>They also say that a certain monk, very dear to God, at the instance of those who dwelt with him in the desert went to Constantinople to beg for mercy to his neighbors who had been outraged beyond endurance. And when he arrived there, he forthwith secured an audience with the Emperor; but just as he was about to enter his apartment, he stopped short as his feet were on the threshold, and suddenly stepped backward. Whereupon the eunuch escorting him, and others who were present, importuned him to go ahead. But he answered not a word; and like a man who has had a stroke staggered back to his lodging. And when some followed to ask why he acted thus, they say he distinctly declared he saw the King of the Devils sitting on the throne in the palace, and he did not care to meet or ask any favor of him.</p>

  <p class="asangre">This list is beings that can change their shape at will, or who undergo recurrent changes.</p>

  <div class="mano asangre salto10">
    <p>WEREWOLF (loup-garou, rougarou, oboroten, vrykolakas, pricolici, maj-coh): Change caused by full moon, or isolation, or brought on by recitation of a spell. Too many variations, and I’ve never seen one. Never met anyone who has, either. Needs some separate research. Lycaon?</p>

    <p>VAMPIRE - ask Elkins</p>

    <p>KITSUNE: Japanese fox spirit, has as many as nine trails to signify its age and wisdom. Can be tricksters, lvoers, messengers of Inary. Myobu designates kitsune associated with Inari (kami of rice, color white); nogitsune are the variety that are untamed, tricksterish, dangerous. After livint 1000 years, kitsune acquires its ninth tail along with the ability to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. They hate dogs, and the presence of a dog sometimes makes them revert when they have assumed human form. Often change appearance to beatiful women, encountered alone. They will take human lovers, and bear children, but vanish again when their true nature is discovered. Also can appear in dreams. Kitsunetsuki is the term for possession by a kitsune, which causes the sufferer to behave like a fox and speak strange languages. Exorcism must take place in a shrine to Inari. Kitsune often carry round balls alight with kitsune-bi, foxfire. A human who gets one of these balls has leverage over the kitsune. As tricksters, kitsune often target pride and greed, taking people down a peg. Sometimes they’re just malevolent, but this is rare. More likely to find them in abandoned houses, where they will resist new residents. Korean version known as kumiho, Chinese huli jing. Kumiho generally are evil, eating either human hearts or livers in an effort to consume human essence and become human themselves; less common variant stories have the kumiho becoming human by resisting its urge to kill for a thousand days. Huli jing more ambivalent, like kitsune. Emphasis in Chinese tales on possession and seduction.</p>

    <p>TANUKI. Japanese “raccoon dog,” can assume any shape and often takes on the appearance of inanimate objects —teakettles, etc.— to play a trick on humans. Largely good-humored, but can turn dangerous as well known for the size of their testicles. Very fond of alcohol, and like to play games with merchants by cheating them using disguised leaves as money.</p>

    <p>BOUDA: East African were-hyena, from name of the tribe where the power originated. Handed down matrilineally, power also related to more general witchcraft. (Witchcraft in Africa often related to blacksmiths… interesting. Think of Ogun and the Colt…). Parallel were-hyena legends is of the qora. Ethiopian Jews often accused of being bouda. Also numerous legends in Ethiopia and Sudan that white —or albino— people had hyena blood, or could transform into hyenas.</p>

    <p>WERE-JAGUAR. (runa-uturungu in Argentina, also yaguarte-aba; chacmool in Mexico?)</p>

    <p>SELKIE: Said to be souls of drowned people now inhabiting bodies of seals. Shed their seal skins to come ashore at prescribed intervals, or when they fall in love. If a human captures the selkie is in his (or, less often, her) power. Selkies live human lives, have human children… until they discover where their skin has been hidden. Then they seize it and return to the ocean. Some selkies are out to avenge hunting of seals —they are said to curse and sabotage fishermen. Tales come from across the North Atlantic, some similar stories in Pacific Northwest. Related stories of swan-maiden (swanmay, dove-girl, peacock maiden), various other animal-wife tales.</p>

    <p>LESZY: Slavic woodland spirit, protector of forests and natural world. Tall men, with beards of grass and vines. Can assume any form, including plants and trees. Known to appear as a giant talking mushroom, and to keep company with wolves and bears. When in human form, his eyes glow green and his shoes are on the wrong feet. Will enter pacts with peasants or farmers, keeping their cattle or sheep from getting lost, but will also react violently to any perceived threat. Hides axes, leads lumberjacks astray, destroys signs, kidnaps young women, even known to tickle people to death. Leszy can be repelled by wearing clothes inside out or by starting a fire in their forests. Unusual among shape-shifting beings because it has a family: leszachka, wife, and leshonky, children.</p>

    <p>NAGA: Common to Indian and Buddhist myth, nagas are snake spirits. Sometimes take human form to live among humans. More often they live in bodies of water or underground, where they guard treasure. Nagas have influence over natural events, and are offered sacrifices. Worshipped across south and southwest Asia, from India to Tibet to Cambodia and all the way to Malaysia.</p>

    <p>RAKSHASA: Reincarnated from evil human beings. Rakshasas are powerful shape-changers who may not have a native form. They also have magical powers, including invisibility. They are cannibalistic, and particularly target anything religious or holy. In addition to human flesh, they will eat spoiled food. Their fingernails are poisonous. In the <span class="subrayado">Mahabharata</span>, some rakshasas who give up cannibalism eventually become allies of humans.</p>

    <p>YUXA: In Tatar folklore, a snake who reaches 100 years of age becomes a yuxa, and will assure the appearance of a young woman to have children, who then become more yuxa.</p>

    <p>TENGU: Spirits of the arrogant or vains, tengu appear as old men or birds. Sometimes they attack those who are the most like they were in life —typically overly proud samurai, priests, nobles. More broadly, they deceive travelers, kidnap children, and lead priests astray. Often their victims are found tied to the tops of trees, sometimes insane. They have strong powers of illusion, and will possess young women in an attempt to seduce priests and monks away from their vows. If the tengus identity is guessed or discovered, it has to assume its true form —a large bird, like a kite— and it will flee. Sometimes it can be propitiated with sacrifices. Usually in these cases a tengu has chosen a place to guard or make its home, and intruders who don’t observe the proper rites are in for trouble.</p>

    <p>PUCA: May appear as a variety of animals, always dark in color. Most often a horse who will give unexpecting humans a wild ride. Can speak and if it takes a liking to a person, it will give him advice —especially on November 1. Crops left in the fields after this date are considered to belong to it, as it is always hungry. If not fed, its temperament can turn more dangerous.</p>

    <p>EACH UISGE: Usually a horse, can be a young man. As a human, tries to seduce young women. As horse, it carries its rider into the water before eating the rider, leaving only the liver. If kept away from water, it can be controlled.</p>

    <p>ENCANTADOS: Group of beings from Brazilian lore. Can be snakes or disembodied spirits, but typically used to describe dolphins who can assure human form. Encantados come from another world, have magical abilities related to music and seduction. Like Celtic faeries, they sometimes kidnap children, especially progeny of their human liaisons —but no changeling stories. Encantados are known to drive people mad, but rarely kill outright. Will sometimes force a transmutation of a human into following the encantado to its realm, known as Encante. In human form, they wear hats to cover their blowholes, which do no disappear in the transformation. A magical powder composed of manioc andh chile, scattered over the water where the encantado appeared, is said to break their spell.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Dean turns fifteen today. A week ago he helped me take out a spirit haunting a grocery owned by an Indian family in Erie, Pennsylvania. It was like any other spirit —you find the remains, you salt, you burn. But also it wasn’t. I’m learning that all spirits have some things in common, but it matters who they’re haunting. It matters what their traditions were when they were alive. Have been reading about Indian mythology. Gods upon gods, thousand of them, and each of them has attendant monsters and demons. Some of the ones that keep popping up, not so much mythology as folklore, are pishacha and acheri.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img054.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Pishacha eat human flesh and are supposed to be the sons of anger. They haunt cemeteries and places where cremations have taken place. They can change their shape, and in some stories they can also become invisible. Sometimes they attack and eat their victims, other times they possess them and drive them insane. I’m reminded of the unnamed demon in the <em>Testament of Solomon</em> who creeps “beside the men who pass along among the tombs, and in untimely season I assume the form of the dead; and if I catch any one, I at once destroy him with my sword. But if I cannot destroy him, I cause him to be possessed with a demon.”</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img055.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Acheri is a demon that disguises itself as a little girl. From Indian folk tradition. Acheri are said to inhabit the mountains and murder travelers who are taken by its helpless guise. A protection against them is to wear a red thread around the neck (this was also said to protect small children against sorcery in some European countries).</p>

  <p>Red thread: Kabbalah? According to the rabbis, there’s no mention in the Torah or Talmud about red strings, also no mention in written Kabbalah. But an old folk superstition states that tying a red string around the body is a segulah, a protective act. Some Orthodox Jews tie red strings on the cribs of infants to ward off evil spirits or the evil eye. Scholarly Jewish tradition considers the red string a superstition that veers dangerously close to impiety, even idol-worship.</p>

  <p>Sefer Yetzirah: Everything derived from the Word, the creation of language, from which comes every aspect of physical world. Seven pairs of contrasts:</p>

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">There were formed seven double letters, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Pe, Resh, Tau, each has two voices, either aspirated or softened. These are the foundations of Life, Peace, Riches, Beauty or Reputation, Wisdom, Fruitfulness, and power. These are double, because their opposites take part in life; opposed to Life is Death; to Peace, War; to Riches, Poverty; to Beauty or Reputations, Deformity or Disrepute; to Wisdon, Ignorance; to Fruitfulness, Sterility; to Power, Slavery.</p>

  <p>No good, no evil. The way a man lives his life in relationship to natural and divine order dictates whether he will perceive good or evil.</p>

  <p>Tree of Life described in Sefer Yetzirah, but more in Zohar —belief among esoteric theologians that it corresponds with Tree of Life mentioned in Genesis. Two versions. One has 10 Sephirot, 22 connections; the other 11 and 24. Individual characteristics of Sephirot and pathways hotly contested.</p>

  <p>Above the first Sephirah, Keter, is the Ayn Sot Aur, the beginning point that no mind can comprehend but that we need to grant so that there can be a beginning point. With Keter, Binah, Chakhmah, time and space begin. These are the Crown, Wisdom, and Understanding —rest of creation comes from these.</p>

  <p>Tetragammaton arranged in different ways can be tetraktys, as in Pythagorean mysticism. From tetraktys, quincunx was derived.

I’m not sure I understand what he’s talking about, but according to Sammy, everything you could ever want to know is on the Internet somewhere, and if you have a computer you can find it. Looks like Team Winchester just took a big leap ahead when it comes to gathering information. Every army needs intelligence.

    <p class="salto05 derecha subrayado">—A Dialogue of Witches and Witchcraft</p>

    <p>Nahuales: Shamans who acquire the power to shape-shift. Name is Nahuatl (Aztec, originally nahualli in the plural). Stories span Aztec, Maya mythologies and descendants —Mixtec, Zapotec, Tzeltal, so on. Each nahual has a tonal, animal aspect related to the day of the nahual’s birth. The nahual can assume this shape, but often others as well. Some nahual have vampiric qualities, changing into bats or owls to drain blood; in other cases the nahual is a respected and feared member of a community, relied on to settle disputes. In some places nahuales are said to attack Indians who have too much contact with mestizo or Anglo populations. Montezuma’s advisor Necahualcoyotl said to be able to change shape, possibly escaped Cortez this way? Tradition persists parallel to brujeria, which has parallels in both European-style witchcraft and shamanism.</p>

    <p>North America- Mohawk limikkin, “skinwalkers.” Navajo version is yenaldooshi, who break a taboo to acquire magical powers. This taboo generally said to be murdering a relative. Once this is done, the yenaldooshi can change shape, although he goes in human form in ordinary circumstances. He will wear a coyote skin. <img alt class="imgdch" src="Images/img058.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload>The yenaldooshi attacks in two ways: it srpinkles a toxic powder made from corpses, which causes lingering and ultimately fatal sickness, and it uses a blowgun to shoot a small pellet of bone into the victim’s body. This also causes a sickness that will eventually kill the victim. Yenaldooshi known to move through settlements at night, desecrating religious places.</p>

    <p>Africa - Hausa witches I was telling Jim about a couple of years back. Can change into dogs.</p>

    <p>Possibly related to Abraxas, or Abrasax. Collin de Plancy: “A god in certain Asian theogonies. From his name is derived the magical word Abracadabra. He is represented on amulets as having the head of a cock, the feet of a dragon, and a whip in his hand. Demonologists have made him a demon with the head of a king and with serpents for his legs. The Egyptian Basilides, 2nd century heretics, looked upon him as their supreme god. Finding that the seven Greek letters contained in his name amounted to 365, the number of days in the year, they placed at his command several spirits who presided over the 365 heavens and to whom they attributed 365 virtues, one for each day. <img alt class="imgdch" src="Images/img059.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload>The Basilides also said that Jesus Christ, Our Savior, was but a benevolent spirit sent to earth by Abrasax.” —<span class="subrayado">Dictionnaire inferna</span>, 1863</p>

    <p>Basilides a Gnostic sect. Other sources deny connection with Basilides, suggest Abraxas/Abrasax is a demiurgic figure syncretized from Jewish and other obscure tradition.</p>

    <p>Cree: Evil that devours. Half phantom, half man, half beast. Wood spirit, very thing. Cannibal/magic. Eats live flesh. Lives in forests.</p>

    <p>Perfect hunter: heightened senses, speed, strength, power. Enhanced vision, smell. Cunning and insane. Not bound by moral restrictions nor conventional restraints. With superhuman abilities, lives by instincts as an animal. Ferocious, ravenous, evil. Strength of wild animal, freedom to roam forest, hunt for live meat. Eats only living flesh.</p>
  </div>

  <p class="salto10 asangre">Wendigo knows how to fast long winters —hibernates for years at a time— will hunt when necessary. Legends from local lore state that it’s hundreds of years old —was once a man, and turned into cannibal, possibly from conditions such as harsh winters cut off from supplies. Miner/hunter/courier DeBois: conditions of isolation &amp; depravity turned him into a monster. Different cultures around the world carry similar legends. Cannibalism endows the consumer with certain powers such as heightened senses, strength, speed, agility.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img062.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Desperate, lonely —what price survival? Eats members of his own tribe. Always hungry, alone, numb. Less than human. Can never return, senses gone in normal sense. Wendigos are feared in history —petroglyphs are clear depictions— North American versions: gigantic spirit, over fifteen feet tall, glowing eyes, long yellow fangs, overly long tongue, most have yellowish swallow skin. Some are matted with hair, lanky, and driven by hunger. Can be male or female, but always hungry. Some versions of the legend have them growing in size with every meal, so there’s always more to feed. Others say wendigo has a heart of ice which must be shattered or melted to kill it.</p>

  <p>Cannibalism plus magic equals a dark, dark road. I’ve never seen anything so hungry. Every motion and sound and breath of the wendigo is about hunger. It’s stealthy when stalking is prey, blinding fast when pouncing, savage and ravenous when eating.</p>

  <p>I wish I didn’t know about that last part, but you see things in this job.</p>

And they do dispose themselves as very wolves, in worrying and killing, and most of humane creatures.” Verstegan hints that the werewolf has no conscious memory of its actions while it is transformed —“to their own thinking.” Other accounts, not Verstegan’s, have this hand-in-hand with a belief that werewolves can only transform while they are asleep.</p>

  <p>Werewolves will avoid wolfsbane when they can, as well as holy artifacts and silver. Being stabbed or cut with a silver knife can sometimes force a werewolf to revert to human shape. The silver bullet legend is probably true, but not all hunters believe in it. You hear grumbles around the gathering places. I was at the roadhouse not too long ago and heard three hunters complaining that either they’d done something wrong when they made their silver bullets, or that some werewolves just weren’t affected.</p>

    <p><span class="capital">M</span>y master had gone to Capua to sell some old clothes. I seized the opportunity, and persuaded our guest to bear me company about five miles out of town; for he was a soldier, and as bold as death. We set out about cockcrow, and the moon shone bright as day, when, coming among some monuments, my man began to converse with the stars, whilst I jogged along singing and counting them. Presently I looked back after him, and saw him strip and lay his clothes by the side of the road. My heart was in my mouth in an instant, I stood like a corpse; when, in a crack, he was turned into a wolf. Don’t think I’m joking: I would not tell you a lie for the finest fortune in the world.</p>

    <p>But to continue: after he was turned into a wolf, he set up a howl and made straight for the woods. At first I did not know whether I was on my head or my heels; but at last going to take up his clothes, I fond them turned into stone. The sweat streamed from me, and I never expected to get over it. Melissa began to wonder why I walked so late. “Had you come a little sooner,” she said, “you might at least have lent us a hand; for a wolf broke into the farm and has butchered all our cattle; but though he got off, it was no laughing matter for him, for a servant of ours ran him through with a pike. Hearing this I could not close an eye; but as soon as it was daylight, I ran home like a pedlar that has been eased of his pack. Coming to the place where the clothes had been turned into stone, I saw nothing but a pool of blood; and when I got home, I found my soldier lying in bed, like an ox in a stall, and a surgeon dressing his neck. I saw at once that he was a fellow who could change his skin, and never after could I eat bread with him, no, not if you would have killed me. Those who would have taken a different view of the case are welcome to their opinion; if I tell you a lie, may you genii confound me!</p>

    <p class="salto05 asangre">New world versions. Loup-garou known in Canada and places where French settled in U.S. Loup-garou legends from precolonial Illinois: after the initial transformation, a loup-garou was doomed to spend 101 days of nightly transformations, followed by days of melancholia and sickness. The only way to get out of the sentence early was if someone managed to draw blood from the loup-garou, and in this case, neither party involved could ever speak of the incident until the remainder of the 101 days had passed.</p>

    <p>Variation called rougarou known in southern U.S. —in some versions said to be a crocodile after transformation, rather than a wolf. Crocodile transformations also known in Egypt and Indonesia. Often New World versions are said to become werewolves because of some broken taboo. Cannibalism? One of the earliest werewolf legends is the story of Lycaon, transformed into a wolf after eating human flesh and trying to serve it to Zeus. Herodotus and Pliny also told of people turned into wolves. In the Bible, Nebuchadnezzar said to imagine himself as a wolf.</p>

    <p>Throwing a piece of iron over a transformed werewolf is said to force it back into its human shape. Related to belief that faeries can’t touch iron?</p>

    <p>8. And Saul disguised himself, and put on other rainment, and he went, and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, I pray thee, divine unto me by the familiar spirit, and bring me him up, whom I shall name unto thee.</p>

    <p>8. And the woman said unto him, Behold, thou knowest what Saul hath done, how he hath cut off those that have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: wherefore then layest thou a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</p>

    <p>10.And Saul sware to her by the LORD, saying, As the LORD liveth, there shall no punishment happen to thee for this thing.</p>

    <p>11.Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up unto thee? And he said, Bring me up Samuel.</p>

    <p>12.And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice: and the woman spake to Saul, saying, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.</p>

    <p>13.And the king said unto her, Be not afraid: for what sawest thou? And the woman said unto Saul, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.</p>

    <p>14.And he said unto her, What form is he of? And she said, An old woman cometh up; and he is covered with a mantle. And Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he stopped with his face to the ground, and bowed himself.</p>

    <p>15.And Samuel said to Saul, Why hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up? And Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I shall do.</p>

    <p class="asangre salto10">THE MAGUS, FRANCIS BARRETT</p>

    <p class="asangre"><span class="capital">H</span>ence it is that the souls of the dead are not to be called up without blood or by the application of some part of their relict body. In the raising therefore of these shadows, we are to perfume with new blood the bones of the dead, and with flesh, eggs, milk, honey, and oil, which furnish the soul with a medium apt to receive its body.</p>

    <p>It is likewise to be understood, those who are desirous to raise any souls of the dead, ought to select those places wherein these kind of souls are most known to be conversant; or by some alliance alluring the souls into their forsaken bodies, or by some kind of affection in times past impressed in them in their life, drawing the souls to certain places, things, or persons; or by the forcible nature of some place fitted and prepared to purge or punish these souls: which places for the most part are to be known by the appearance of visions, nightly incursions, and apparitions.</p>

    <p>Therefore the places most fitting for these things are church-yards. And better than them are those places devoted to the executions of criminal judgements; and better than these are those places where, of late years, there have been so great and so many public slaughters of men; and that place is still better than those where some dead carcass that came by violent death is not yet expiated, nor was lately buried; for the expiation of those places is likewise a holy rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the bodies, and often prohibits the soul returning to its body, and expels the same afar off to the place of judgement.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Dean turns seventeen today. We went shooting. Then I sent him out on his first hunt. I’ve let him take the lead before, but I’ve always been there to back him up. This time he’s on his own. Partly it’s a test, and partly I wanted some time with Sammy. Should be no problem for Dean. Ghosts of two nuns haunting St. Stephen’s Indian Mission in Riverton, Wyoming. Simple salt-and-burn mission. Nuns in love with each other, then discovered. Killed themselves. We scoped the situation out, figured that something must be left behind that’s now a focus for the haunting. Bible, rosary beads, some small article that’s hidden somewhere in their room. I figured Dean would take care of it no problem, but I still stayed close by with Sammy.</p>

  <p>The boys are old enough now that we can start spending a little more time in one place. Thinking California, maybe. When I need to fly solo, they’re big enough to stay home by themselves for a while without me worrying. When we go on a hunt together, they can bring their homework. That’s what I wanted to talk to Sammy about. It’s going to be hard enough getting his bullheaded self through adolescence without also having to fight every other day about how he wants to be Jimmy Normal. We can make this work if we do it together —but he’s going to have to know that everyone pulls their weight. Mary comes first.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img068.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

What worries me is that he’s got so much bottled up inside him that when it comes out, he won’t be able to control it. I think that’s part of why he has the dreams. He’s different, my Sammy. I think he’s a little haunted by being in the room with Mary when she was killed. He feels like he should remember something, or be able to offer a clue. God, it must be terrible to know you witnessed something but that you’ll never be able to remember it or tell anyone about it. I think he also wonders about Ms. Lyle.

Also remember Ms. Lyle.</p>

  <p>Life is about remembering the dead and making sure you protect the living.</p>

  <p>Met an alchemist who believes that the souls of the dead can be pinned into homunculi. Offered to do this for me and Mary. I turned him down, but it wasn’t easy. Spirits that can’t go on turn bad, and I couldn’t stand to see that happen to her. I’ve seen it happen to too many other people who were loved.</p>

  <h2 class="subtit" title="November 14"><span id="november-14">November 14:</span><a href="#november-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2>

  <p class="asangre">Got this one from one Emil Besetzny, who published a book in 1873 about homunculi created by John Ferdinand, Count of Kuffstein (if there wasn’t a place called Kuffstein, someone would have to make it up), in about 1775. Besetzny’s sources were apparentluy Masonic manuscripts and the journal of the count’s butler, who went by the name of Kammerer. The count’s collaborating alchemist was a Rosicrucian monk by the name of Abbé Geloni.</p>

  <div class="cita cursiva">
    <p class="asangre">The bottles were closed with ox-bladders, and with a great magic seal (Solomon’s seal?). The spirits swam about in those bottles, and were about one span long. …They were therefore buried under two cartloads of horse manure, and the pile daily sprinkled with a certain liquor, prepared with great trouble by the two adepts, and made our of some “very disgusting materials.” …After the bottles were removed, the “spirits” had grown to be each one about one and a half span long, so that the bottles were almost too small to contain them, and the male homunculi had come into possession of heavy beards, and the nails of their fingers and toes had grown a great deal… In the bottle of the red and in that of the blue spirit, however, there was nothing to be seen but “clear water”; but whenever the Abbé knocked three times at the seal upon the mouth of the bottles, speaking at the same time some Hebrew words, the water in the bottle began to turn blue (respectively, red), and the blue and the red spirits would show their faces, first very small, but growing in proportions until they attained the size of an ordinary human face. The face of the blue spirit was beautiful, like an angel, but the face of the red one bore a horrible expression.</p>

    <p>Once every week the water had to be removed, and the bottles filled again with pure rainwater. This change had to be accomplished very rapidly, because during the few moments that the spirits were exposed to the air they closed their eyes, and seemed to become weak and unconscious, as if they were about to die. But the blue spirit was never fed, nor was the water changed; while the red one received once a week a thimbleful of fresh blood of some animal (chicken), and this blood disappeared in the water as soon as it was poured into it…</p>

    <p>… the spirits gave prophecies about future events that usually proved to be correct. They knew the most secret things, but each of them was only acquainted with such things as belonged to his station; for instance, the king could talk politics, the monk about religion, the miner about minerals &amp; etc.; but the red and blue spirits seemed to know about everything.</p>

    <p>By some accident the glass containing the monk fell one day upon the floor and was broken. The poor monk died after a few painful respirations, in spite of all the efforts of the count to save his life, and his body was buried in the garden. An attempt to generate another one, made by the count without the assistance of the Abbé, who had left, resulted in a failure, as it produced only a small thing like a leech, which had very little vitality and soon died.</p>
  </div>

  <p>And about golems: Most golems can’t speak. Idea is that if granted speech, they would have soul, and that an imperfect creation (created by man rather than God) would have an imperfect soul and be dangerous.</p>

  <div class="cursiva cita asangre">
    <p>Sanhedrin 65b:</p>

    <p>Rava stated: If they wish, Tzadikkim could create a world. Rava created a man and he sent it to Rabi Zeira. Rabi Zeira spoke with it and it did not respond. Rabi Zeira then stated, “You are created by my coleague, return to your dust.” Rav Chanina and Rav Oshiah would sit every Friday and study the Sefer Yetzirah and create a calf that has reached a third of its potential development and subsequently eat it.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Eleazar of Worms mentions golems in commentary on Sefer Yetzirah:</p>

  <div class="cursiva cita">
    <p class="asangre">Whoever studies Sefer Yetzirah has to purify himself, don white robes. It is forbidden to study alone, but only in two’s and three’s, as it is written, …and the beings they made in Haran (Gen. 12:5), and as it is written, two are better than one (Eccl. 4:9), and as it is written, it is not good for man to be alone; I will make a fitting helper for him (Gen. 2:18). For this reason Scripture begins with a “bet” —“Bereshit bara,” He created.</p>
  </div>

  <p>To control the golem, the creator writes one of the names of God on its forehead, or on a tablet under its tongue. This can then be erased or removed. Or the creator could write the word Emet (<span class="hebreo">ajx</span> “truth”) on its forehead. By erasing the first letter in Emet to form Met (<span class="hebreo">jx</span> “dead”) the creator would destroy the golem.</p>

  <p>According to Kabbalah, a golem can never disobey its creator.</p>

    <p>Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan, laid out by August Brevoort Woodward. Magician, esoteric, Freemason. Both plans executed after fires: Detroit, 1805, Ypsilanti, 1825?</p>

    <p>More lore picked up around the Wolverine State:</p>

    <p>SNAKE GODDESS OF BELLE ISLE. Legend of Detroit-area Indians, from the Ottawwa Princess hidden in a covered canoe by the chief, her father. Her suitor discovers her and takes her to his wigwam, angering the winds, who beat him to death. Spirits help the chief hide her on Belle Isle, protecting her with snakes. She is sometimes seen as a white deer. The spirit of her unlucky lover is stuck on Peche Island. First European settlers in the area called Belle Isle Rattlesnake Island. Frequent sightings of a woman in a white gown (Woman in White) as well as white deer.</p>

    <p>MAIN ROUGE. Legend come from Normandy, where the dwarf was a fisherman’s helper —though sometimes a trickster too. In Detroit, the dwarf is dangerous. It is sometimes naked, sometimes wearing a ratty fur coat or fur boots. Has black hair, reddish skin, burning eyes, appears and disappears at will. Every appearance portends disaster for whoever sees it, and for the city. Appearances:</p>

    <p>1701: Cadillac attacks it with a sword. Shortly after, he is financially ruined and his reputation wrecked. Forced to leave Detroit, goes first to New Orleans and then back to France.</p>

    <p>1763: British soldiers see dwarf before the Battle of Bloody Run, where they are slaughtered by Pontiac.</p>

    <p>1805: Dwarf seen immediately before the fire that destroys the city. Woodward then plans the rebuilding. Sightings in the smithy where the fire began.</p>

    <p>1812: General Hull reports a dwarf attacking out of the fog after his failed attempt to cross the river and invade Canada. Surrenders the city to the British not knowing that he outnumbers them. Later court-martialed and sentenced to the firing squad. Sentence commuted.</p>

    <p>1967: Multiple sightings of the dwarf before riots that start on 12th street. Much of the city burns, riot accelerates decline of the area.</p>

    <p>1976: Power-line workers see dwarf before ice storm.</p>

    <p>Less reliable sightings in 1884, 1964.</p>

  <p class="asangre">I gave Dean the Impala today for his eighteenth birthday. The car is 30 years old now, amazing it runs as well as it does. I’ve taught Dean a lot of what I know about working on cars, which was everything until 1983. Haven’t kept up since then, all the computers and emissions spaghetti drives me nuts. Give me a fat 327, no electronics, just pistons, crankshaft, and a gas pedal. That’s a car. And now it’s my son’s. He knows I’ll still be driving it, but he’s a man now, and since he’s already made his share of kills, this was the only rite of passage I could think of. He goddam well better take care of it.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Exorcism for an area or community. Takes the form of a prayer to St. Michael the Archangel, which is kind of ironic because there’s no such a thing as angels. Ask any hunter. Demons, now those are real. So when you call out to an angel that doesn’t exist, what are you really calling out to? I don’t know if I would trust this one.</p>

  <div class="cita cursiva">
    <p class="asangre">St. Michael the Archangel, illustrious leader of the heavenly army, defend us in the battle against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of darkness and the spirit of wickedness in high places. Come to the rescue of mankind, whom God has made in His own image and likeness, and purchased from Satan’s tyranny at so great a price. Holy Church venerates you as her patron and guardian. The Lord has entrusted to you the task of leading the souls of the redeemed to heavenly blessedness. Entreat the Lord of peace to cast Satan down under our feet, so as to keep him from further holding man captive and doing harm to the Church. Carry our prayers up to God’s throne, that the mercy of the Lord may quickly come and lay hold of the beast, the serpent of old, Satan and his demons, casting him in chains into the abyss, so that he can no longer seduce the nations.</p>

    <p>We cast you out, every unclean spirit, every satanic power, every onslaught of the infernal adversary, every legion, every diabolical group and sect, in the name and by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ. We commando you, begone and fly far from the Church of God, from the souls made by God in His image and redeemed by the precious blood of the divine Lamb. No longer dare, cunning serpent, to deceive the human race, to persecute God’s Church, to strike God’s elect and to sift them as wheat. For the Most High God commands you, He to whom you once proudly presumed yourself equal; He who wills all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of truth. God the Father commands you. God the Son commands you. God the Holy Spirit commands you. Christ, the eternal Word of God made flesh, commands you, who humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, to save our race from the perdition wrought by your envy; who founded His Church upon a firm rock, declaring that the gates of hell should never prevail against her, and that He would remain with her all days, even to the end of the world. The sacred mystery of the cross commands you, along with the power of all mysteries of Christian faith. The exalted Virgin Mary, Mother of God, commands you, who in her lowliness crushed your proud head from the first moment of her Immaculate Conception. The faith of the holy apostles Peter and Paul and the other apostles commands you. The blood of martyrs and the devout prayers of all holy men and women commands you.</p>

    <p>Therefore, accursed dragon and every diabolical legion, we adjure you by the living God, by the true God, by the holy God, by God, who so loved the world that He gave His only-begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him might not perish but have everlasting life; to cease deluding human creatures and filling them with the poison of everlasting damnation; to desist from harming the Church and hampering her freedom. Begone, Satan, father and master of lies, enemy of man’s welfare. Give place to Christ, in whom you found none of your works. Give way to the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church, which Christ Himself purchased with His blood. Bow down before God’s mighty hand, tremble and flee as we call on the holy and awesome name of Jesus, before whom the denizens of hell cower, to whom the heavenly Virtues and Powers and Dominations are subject, whom the Cherubim and Seraphim praise with unending cries as they sing: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth.</p>

  <p class="asangre mano">Four classes of demons in Judeo-Christian demonology, corresponding to cardinal directions and four elements. Also four seasons.</p>

  <p class="cita asangre cursiva">Waite, <span class="normal">The Occult Sciences</span>: “Much that passed current in the west as White (i.e. permissible) Magic was only a disguised goeticism, and many of the resplendent angels invoked with divine rites reveal their cloven hoofs. It is not too much to say that a large majority of past psychological experiments were conducted to establish communication with demons, and that for unlawful purposes. The popular conceptions concerning the diabolical spheres, which have been all accredited by magic, may have been gross exagerations of fact concerning rudimentary and perverse intelligences, but the wilful viciousness of the communicants is substantially untouched thereby.”</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is fourteen years old today. He’s been having strange dreams again. I’ve tried to keep an eye out for any signs that he’s more than a regular kid, but I don’t see them. He’s sensitive, has a lot of imagination, but that’s about it. Plus now that he’s hitting adolescence, he’s a giant pain in the ass. Dean just chased girls and snuck around with beers in his coat pockets. That was teenage trouble I could understand. But Sammy just shuts down sometimes. Won’t talk to anyone, and when he does, it’s only because he wants to argue about something. He’s got all the willpower us Winchesters are known for, but in him it sits quietly. You don’t notice it’s there until he decides he feels strongly enough about something that he won’t compromise. Then you might as well wrestle angels.</p>

    <p class="centrado negrita">SAMUEL COLT</p>

    <p class="asangre">1814-1862. Born and died in Hartford, CT. One of seven children. Various revolver designs, first submitted for patent 1832? Same year Colt went on missionary trip to Calcutta.</p>

    <p class="salto10">The Colt: Made in 1835 for a hunter, during the appearance of Halley’s Comet that year-perihelion November 16, Struve observations from August 20-November 16. Would have been visible from other parts of Earth for several weeks after. Colt created during this period (?). Descriptions of it make it sound like a Paterson, but it must be different somehow —Paterson fired cap-and-ball, and if Colt made 13 bullets —supposed to be numbered— they must be cartridges. Metal cartridges not introduced into Colts until 1873? Some retrofitted before that. A bullet fired from it will kill anything, even beings that normally don’t die from bullets or any kind of physical damage. Everyone you talk to has a different story about how the Colt has been used. Nobody living has ever seen it, as far as I know. Standard manufacture of Paterson ran from 1836-1842 —discontinued after that when company failed, although Colt’s creditors sold Paterson models until 1847.</p>

    <p>1835 Colt the first of its kind? Prototype, the Ur-Colt. Progenitor of all revolvers that followed. Not the first time a blacksmith or metalworker has tinkered with the occult. African orisha Ogun, god of iron, fire, war. Throughout western Africa, blacksmiths regarded as priests and magicians. Abyssinian/Ethiopian and Congo traditions hold that blacksmiths are magicians. Dactyls, Corybantes, Cabiri, Curetes, other ancient peoples considered magicians because of their prowess in ironworking, blacksmithing. Norse myth the same —Wieland, tale of Thord Vettir. German tradition that the blacksmith ends his work on Saturday by striking his anvil, chaining the Devil for another week. Blacksmiths also said to recognize gods and devils. In parts of the Slavic countries, oaths can be sworn on an anvil. From India and Scotland, stories that disease and demonic possession can be cures by the touch of an anvil or water from a smithy.</p>

    <p class="salto10">December 1, 1835. The date works, and it’s the feast of St. Eloy, or Eligius, who is patron saint of blacksmiths and farriers. Eligius known for sending his servants and monks throughout Southern France to take down the bodies of executed criminals and bury them full rites —precaution against revenants?</p>

    <p class="salto10">Micah Jenkins born-Confederate general, killed by own men at wilderness 5/6/64</p>

    <p>Hans Christina Andersen publishes first book of fairy tales</p>

    <p>Jacob Rome is born-Ohio congressman, mayor of Toledo</p>

    <p class="salto10">Could hunter have been David Crockett or Jim Bowie? Both explorers, both died at Alamo. Every story I hear about the Colt has something to do with the Alamo, but the siege didn’t happen until 1836… Crockett left for Texas on Halloween 1835. Halley’s Comet would have been visible. Bowie already there, on December 1 he was searching for legendary Los Almagres mine.</p>

I haven’t talked to him about it, but he must know it’s going to happen. Couple of times I’ve tried to talk to school administrators about double-promoting him, but then they want to see test scores, gifted enrollments, that kind of thing. I don’t have any of that.

  <p class="cita cursiva asangre">On an island in the sea stands an inviolate grove, in which, veiled with a cloth, is a chariot that none but the priest may touch. The priest can feel the presence of the goddess in this holy of holies, and attends her with deepest reverence as her chariot is drawn along by cows. Then follow days of rejoicing and merry-making in every place that she condescends to visit and sojourn in. No one goes to war, no one takes up arms; every iron object is locked away… After that, the chariot, the vestments, and (believe it if you will) the goddess herself, are cleansed in a secluded lake. This service is performed by slaves who are immediately afterward drowned in the lake. (Germania)</p>

    <p>The miller agreed, and the drunkard said, “Find a boy for us. We will bury him alive beneath the foundation stone, and I guarantee the durability of the spillway.”</p>

  <p>Death is the separation of the soul from the body. The creation of a zombie is the rebinding of body and soul via necromancy. The animated body can move, speak, even think, but it still can’t outrun physical decay. Zombies don’t last very long, and the more able they are to think, the more they suffer from the same derangement that eventually gets any spirit that’s been prevented from moving on.

Mercury also god of magicians, derived from Hermes. (Hermes Trimegistus, hermetic) Statues of Mercury and Hermes set at crossroads.</p>

    <p>John the Conqueror root —form of morning glory, represents power of mythical African trickster sold into slavery.</p>

It’s a little easier with Sammy lately. He seems more committed. Maybe that’s because he’s able to have more control over being in school, having a friend here and there. I try not to tell him what I really think, which is that he’s shirking sometimes. Winchesters don’t quit. I don’t think he’s quitting, but he gets stubborn, and then he won’t listen to anything I say. He and Dean don’t get along as well as they used to. Could be Sammy’s getting tired of being the little brother, and always having Dean take the lead.</p>

  <p>Could be it’s time for Sammy to go out on his first solo. I should look around for something simple, like I did for Dean. Don’t know why I’m so worried, really. Sammy’s never hesitated when push came to shove.</p>

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="asangre">Banshee. Bean sidhe. Sometimes they are dressed in white, sometimes in a winding sheet or burial gown. They wail, they scream, sometimes they sing to signal that death approaches for some member of the household where they are heard. Usually they come in one of three forms, which correspond to the three stages of womanhood (and maybe have something to do with the age of the person whose death is being signaled). A banshee is either a beautiful young woman, a matron, or a corpselike hag. As a hag, she has a link, way back, with notorious English hag figures such as Black Annis, a one-eyed crone, physically strong and with the features of a demon: long teeth, iron claws, and a blue face. She was said to hide in a giant oak that was the sole survivor of the primeval forest. Like many hag figures, she was a cannibal who preferred children, which she ate after laying them alive. Their skins hung in a cave beneath the tree. (Link here to the Greek, Lamia, a demonic/monstrous figure, often half-serpent, who eats children.)</p>

    <p>Baba Yaga, from Russian lore, is another example. Living deep in the forest, in a magical hut that moved around on chicken legs, she often ate children, but unlike Black Annis, Baba Yaga could be an important source of magical help for a hero or questing child. If you asked her the right kind of question, or caught her in the right mood, she might help you on your errand instead of making a meal of you.</p>

    <p>The banshee often appeared crying as she washed bloody clothes by a river —usually the clothes of someone about to die. Also, she can appear as a crow, rabbit, or weasel.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Figure I would try to put together a sort of Revenant 101. The lore is all over the place, so probably some experimenting is needed to settle on best tactics. The European sources say revenants, including vampires, may be destroyed by:</p>

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="salto10 asangre">Staking. Ash or oak most effective. Rom traditions use hawthorn. Generally stakes are driven into the heart, but sometimes the mouth or stomach. Wooden stakes employed sometimes to destroy the revenant, sometimes to pin it in the coffin. Corpse can be staked through the legs to keep it from getting out. Variation on staking: use metal pins or needles —piercing heart, eyes, or feet. Sharp metal objects buried with corpse keep it in place, often a sickle. Pieces of steel or iron placed in the mouth.</p>

    <p>Burning. Corpse suspected of being a dormant revenant exhumed and burned. Sometimes only the heart must be burned. Some traditions burn the body and mix the ashes with water or holy water. Surviving relatives drink the mixture, releasing the curse.</p>

    <p>Dismembered or decapitated. Heart cut out, or head severed and placed between the feet. Head sometimes buried in a separate location, or burned. 1892, Mercy Brown, Rhode Island. Father thought she was a vampire, dug her up, burned her heart.</p>

    <p>Exorcism. Performed when the body is believed to be possessed instead of revenant.</p>

    <p>New world vampires: tunda, soucouyant, patasola, peuchen, cihuateteo (sunlight fatal), asema (becomes ball of light like African obayifo), lobishomen (unleashes women’s sexual drive)</p>

    <p>Asia: jiangshi, bhuta, prêt, bramarakshasa, mandurugo/penanggalan (succubus qualities), pontianak/langsuir (died in childbirth like Aztec mocihuaquetzqui), leyak, aswang, manananggal (preys on pregnant women), nukekubi, chural (feet backwards like leszy?) kappa (lives in water, noted for etiquette but drains life force)</p>

    <p>Africa: ramanga, adze (changes into firefly), asasabosam, impundulu</p>

    <p>Europe: callicantzaros (born between Christmas and Epiphany, can only attack on those days), upis (two hearts), ustrel (born on Saturday, died unbaptized)</p>

    <p>Australia: yama-yha-who. Victims gradually transformed into the creature by its feeding on them, or if it ate them whole and then vomited them back up</p>

I’ve thrown everything away for this, to join an underground tribe of hunters and spend my nights watching exorcisms and killing spirits… and what have I done to the boys? They don’t have friends, not the way I did. I lived in the same town the whole time I was growing up. Now they’re almost grown, and they’ve seen every back road and abandoned farmhouse in the country, but they don’t have roots. We’ve never been back to Lawrence.</p>

  <p>Wonder how may exorcisms I’ve seen. Maybe fifty, sixty? How many of them were real demons, and how many were some other kind of prankster spirit? Anything can call itself a demon. I’ve smelled the sulfur, though. I’ve seen the holy water and the Devil’s Traps work. The whole thing might be easier if the demons weren’t so cagey about the Big Guy down there. If they’ve never seen him, and most of them don’t believe he exists, then hey, there’s no fallen angels ruling over Hell. So no angels, period. And then what are demons? And what is Hell?

  <div class="mano">
    <p class="salto10 asangre">Dybbuk. A malicious possessing spirit/soul of someone recently dead. Escaped from or prevented entry into the afterlife (especially in the case of suicide). Derived from the Hebrew word meaning “attachment” —dybbuk, possesses a living person, usually to finish task that it was prevented from performing in life. Drawn to people who have unfulfilled desires to do something, possibly something unethical or wrong is more attractive to the spirit. Possession makes the person more likely to do the things he’s been preventing himself from doing, and dybbuk can be drawn to a person who wants the same things it wanted in life. If the dybbuk is allowed to finish, or helped along its way, it will depart when the goal is accomplished. Dybbuks described in Samuel 18:10 and Book of Kings when Elijah is possessed by a spirit trying to get Saul to start an unjust war.</p>

    <p>Jewish exorcism involving Psalm 91 and the blowing of a ram’s horn to shatter the walls surrounding the dybbuk. Commentaries on the psalm emphasize the safety of the righteous man in the face of surprise dangers. Hebrew commentaries suggest that pestilence and destruction are poetic names for demons, one coming by night and the other at noon.</p>

    <p>Jinn. From Semitic root meaning hidden. Pre-Islamic Arabian myth said they were the spirits of vanished peoples who brought disease and insanity at night. Also said to be spirits of five who could change shape. Advent of Islam changed their character. Koran says they were created of smokeless fire. Particular varieties may or may not be identified with ordinal directions or elements; ifrit, marid, etc. All can be bound through ritual or if they can be overpowered. In hadith, elements of shape-changing remain, and an ifrit attakcs Muhammad with a firebolt.</p>

    <p>4 He shall cover thee with His feathers, and under His wings shalt thou trust: His truth shall be thy shield and buckler.</p>

    <p>5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;</p>

    <p>6 nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</p>

    <p>7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.</p>

    <p>8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</p>

    <p>9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the Most High, thy habitation;</p>

    <p>10 there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</p>

    <p>11 For He shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</p>

    <p>12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</p>

    <p>13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</p>

    <p>14 Because He hath set His love upon me, therefore will I deliver Him: I will set Him on high, because He hath known my name.</p>

    <p>15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer Him: I will be with Him in trouble; I will deliver Him, and honor Him.</p>

    <p>16 With long life will I satisfy Him, and show Him my salvation.</p>

  <p class="cita asangre">Koran, sura 72, al-Jinn:</p>

  <p class="cita asangre cursiva">Say (O Muhammad): It is revealed unto me that a company of the Jinn gave ear, and they said: Lo! we have heard a marvellous Koran, which guideth unto righteousness, so we believe in it and we ascribe no partner unto our Lord. And (we believe) that He —exalted be the glory of our Lord!— hath taken neither wife nor son, And that the foolish one among us used to speak concerning Allah an atrocious lie. And lo! we had supposed that humankind and jinn would not speak a lie concerning Allah —and indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt against Alla; And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise anyone (from the dead). And (the Jinn who had listened to the Koran said): We had sought the heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors. And we used to sit on places (high) therein to listen. But he who listeneth now findeth a flame in wait for him; and we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them. And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that. We are sects having different rules. And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we escape by flight. And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth in his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression. And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah) and there are among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have taken the right path purposefully. And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell.</p>

I tried to raise him right, and looks like I did. He’s a scam artist, a ladies’ man, and an absolutely loyal son. He knows what’s right and doesn’t hesitate to do it. I’m proud of him. Now that he’s hunting on his own I don’t see as much of him, but I know he’s out there. When I call him in on a job, he’s right there every time. I’ve spent the last sixteen years afraid that I was going to screw him up somehow. Maybe now I can forget about that.</p>

    <p>GHOUL. From Arabian/Persian legends, dwells in graveyards or uninhabited places. Ghul literally means demon, but the ghoul doesn’t behave in the way Judeo-Christian demons do. Sired by Iblis (primary devil of Islam, a jinn who rebelled against Allah and was allowed to roam the earth to test people by putting bad ideas in their heads). Also the name for a desert-dwelling shape-shifting demon, often seen as a hyena. Lures travelers into the desert to eat them, also kidnaps children. Ghouls rob and desecrate graves, eat the dead.</p>

    <p>VETALA. Vampiric spirit from Hindu myth which animates corpses, haunts cemeteries, causes miscarriages. Can tell the future and reveal hidden secrets if captured. Destroyed by the performing of a proper funeral.</p>

    <p>DRAUGR. Icelandic/Viking legend, undead beings who are enormously strong and can grow or shrink in size. Escaped the grave by turning into smoke. Unclear whether any of the dead person’s personality survived in the draugr. Draugr can’t be hurt by regular weapons, must be wrestled back into their graves. <img alt class="imgdch" src="Images/img110.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload>Final disposal methods recall vampire-killing instructions: decapitate, burn, and scatter the ashes in the sea. Some draugr (haugbui) stayed at their graves. Others sometimes marauded through settlements. Related to the draug, a Nordic sea-ghost and death omen. Spirit —sometimes corporeal— of drowned sailor. One variant, the gleip, causes bad luck —makes sailors slip on wet rocks. Draug can also change their appearance to look like stones. Sometimes in this form they are taken aboard ships as ballast, and when they reassume their natural form they capsize the ship. As death omen, draug are said to scream like banshee, and sometimes they are only seen by the man who is about to die.</p>

    <p>Also from Scandinavia, the myling or utburd (meaning something cast out) spirits or incarnations of children who died before being baptized, or were murdered. Leap on the backs of travelers at night, wanting to be buried in hallowed ground. Myling grows heavier the closer it gets to the graveyard, pressing its carrier down into the earth. Myling kills those who cannot complete this task.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sammy is eighteen years old today. Surprised he didn’t take off. We’re not getting along too well. He hunts when we need him to, but he’s never committed himself the way Dean did. Dean’s never known any other way to live, or if he has, he doesn’t act like it. He’s playing the role he was born to play. Sammy’s the younger brother. He doesn’t know what his role is, even though I can tell him until I’m blue in the face and we’re both ready to kill each other. He’s got one more year of school and them I’m drafting him full-time into the family business. I’ve given him more slack than I ever gave Dean, more than I would have ever gotten from my dad. He needed it. Now he’s a grown man, or almost. Time for him to step into what’s expected of him. Dean never even thought about college. We used to joke about it once in a while. But Sammy still believes he can have a normal life, but they’re both more useful to the world as hunters than… what, lawyers? Dentists? Sammy’s convinced himself that smart kids have to go to college. Part of my job is to convince him that college would be a waste of his smarts. And I gotta hand it to him on the brains front: there’s nothing he can’t find on the computer. I still dig around in actual books, libraries, newspapers. It’s all keystrokes and search words for Sammy. He’s done a good job hiding our trail on all the credit cards.</p>

  <p class="asangre">This would have been our twenty-third anniversary. Now the new century is really here, and I’m still on the hunt. Getting closer? Bobby threw me this curveball the other day:</p>

  <p>Admitting that demons exist might not be the same as believing in demons —esp. since the demons don’t even believe. Even if they aren’t demons, if they think they are —if they’re some kind of spirit that believes itself a demon— then they’re going to act like demons are supposed to act.</p>

  <p>In other words, even if demons aren’t real, as long as there are malevolent spirits that think they’re demons and act like demons, they’ll need to be fought like demons. Kind of a spin on the thoughtform, created from belief…?</p>

  <p>Sounds too complicated to me. Either there are demons or there aren’t.</p>

Barely. Trying to work out what to do about this. We can’t tolerate any of us quitting. We’re better as a team. I’ve protected Sammy his whole life, and so has Dean. Could be I’ve gone too easy on him. Dean always responded to discipline because he believed in the mission. I thought that by giving Sammy more room, I’d let him find his own way to dedication like Dean’s. Doesn’t look like that worked out.

Younger Avesta opposes them to the gods of light? Named daevas: Angra, Mainyu (later Ahriman), Sarva, Indra, Nanghaithya, Tauru, Zairi, Nasu. Also another demon, Paitisha. Daevas vulnerable to fire, and drawn to the physical processes of the human body. Also they are attracted by speaking during meals. Tradition in medieval Zoroastrianism discouraged eating after dark, since daevas were out then. Book of Arda Wiraz describes them spreading across the Earth at nightfall, causing destruction —both personal and on a larger scale. Daevas sometimes blame for natural disasters that happened at night. Occasionally they are given incubus-like properties. About three dozen daevas named in Zian texts, and more referred to.</p>

There are people here who speak of a “phantom attacker.” Is Hibbing a possible hunting ground? Why are there so many missing from here? Some of these date back generations. I have spoken to a few of the locals, there are rumors about a dark figure who comes out at night, takes a victim, and vanishes. No trace of victims. Some people hear unusual sounds close to the place the victims have disappeared. Is this just a local legend or some kind of phantom? (Like Springheel Jack, phantom gassers, etc.?)</p>

  <p class="salto10">A few people here will talk but no one seems to know anything. You can tell they are scared. The police have nothing to go on. Talked to an officer who said all those cases are unsolved. There is absolutely no evidence, and no bodies have ever been found. This is likely a phantom attacker of some kind, I am almost certain. The local folklore is similar to Springheel Jack, for example. In London, he terrorized people starting in 1837… strange sightings of a cloaked figure that breathed blue-white fire. It targeted women mostly. Never solved and is still a mystery. Other legends of this type include Nain Rouge, Mothman, and phantom gassers. There are definitely similarities to this Hibbing area phantom.</p>

I can’t stand the idea of the boys separated. It’s one thing for me to take a stand. I’m the father, I have to lay down the law for the family. Maybe that’s the Marine in me talking, and maybe it’s not the right thing to do all the time, but it’s gotten us this far. Now I’m questioning myself. Brothers have to stick together.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Sam’s twentieth birthday. He’s in California. Dean and I are packing up to get the hell out of Athens, Ohio, which as of this morning is free and clear of haunted sorority houses. I heard Dean talking about Sam on the phone earlier, but he didn’t say anything about the conversation to me. I can’t bring it up to Dean, either, especially not the mood he’s been in. Usually after a hunt he’s on fire, like the killing is a buzz. Today you can’t talk to him. If I didn’t know better, I’d think it was because of a girl, but we’ve only been here a couple of weeks. It’s not like Dean to fall hard for a girl that fast. He was spending a lot of time with a reporter —think she was a reporter. A looker. Could be anything, though. Hard to tell how he’s reacting to Sam going AWOL. Dean’s like me. He doesn’t talk. He acts. We act.</p>

  <p class="asangre">US Route 491 dedicated today. Formerly Route 666, The Devil’s Highway. A Navajo medicine man did a ceremony to remove the curse. What do the Navajo care about the Number of the Beast? I’m going to have to go down there again and see. Wonder if the black dogs will give up on the road now. Were they thoughtforms all along, conjured up by all the people who made the connection between the number and the Devil? Was it the name of the road? Or were they real?</p>

  <p class="asangre">In Kittanning, Pennsylvania. Poltergeist in a playground built on an old cemetery. Of all the stupid places to put a playground. Sixth or seventh time I’ve dealt with a poltergeist, enough to know that the psychokinetic theory about girls and puberty is a load of crap. Usually I don’t do this, but I’ve kind of gotten friendly with one of the locals, Jerry Panowski. One of his kids has been targeted a couple of times. For some reason he’s easy to talk to. Most of the civilians you meet either don’t want to know about the supernatural or blame you for bringing it into their lives once you tell them about it. Jerry’s not like that. He understands, I think. Maybe he understands better than I do. Still feel conflicted about Sam. I don’t think I did the wrong thing, but I also don’t want him out there alone and vulnerable. I’ve been through Palo Alto half a dozen times in the past year, just to make sure he’s okay. I look around, see if there’s any sign of anything happening that shouldn’t be. He’s my son. I can’t abandon him. But I also can’t go back on what I said. You don’t stop loving a kid, but you also can’t let love blind you to what’s right.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Reading around about Samhain, and came across a creature called a puca. It seems to be a distant cousin of the Wild Hunt (also source of the character of Puck?). Quebec version, chasse-galerie, where an unlucky lumberjack gets taken for a ride with the devil on a haunted canoe. Wild Hunt riders recruit accidental viewers to join them, and some can never leave. Often there’s a warning not to leave until a certain event has occurred, and the new rider alights to find that centuries have passed. (Typical of visits to the lands of fairies, where time doesn’t pass at the same rate… see also kitsune stories from Japan.)</p>

  <p>Perhaps puca takes riders through time…? To the underworld? Puca said to be able to answer questions, especially on November 1. Would like to know more. Creatures with this kind of ability have <em>answers</em>, and <em>answers</em> are what I need.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Mary has been dead for twenty years. Spent the anniversary at the Winchester Mystery House. After some looking around, I found a distant family connection. Some great-great-uncle, parallel descent. Genealogy isn’t my strong suit. House built after Sarah Winchester got advice from a medium after her husband and daughter died. Medium said the family was haunted because Winchester guns had killed so many people. Sarah had to build a house to distract and trap the spirits, and keep building in 1882, didn’t stop until she died in 1922. Construction was around the clock. House built up to seven stories as of 1906, partially collapsed in the earthquake. Now four stories. Approximately 160 rooms, no one is quite sure. Stairs lead nowhere, doors open onto nothing, hallways wind around into dead ends, secret passages are everywhere. No blueprint or complete plan exists. Sarah would tell the workmen what she wanted done from day to day, sketching partial floor plans on napkins or pieces of paper. Some of those survive.</p>

  <p>Number 13 is everywhere. 13 palm trees in front of the house, wall hooks are set in rows of 13, stained-glass window custom from Tiffany with 13 stones. Chandeliers to fit 13 candles. Spiderweb motif —she thought it was lucky. From story of Saint Felix (lucky)?</p>

  <p>525 South Winchester Boulevard. Multiple of 5. 25 times 21. Interesting numbers in there. Sarah chose the address for a reason. Fives are strong, and 21 (3×7) powerful in numerology. Plus the number adds up to 12, and it’s symmetrical.</p>

  <div class="imgdch"><img alt src="Images/img130.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

  <p>Spotted a valknut, redone as crescent moons. Old Viking symbol related to Odin’s powers over the mind, became a symbol of the Trinity in medieval Europe. Also invokes moon symbolism.</p>

  <p>This Winchester saga is an interesting flip side to the story of the Colt. Wonder if Samuel Colt was haunted.</p>

  <p class="asangre">This would have been our twenty-sixth anniversary. Two days ago, like some awful kind of early present, I got a call from Bobby. It was a long conversation, and by the end of it, I was a confirmed believer in demons, because after twenty-one years, we might just have a real lead on what happened to Mary. All the things I’ve seen, and I wrote them off to other kinds of phenomena… <em>Goddamnit</em>. I should have been listening all this time. How much closer would I be? Years of lost time to make up for. For a while I thought it might have been Lilith, but now I know better.</p>

    <p class="asangre">Sibly: The form and nature of spirits, say they, are to be considered according to the force to which each caterva doth belong; for some, being altogether of a divine and celestial nature, are not subject to the abominable conjurations and enchantments of vicious men; whilst others, of a diabolical and infernal nature, are not only ready upon all occasions to become subservient to exorcists and magicians, but are ever watching opportunities of exciting evil afflections in the mind, and of stirring up the wickedly inclined to the commission of every species of inquity and vice.</p>

    <p>Thus by the instigation of infernal spirits, and their own promptitude, they often terrify men with nocturnal visions; provoke melancholy people to suicide; tempt drunkards and incendiaries to set houses on fire, to burn those who are in them, and allure careless servants and others to sound and incautious sleep; that such unlucky accidents might happen besides innumerable other ways they have of executing the devices of iniquitous spirits through malicious instigations, or secret stratagems, projected for the overthrow and destruction of mortal men; especially when the work to be effected by the devil is too hard for his subtle and spiritual nature to effect, because the same belongs to the outward source or principle to which these dubious spirits more immediately belong.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Amon. Seventh of the ranking spirits of Hell. “Appeareth like a wolf with a serpent’s tail, vomiting out of his mouth flames of fire.” Nothing about him in Testament of Solomon.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img131.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Aim. Twenty-third spirit. Three heads, riding a snake and “carrying a Firebrand in his Hand, werewith he setteth cities, castles, and great Places, on fire.”</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img132.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Asmoday. Thrity-second spirit. “Sitteth upon an Infernal Dragon,” and breathes fire. In Testament of Solomon, he say he can’t be forced to tell the truth: “But how shall I answer thee, for thou art a son of man; whereas I was born an angel’s seed by a daughter of man, so that no word of our heavenly kind addressed to the earth-born can be overweening.” Hates water. According to Weyer, the conjuror’s ring can force him to tell the truth.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img133.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Amy/Avnas. Fifty-eighth spirit, “appeareth at first in the form of a Flaming Fire.” Will take human shape, and disclose secrets and treasures guarded by spirits. Grants familiars.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img134.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Haures/Flauros. Sixty-fourth spirit. “He putteth on a human shape with Eyes Flaming and Fiery… He destroyeth and burneth up those who be the Enemies of the Exorcist should he so desire it.” But also a skilled deceiver if he’s not kept within the boundaries of the trap. Will talk of heaven and hell, and of the Fall.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img135.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Marchosias. A wolf with griffin’s wings, breathes fire, will take human shape. Gives true answers.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img136.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

    <p>Balam. Three heads, burning eyes, rides a bear. Can make things invisible. “Of the order of dominations,” according to Weyer.</p>

    <div class="ilustra"><img alt src="Images/img137.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload></div>

The first time I met the guy, he showed me Mary’s spirit and it turned itself into the guise of a hellhound. Since then, the things we’ve seen… Why should anything I see or hear from Jim spook me after that? Don’t know. When I hung up the phone, I felt like… not like someone had walked over my grave, but like I’d just walked over his. I asked him if he was okay, he said he’d never been better.

If Bileth the king be more stubborne, and refuse to enter into the circle at the first call, and the conjuror shew himself fearfull, or if he have not the chaine of spirits, certeinelie he will never feare nor regard him after. Also, if the place be unapt for a triangle to be made without the circle, then set there a boll of wine, and the exorcist shall certeinlie knowe when he commeth out of his house, with his fellowes, and that the foresaid Bileth will be his helper, his friend, and obedient unto him when he commeth foorth. And when he commeth, let the exorcist receive him courteouslie, and glorifie him in his pride, and therfore he shall adore him as other kings doo, bicause he saith nothing without other princes. <img alt class="imgdch" src="Images/img140.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload>Also, if he be cited by an exorcist, alwaies a silver ring of the middle finger of the left hand must be held against the exorcist face.</p>

  <p class="asangre">Bingo. California, New Jersey, Arizona. House fires. In each case, a mother killed and one of the survivors a six-month-old baby. Need to go back and see if there were others on 11/2/83. Either way, this is a hard lead. Looking at locations, survivors, other associated phenomena. Unusual weather, spikes in violence or crime. Any of those things can signify demonic involvement. But the fires are enough. Six of them, within a couple of days, each with a six-month-old involved. You gave yourself away, you bastard.</p>

  <p>Almost twenty-two years I’ve been after you. It’s not going to be twenty-three. I’m going to look into your yellow eyes and watch you die.</p>

  <p>I want to tell the boys, but won’t just yet. Dean might go off half-cocked, and Sammy… I was about to write that he wouldn’t care. Maybe that’s not true. But he might not care enough, and I don’t think I could stand knowing that.</p>

    <p class="centrado negrita">La Llorona</p>

    <p class="asangre">Long ago, the story goes, a beautiful Indian princess, Dona Luisa de Loveros, fell in love with a handsome Mexican nobleman, named Don Nuno de Montesclaros. The princess loved the nobleman deeply and had two children by him, but Montesclaros refused to marry her. When he finally deserted her and married another woman, Dona Luisa went mad with rage and stabbed her two children. Authorities found her wandering the street, sobbing, her clothes covered in blood. They charged her with infanticide and sent her to the gallows.</p>

    <p>Ever since, it is said, the ghost of La Llorona walks the country at night in her bloody dress, crying out for her murdered children. If she finds any child, she’s likely to carry it away with her to the nether regions, where her own spirit dwells.</p>

      <p>Woman in White legends all over the world. Often related to vanishing hitchhiker.</p>

      <p>List of recorded Vanishing Hitchhiker incidents: Ya-ta-Hey NM (along 666!); Chicago —Resurrection Mary, Greensboro NC; Buffton IN; along Hwy 365 in Arkansas; Delmar NY; St. Louis; White Rock Lake TX; Tompkinsville KY; Toronto; Spartanburg SC; Berkeley CA; Los Angeles; San Francisco; Clinton Road NJ… older stories from all over the world. Korea, China, Japan, Russia, Slovakia, other European countries. Mormon tradition of Nephites.</p>

      <p>Interesting variation: Lauderdale, AL, the ghost of a jazz musician in a white zoot suit. If you give him a ride, he will talk about his trumpet before disappearing. Local story is that he was killed while on his way to Florence.</p>

      <p>Vanishing hitchhikers often prophesy or tell drivers some secret. Stories like this were especially common in World War II, and in pre-automotive Europe. Related to the myth of the Wandering Jew. Matthew 16:28. Jesus says that some of his witnesses will not die until the Second Coming. Later said to be a shoemaker Cartaphilus, who spurred Jesus along the Via Dolorosa; or Pontius Pilat’s footman; Longinus, the Roman soldier who stabbed Jesus with a spear; the servant Malchus, whose ear St. Peter cut off. Goes all the way back to Cain, condemned to wander because of his crime. Later Gypsies said to be descended from the blacksmith who forged the nails for the cross. Various combinations of these stories exist. What they have in common is the theme that as penance, the wanderer must go from place to place testifying about the Second Coming and his own error. Occasionally a female, sometimes Herodias, who laughed at Jesus before the Crucifixion Wandering Jew appears and disappears without warning.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Always dangerous, because it preys on one of the best human qualities, the impulse to help those in need. The problem with the vanishing hitchhiker is that it never stays vanished. It leaves a token sometimes, which leads the person who offered the ride to try to find it again. Usually that search leads straight to a graveyard, and there’s one less Good Samaritan in the world. Some spirits know they can’t approach directly, and some just love the game of taking advantage of the better sides of human nature.</p>

  <p class="mano salto10 asangre">Azazel: first mentioned as the intended recipient of a scapegoat cast out on Yom Kippur. Leviticus 16:8. Name connotes strength, impudence —cognates have been translated as variants of Angel of Death. Book of Enoch says Azazel was one of the fallen angesl who fathered the Nephilim of human women. Enoch also claims Azazel was the first to show men how to make metal weapons and armor. (Also cosmetics, so blame him for that too.) “To him ascribe all sin.” Conflict here with the stories of Enoch himself given in the Book of the Watchers. Enoch himself supposed to be an angel descending, to give gifts of knowledge and science. Azazel always associated with goats. Also sometimes with the Lilim.</p>

  <div class="sinopsis">
    <p>Sam and Dean Winchester know all the secrets their father recorded in his journal. Now you can, too.</p>

    <p>On November 2, 1983, Sam and Dean Winchester lost their mother to a demonic supernatural force. In the wake of the tragedy, their father, John, set out to learn everything he could about the paranormal evil that lives in the dark corners and on the back roads of America… and how to kill it. In his personal journal, he not only compiled folklore, legend and superstition about all manner of otherworldly enemies but he also recorded his experiences —hunting the creature that killed his wife even as he raised his two sons.</p>

    <p>Part prequel, part resource guide, <em>John Winchester’s Journal</em> finally gives fans the ultimate companion book for <em>Supernatural</em>. It’s all here: the exorcism Sam and Dean used in “Phantom Traveler,” John’s notes on everything from shapeshifters to Samuel Colt, Dean’s first hunt, Sam’s peewee soccer team… and John’s single-minded pursuit of a growing and deadly evil.</p>
