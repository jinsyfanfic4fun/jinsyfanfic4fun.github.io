It was almost silent, drifting up the long driveway to the camp with no engine noise, the only sound the crunch of gravel under its tires. The gunmetal-gray frame came to a halt in the grass field adjacent to the camp that was too-generously labeled “Parking Lot.”</p><p>Caleb stared as the driver’s door opened and a tall man got out. The stranger’s appearance was immaculate—every hair perfectly in place—but something was off. Caleb figured it was probably the Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>“Where is Justin Black?” the man intoned, without preamble.</p><p>Despite Caleb’s considerable strengths as a camp counselor, actually keeping track of the children was a remarkably low priority for him. We’re in the middle of the woods, he told himself, where are they gonna go? For that reason, the Hawaiian-shirted man had caught him off guard.</p><p>“Uh... at camp?” Caleb said, and regretted the words as soon as they spilled from his mouth. Is Justin Black the fat one with the Harry Potter birthmark, he pondered, or the creepy little one who was always trying to give out free hugs?</p><p>“My son. His location.” The man paused for effect. “I require more specific information.”</p><p>Caleb glanced into the open window of the activities building, hoping that he’d happen to see the boy in there.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>“I’ll find him. He’s out by the lake, I think,” Caleb said, putting on his best reassuring voice. He’d better be, he thought, or this is going to be awkward.</p><p>“No,” the man said. “I’ll find him myself.”</p><p>The man walked purposefully toward the forest path, and Caleb quickly followed. There was something off-putting about the guy, and Caleb didn’t recognize him from parents’ night. Could have been the weed, though, he thought. Actually, wasn’t it Justin Black’s dad who’d brought the weed?</p><p>Caleb hurried to catch up to the man’s long strides.</p><p>“Is there a problem?” he asked. “Usually Justin’s mom picks him up—“</p><p>“No problem.” The man cut him off. “I just need to speak with the boy.”</p><p>Yup, he’s a pervert. Who else calls their son “the boy?” Caleb sped up his pursuit.</p><p>“What was your name again?” Caleb asked, hoping it would jog some memory of this guy. “I didn’t catch it before.”</p><p>The man turned, slow and deliberate.</p><p>“Don. Call me Don.”</p><p>The camp counselor was certainly annoying, but it was by no means the worst thing Don had had to put up with in his long and storied existence. His former profession had brought him into contact with the absolute worst of the worst, the darkest blights on the fabric of humankind that ever walked the Earth. I’m like Jerry Springer without the fame, Don thought, amused by his own analogy. After his previous occupation, it didn’t take much to amuse Don. Well, the fame part is about to change.</p><p>Losing the counselor in the forest was a simple matter. One moment, the kid was an arm’s-length away. The next, Don was a quarter-mile ahead of him. The path wound its way down a hill, dense thickets of forest obscuring the view. It would all be over before the counselor caught up.</p><p>The lake itself was pristine and beautiful, its glassy surface rippling with the slight breeze. An amazing summer day, one like Don hadn’t seen in... too long to remember.</p><p>“Ew! Don’t touch it with your bare hands!”</p><p>Don’s head turned an unnatural degree to find the source of the shout. It had come from a girl, about ten years old, running away from a boy of the same age.</p><p>Justin Black.</p><p>“You’re gonna get warts!” the girl cried, desperately dodging away from the frog in Justin’s outstretched hands.</p><p>“No I won’t,” Justin said, “my brother said frogs give you herpes.”</p><p>“What’s that?” the girl asked innocently.</p><p>“I dunno. Why don’t you ask the frog?” Justin thrust the amphibian at her, only to have it leap out of his hands and into the bog at the lake’s edge.</p><p>“Great, now you made me lose it,” Justin complained.</p><p>He reached down into the bog to find the lost creature, but another pair of hands got there first. Don lifted the frog out of the swampy water, holding it delicately, as if the slightest pressure would shatter it.</p><p>“It’s not lost, my boy,” Don said, a warm look on his face.</p><p>Justin took a step back, confused.</p><p>“Dad?”</p><p>“No, Justin, not exactly.”</p><p>The frog croaked loudly, startling both of the children. Justin’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“Mom said you’re not supposed to come see me. She said the police wouldn’t let you.”</p><p>“My boy, that was the old me. There’s a new set of rules, now.” Don held out the frog to Justin, trying to bring the boy closer.</p><p>“You like frogs, don’t you?”</p><p>Caleb’s mind was racing. Where had the man gone? Should he call the cops? How the hell had he got so far ahead? He began to run, hurtling down the path as he started to panic, stumbling over the uneven ground. Then he felt his foot hit a rock, sending him tumbling down the slope and slamming into a tree.</p><p>“Damn it!” he groaned, as the pain shot through him, bringing tears to his eyes. Wincing, he shifted into a sitting position and peered at his leg. His pants were ripped and a trail of blood was seeping down his thigh.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>He pulled himself up, took a step forward, and collapsed. Oh God, I can’t stand. Maybe it’s broken.</p><p>Fear filled his mind. Fear of what would happen to the kids at the lake, fear of what would happen when his boss found out about his inattentiveness, and fear of dying slowly of bloodloss out in the woods where no one could find him.</p><p>Calm the hell down, he thought, this isn’t even that bad. It’s barely even bleeding. That realization helped him get back to his feet. He had managed to hobble a few steps forward when he heard it.</p><p>The blood-curdling scream of Justin Black.</p><h2><span id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</span><a href="#chapter-1" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p><img src="images/00001.jpg" alt="common.jpg">{.calibre10}</p><p>I can feel it, Dean thought. The sky is falling. It wasn’t a new feeling. In fact, the sky had been falling on Dean Winchester since he was four years old. The difference, of course, was that this time could very well be the last time. And this is where it all ends? The Apocalypse is gonna go down in the ass-edge of nowhere?</p><p>Dean let out a tired sigh as he gunned the Impala onto County Road 6. There was nothing on either side of the asphalt except cornfields, cattle, farms and farmers—the very Americana that Dean and his brother Sam fought to protect. For a moment, Dean’s imagination took hold, and the clouds on the horizon became pillars of smoke, spilling from unseen tongues of flame. The rotting wooden beams of a decrepit barn became the last remnants of humanity. Dean shook the vision out of his head, and the clouds were once again clouds. The barn was, once more, just a barn.</p><p>For months, Dean and Sam had been on the suicide mission to end all suicide missions—to hunt down and kill the Devil. Though the weight of the task seemed unbearable, the brothers knew that they were the only ones who could shoulder it. It was, after all, their fault that right now Lucifer walked the earth.</p><p>No. Sam’s fault.</p><p>Dean shoved the thought to the dark recesses of his mind. It wouldn’t do him any good to dwell on it. His younger brother—the boy who Dean had practically raised since their mother died—had broken the Final Seal. In a moment of weakness, Sam had killed the demon Lilith, unintentionally popping the lock on Satan’s cage. Now, after nearly a year of chasing him, they were no closer to shoving the bastard back into the lock-up.</p><p>But that wasn’t even the bad news. The angels, ostensibly protectors of humanity, had in fact been behind Satan’s jailbreak.</p><p>“They wanted you to break the Seal,” Dean had explained to his brother in the moments after Lucifer’s rise. “They’re sick of waiting around in Heaven. With Satan out, they get to bring on the prizefight. Winner takes Earth.”</p><p>The angels already had a plan in motion—according to the winged bastards, the only way to defeat Lucifer was for Dean to be the host for the archangel Michael, the most powerful weapon in Heaven’s arsenal. They even had an overdramatic pet name for Dean: the Michael Sword. Every fiber of Dean’s body rebelled against the idea. The battle between Michael and Lucifer would have the minor side effect of destroying half the Earth. A “planetary enema,” Zachariah had called it. The douche.</p><p>Lucifer’s final vessel was to be Sam. The symmetry must be funny to someone upstairs, Dean thought. Michael and Lucifer were brothers, one of them following closely in their father’s footsteps, the other... Well, just like Sam, Lucifer had always wanted to go his own way.</p><p>However, the one thing neither Heaven nor Hell could control was human will. While on Earth, angels—both righteous and fallen—had to take a willing human host. If Sam and Dean didn’t say “yes” to Lucifer and Michael, the battle couldn’t happen. The archangels would have to putter around in their alternate, non-ordained meatsuits, tearing their lesser vessels apart while they waited for Sam and Dean to come around to the party line.</p><p>The Winchester brothers weren’t going to fight each other. There had to be another way.</p><p>But every time they thought they had Lucifer within their sights, fate slapped their faces again. They had tried their old standby: straight-up violence, attempting to kill Lucifer outright. First with the Colt, a gun so powerful it was said to be able to kill anything, but that had barely given their Adversary a headache. They had Ruby’s demon-killing knife, but that was just as impotent against an archangel. The only chance they had left was to catch Lucifer by surprise. No small feat.</p><p>“Take a right at Camp Dakota Road,” Sam directed.</p><p>“Really? Couldn’t have figured that one out, Sam,” Dean shot back. “Since we’re going to a camp.”</p><p>Sam had been getting under his skin recently. Actually, everything had been getting under his skin. The endless hours on the road had proven useless thus far, and Dean was beginning to doubt that they would be able to win this war.</p><p>Can’t fight something you can’t find, he thought. But he also had doubts about his role in the battle to come. Even if I’m doing everything in my power to find another way... can someone change the role they’re destined by fate to play? Avoiding destiny is what Dean and Sam had been doing so far. But how much longer can we keep that up? They were flying under the angels’ radar, and for now, that was enough.</p><p>It had to be.</p><p>A week ago Sam had started tracking the local news from a small town in South Dakota. It had been lighting up with apocalyptic signs like an end-of-the-world Christmas tree.</p><p>Maybe we’re finally getting a freakin’ break, Dean thought hopefully.</p><p>Their first stop was a kids’ day camp. A gas station attendant a couple of towns over had told them about it. The scruffy dude had said he didn’t rightly know what had happened, but his cousin’s girlfriend’s mom had told him that it was like something out of the Bible and children had been harmed. That alone was enough to warrant a visit.</p><p>Dean pushed the accelerator to the Impala’s firewall, his hazel eyes glinting with anger. Every second they were delayed, Lucifer got another step ahead of them.</p><p>Sam threw a sideways glance at Dean. Thanks to all the years they had spent on the road, Sam could read his older brother’s mood just by the way he tightened his grip on the steering wheel or blew his breath out through his nose in short staccato bursts.</p><p>Dean’s pissed about something again, Sam thought. And probably for no good reason. Sam felt the constant burden of his brother’s anger and expectations. Chief among them was the expectation that they’d do things Dean’s way—or, more accurately, John Winchester’s way. The pressure to fit into their father’s shoes had always been immense—doubly so since his death—and Dean was the poster child for Daddy’s boys. He dressed like John Winchester, drove his car, listened to his music. He even walked like John. Sam, on the other hand, had tried time and time again to get free of his father and everything that he represented. Now, Sam realized that Dean felt like his brother had strayed too far off the path, at times even irretrievably. He had dealt with demons, using the power that their blood gave him... all things that John would never have allowed. Despite all of that, Sam was fine. He knew that, he just wished that Dean would realize it too. For the most part, Dean seemed to trust him, but that didn’t mean they would always get along.</p><p>The final battle is looming, and we’re stuck smack dab in the middle of it. Sam pursed his lips together—he felt like they were coming to the end of something. He just didn’t know what.</p><p>Preoccupied, Sam glanced out the passenger window just as the Impala careened by the split log sign for CAMP WITKI NIKI.</p><p>“There!” he shouted, a little too loudly, pointing at the sign.</p><p>“G-and-an-H crap!” Dean yelled, as he turned the wheel quickly to the left, fishtailing the Impala’s tires, a spray of gravel hitting the trees on both sides of the deeply rutted driveway. “Inside voice, inside voice!” Dean spat. He opened his mouth to say more, then clearly decided to drop it.</p><p>The Impala bumped its way over the gravel.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “So what are we walking into?”</p><p>Relieved his brother’s outburst was over, Sam grabbed his laptop.</p><p>“From what I can find, a bunch of creeped out parents, but no dead kids. Guess our gas station buddy was overstating that part.” Sam pulled up the Grenville, South Dakota Tribune webpage and scanned the article.</p><p>“There’s this posting on a comment board written by some totally hysterical mother named Nancy Johnson. Something huge happened yesterday, but she doesn’t say what, just that a strange man walked into the camp. It scared the bejesus out of all the parents, but there’s nothing in the police report, so technically no crime was committed. This woman writes, ‘Considering the highly sensitive nature of the children at Witki Niki, it is of the utmost importance that each child be under an adult’s care at all times.’”</p><p>Dean brought the Impala to a stop on a grass field. Pulling on the hand-brake he turned to Sam.</p><p>“We’re here because some berserk Betty on a mommy-blog vents that a ‘strange guy’ walked into little Timmy’s day camp? Are you effing kidding me, Sam?” Dean paused for a moment to let his frustration sink in. “What, so if somebody farts in Yankee stadium, we run it down as a demon?”</p><p>Sam sighed. Sometimes he felt as if he could never to do anything right for Dean.</p><p>“There are apocalyptic omens here. The attendant says it was straight out of the Book of Revelation... You don’t think that’s worth looking into?”</p><p>Sam pushed open the car door. Then he heard it.</p><p>“What the hell is that?” Dean growled, emerging from the other side of the Impala.</p><p>A cacophony of what sounded like a thousand dying car horns emanated from behind a grove of trees. Sam and Dean looked at each other, the edginess of the last twenty minutes now dropped.</p><p>Sam sprang into action. Ears stinging from the piercing noise, he ran round to the back of the car, popped open the trunk and lifted up the false bottom to reveal their secret stash of weapons and materials. Dean reached in and backhanded Sam a revolver, taking a sawed-off for himself. He slipped the shotgun down the back of his worn Levi’s with practiced ease.</p><p>Sam palmed a quart bag of salt and slipped it into his breast pocket. Never be caught off guard, he thought, hearing his father’s words as if John was standing two feet away.</p><p>They strode through the grass with deliberation, the strange noise getting louder and louder. As they reached a rocky path that led down a slope, they heard a high-pitched voice call out, “Hey! Stop! I said stop!”</p><p>The Winchesters turned and were accosted by a freckled, red-haired youth, several inches shorter than Dean and several years younger than Sam. He came limping toward them, an elaborate-looking air cast on his left leg.</p><p>He managed to get within a few yards of them before he had to start hopping on his good foot. Dean looked the young man up and down, eying his lime-green cast.</p><p>“Wow, that’s some injury there. You get that playing World of Warcraft, or doing some major texting on lonelygeek dot com?”</p><p>Sam saw the guy’s face immediately sour. Smooth, Dean.</p><p>“I got it on duty,” the young man squeaked out.</p><p>“Really. On duty?” Dean said, smirking. “What do you do, exactly?”</p><p>“I’m head junior counselor. Who the hell are you?”</p><p>But Dean had already lost interest and was making his way down the hill.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, kid.”</p><p>Sam glanced at his brother’s retreating back, then smiled at the young man. “We’re just checking some stuff out. Were you here yesterday? I’m sorry, what’s your name?”</p><p>The young man looked embarrassed and Sam could see sweat bead on his upper lip, despite the breeze.</p><p>“Caleb. It wasn’t my fault,” he stuttered. “The EPA said it was just a freak explosion—“</p><p>“Explosion?” Sam interrupted.</p><p>“Yeah, freak explosion of the population.”</p><p>“The population of what?”</p><p>His answer didn’t come from Caleb, but from the tree line.</p><p>“FROGS!”</p><p>Sam turned to see Dean holding up a large frog. Dean took one of the amphibian’s front legs between his thumb and forefinger and made it wave at his brother to join him. Sam thanked the kid and headed down the hill to meet Dean.</p><p>“Can you believe this?” Dean said, gesturing toward the sea of frogs that were hopping around the forest floor. “Guess Kermit and Miss Piggy have been busy.”</p><p>Sam walked past him toward the lake.</p><p>“Okay, you got your frog-sex joke in, but now are you going to tell me I was right? I mean, this is about as apocalyptic as it gets.”</p><p>“I guess so.” Dean gently put down the frog and caught up with Sam. “Remind me what the deal is with frogs and the Apocalypse?”</p><p>Sam looked toward the lakeshore, where every kid in the camp was sprinting around with buckets, bags, milk crates— anything that could carry more than one frog. He spotted several makeshift frog-racing sites, as well as kids trying to make frogs play badminton, kids having frog tea parties, a couple of kids trying to have frogs play basketball—there was even one lonely kid that had set up frogs for a mock trial. Deep inside him, Sam again wished his childhood had been more normal. The kids here were having a ball, despite the biblical overtones of the situation.</p><p>Sam turned to his brother.</p><p>“In Exodus, God rained frogs down on the Egyptians as punishment for not letting the Israelites free. ‘And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.’”</p><p>“Okay, so frogs are bad. But these kids are going apeshit over them. Doesn’t look so terrible to me.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. He didn’t have all the answers.</p><p>Caleb tottered down the hillside and caught up to them.</p><p>“Excuse me, I still didn’t get your names,” he said.</p><p>Dean scowled at him.</p><p>“Why don’t you tell us how all these frogs got here.”</p><p>Caleb threw his hands in the air, exasperated.</p><p>“Like I told Mr. Butler! How many times do I have to explain this?”</p><p>“Who’s Mr. Butler?” Sam asked.</p><p>“My boss,” Caleb said with a hearty eye-roll. “Justin Black’s father showed up out of the blue yesterday. I didn’t exactly realize he wasn’t supposed to see his son. Guy was acting kind of strange, and the next thing I know he’s down at the lake with the kids. Then all hell broke loose.”</p><p>Dean surveyed the children running around in near-hysterical, frog-induced mayhem. A few tired-looking counselors were trying—and for the most-part failing—to keep some kind of control.</p><p>“Where is Justin Black?”</p><p>Dean and Sam made their way toward a large rectangular log cabin dining hall. Inside, little Justin Black sat at a long table. He was pudgy, and wore a striped shirt a size too small and cargo shorts five inches too long, Dean could tell that Justin wasn’t the most popular kid at Camp Witki Niki. Dean himself would have made fun of this kid.</p><p>Justin’s face was red and splotchy from crying. A large frog sat in his lap, and his fingers stroked its flat head like it was a golden retriever.</p><p>“Justin?” Sam said gently.</p><p>The boy looked up suspiciously.</p><p>“Justin, hey. I’m Sam, and this is my brother Dean.”</p><p>Dean gritted his teeth. Aliases, Sam, aliases. Guy has such a soft spot for kids.</p><p>“Justin, we know that your dad came to see you yesterday. Was that the first time you’d seen him in a while?” Sam made his way to the bench next to Justin, and the boy nodded his head.</p><p>“Not supposed to see him till he pays my mom all the supports,” he murmured, and then sniffed and wiped his dripping nose with the back of his hand.</p><p>“You mean child support?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Justin said, keeping his eyes on the table.</p><p>Sam scooted toward Justin a little.</p><p>“You know what kind of frog that is?” he asked.</p><p>“It’s a Rana catesbeiana, American Bullfrog,” Justin said with a short snort.</p><p>“Oh, of course,” Sam said, gently touching the frog’s head. “Justin, did your dad seem... normal yesterday?”</p><p>“Umm. What do you mean?” Justin moved the frog away from Sam’s reach.</p><p>“Did you recognize him right away?” Dean probed. He pressed his hands on the table and leaned toward the boy. Sam gave him a warning stare, indicating that he should take it easy.</p><p>“He’s my dad,” the boy responded.</p><p>“No, I know that, but did you notice anything different about him?” Dean persisted.</p><p>“Well. Like maybe...” Justin trailed off as he inspected his frog.</p><p>“Like maybe what?”</p><p>“Maybe he wasn’t like usual... like... mean.” Justin’s large wet eyes met Dean’s.</p><p>“Do you think that was your dad, Justin?” Dean asked, crouching so his head was level with the boy’s.</p><p>“Of course. He brought me my favorite thing.” Justin rearranged himself on the bench.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Justin looked at Dean like he was a complete idiot.</p><p>“Frogs. What else?”</p><p>Sam and Dean got back into the Impala.</p><p>“Okay, so the kid’s father shows up, hasn’t seen him for a while. Guy used to be a dick, now he’s bringing Justin a butt-load of his favorite apocalyptic omen? What, the store was out of Super Soakers?” Dean pressed his fingers into his forehead, soothing a building headache. “Who is this guy?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Later that day, the Impala rumbled its way through the small town of Waubay, South Dakota. Like so many American factory towns, the place seemed mostly deserted.</p><p>“Keep your eyes open, we may be walking into Hell’s favorite fishing ground,” Dean said as they parked. He tucked the shotgun underneath his worn leather jacket.</p><p>The brothers walked side by side down the empty streets. The facades of the small mom-and-pop stores were mostly run-down. Paint peeled off the clapboard, giving everything a rag-tag look.</p><p>An obnoxiously loud rumble broke the silence, causing Dean and Sam to swivel on their heels, only to see a jacked-up pick-up truck swing around a corner and disappear. No one else was around.</p><p>Then someone screamed. The boys looked at each other.</p><p>“Where did that come from?” Dean exclaimed, sweeping the streets, wide-eyed. They still seemed to be alone.</p><p>They heard another scream. Sam cocked his weapon, aiming at a nearby intersection.</p><p>“This way,” he said.</p><p>The boys took off, their heavy boots pounding the pavement as they turned the corner and heard it again. Sweat ran down their faces as they skidded to a halt in front of—</p><p>The Waubay Community Swimming Pool. The pool was empty and several old women were wandering around in bathing caps and large tent-like bathing suits. Dean looked at Sam, who just shrugged.</p><p>“What just happened here?” Dean called out, one hand shielding his eyes from the bone-chilling display of geriatric flesh.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Sam was also having trouble dealing with the half-naked old women. He spied a young-looking guy in sweat pants, holding a whistle, and moved toward him.</p><p>“Can you tell us what’s going on?” he asked.</p><p>The guy, whom he assumed must be a swim instructor, squinted at Sam in confusion.</p><p>“I have no idea,” he said helplessly. “I was giving our regular aquatics class, and the pool just started bubbling.”</p><p>“Bubbling like... boiling?” Sam asked.</p><p>Joining them, Dean smirked.</p><p>“You sure one of these lithe young ladies didn’t lay one?” he said.</p><p>The instructor tilted his head sideways at Dean, a look of surprised irritation Sam had seen directed at his brother with some frequency. Without another word, Dean walked away, wisely leaving the interrogation to Sam.</p><p>“Was anyone hurt?” Sam asked, trying to brush past the instructor’s annoyance.</p><p>“No,” the man replied. “No one gets hurt on my watch. It’s just like I said: the pool started bubbling, scared the scream out of everyone here. Who are you guys anyway?”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Inspectors Antilles and Solo, we’re with the NPSS, National Pool Safety Systems. Have you had your filter updated to the latest safety standards?”</p><p>“Of course I have,” the instructor answered, scowling. “What kind of community pool do you think I’m running?”</p><p>Sam took a step back.</p><p>“Fantastic, we’re always happy to see a dedicated guy like yourself take responsibility. Pool safety is...” Sam trailed off. “... important. I guess. Thanks for your time.”</p><p>Sam joined his brother, who was interviewing a large woman with a bellowing voice. Dean nodded at Sam’s approach.</p><p>“Myra, could you tell my partner here what you just told me?” Dean asked.</p><p>Myra pulled her robe tighter around her.</p><p>“We was just doing our morning routine when the water started getting bubbly,” she boomed. “Slowly at first and then more and more, then it got hot. Real hot, but not enough to boil you. The weird thing was, Eunice and me were just saying that the pool was way too cold to be in it.”</p><p>Sam cocked his head. “Wait, you just said you were cold, then the water got warmer by itself?”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Myra said, nodding her bathing cap-clad head.</p><p>Thanking Myra, Sam and Dean walked away and headed back through town to the Impala.</p><p>“There are lots of references to water transformation in the lore,” Sam said. “Turning to blood, floods... and boiling.”</p><p>“So, it’s the frickin’ Apocalypse, the town is lit up with apocalyptic signs, but they’re... jokes?”</p><p>“You think it’s the Trickster?” Sam gulped. “Gabriel, that is.”</p><p>“Not a chance,” Dean said. “Not his M.O. He’s not one to leave survivors, you know?”</p><p>“So what is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Is My Little Pony one of the Four Horsemen?”</p><p>Dean parked in front of a battered motel. The neon sign read ‘Two Pines Motel,’ and sported two fluorescent pine trees blinking alternately, so it looked like they were swinging in a stiff wind.</p><p>“Oh good, there’s a fish cleaning station on the premises,” Dean said sarcastically.</p><p>“We’re in prime walleye country,” Sam noted. Dean hopped out of the car and headed for the motel lobby.</p><p>Two minutes later, Sam was startled by the thump of Dean banging on the hood. A key dangled from a fish-shaped key lug in his outstretched hand.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Sam pulled his duffel out of the trunk and followed Dean into a wood-paneled, simply appointed motel room.</p><p>Dean threw himself onto one of the beds.</p><p>“So where do we go from here?” he asked.</p><p>Sam pulled out a chair and sat down, tugging his boots off and kicking them underneath the wooden table.</p><p>“I guess we see if we can find anything on Justin’s father. Only real lead we have.”</p><p>An hour later, the boys were knee-deep in research. Dean was sprawled out on the bed, his laptop on his chest.</p><p>“Don Black’s DMV records are clean, so are his credit cards—meaning he doesn’t have any. Guy is just a poor schlub trying to make a living.”</p><p>With a couple of simple clicks, Sam had hacked into the local county records.</p><p>“Listen to this. From the family court records, Don Black owed $15,000 to his ex-wife in back child support. Yesterday he paid it all off, in cash. How do you explain that? And I took a look at the auto sales in a hundred-mile radius. Seems yesterday he walked into a dealership and bought a Prius, also using cash.”</p><p>Dean swung his legs onto the floor.</p><p>“Huh. Can’t say I can picture a demon driving a hybrid,” he said. “Okay, he’s the World’s Number One Earth-Loving Dad. He’s not Lucifer. Let’s get the hell out of here.”</p><p>“Can we at least talk to Justin’s mom before we leave?” Sam got up, pulled his boots and coat back on and opened the door.</p><p>Dean stayed where he was.</p><p>“He just paid her fifteen large in cash, you really think she’s gonna sell him down the river?” he asked.</p><p>“Best shot we’ve got,” Sam responded.</p><p>Dean looked at his brother hesitantly. “Where is she?”</p><p>“She works at a restaurant down the road.” Sam nodded his head toward the Impala, visible through the open door.</p><p>Dean dragged himself off the bed. He gave the room a scornful look as he walked outside.</p><p>“As long as it gets us out of this motel. Place smells like Ariel took a dump.”</p><p>A shrill bell announced their arrival at the diner. The small smattering of locals turned Sam and Dean’s way, then quickly went back to their lunches. A pretty redhead stood at the pass-through barking orders at an overweight fry cook.</p><p>“Tommy, how many times do I have to tell you, medium rare ain’t a bloody cow on a bun,” she yelled at him.</p><p>“Kathy Black?” Dean queried. “Ex-wife of Don Black?”</p><p>“Who’s asking?” the redhead demanded, her expression stiffening at the mention of Don. Her reaction was enough to confirm her identity.</p><p>“Listen, I don’t know where he is,” she continued, not waiting for a reply, “but if he owes you money I’m not paying it. And I keep a sawed-off under my pillow in case you have any ideas.”</p><p>“We aren’t loan sharks, ma’am,” Sam said. “We just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your husband.”</p><p>“As he said, ex-husband,” Kathy replied pointedly.</p><p>“Right, ex,” Dean said, stepping in. “My partner apologizes. He doesn’t know how to talk to women. Do you know where Don might be?”</p><p>Kathy frowned, the wrinkles becoming more pronounced on her otherwise attractive face. Years spent trying to wheedle information out of people had taught Dean a couple of things. Never ask questions that are going to waste busy people’s time, and never piss off an ex-wife.</p><p>“You cops?”</p><p>Sam shook his head. “No. Not cops.”</p><p>“‘Cause he hates cops.”</p><p>“So do we,” Dean said with a Cheshire-Cat smile. “Do you know if there’s some place he likes to hang out?”</p><p>Kathy’s gaze shifted to one of her tables across the diner.</p><p>“Listen, I gotta get that guy back there more coffee—“</p><p>“Please,” Sam interrupted. “We work at the dealership. My partner forgot to get Don’s signature on his new car’s registration, and our boss is gonna take it out of my ass—“</p><p>Kathy waved at Sam to stop talking.</p><p>“Fine. Whatever. If he’s around, he’s usually at Polly’s Bar, down round the corner, beige building on the right.”</p><p>Sam and Dean thanked her and left.</p><p>A few minutes later they were outside Polly’s Bar, an ugly old establishment squashed between two uglier buildings. Dean pulled open the door and ducked his head as he stepped through the low entrance.</p><p>As his eyes adjusted to the dimly lit room, he made out a narrow dingy-looking interior with a small number of patrons crowded into one corner. A high-pitched, fast-talking voice immediately drew his attention. Dean and Sam crossed to the bar, where a Hawaiian-shirted man was holding court with the townies.</p><p>“So then the priest says, ‘It can’t be my credit card, because I answer to a higher power.’” The townies snorted a laugh. “Okay, next round on me.” The man gestured around the bar wildly. “For everyone!”</p><p>Dean stood watching, Sam beside him, as the guy took in the small collection of half-hearted whoops and claps that followed.</p><p>“I gotta go to the head,” the man said, peeling off toward the back of the dark room. He entered the hallway, and his head was ratcheted against the wall with a thwack. Dean spun him around forcefully, knocking the wind out of the older man, and shoving his forearm under the guy’s chin.</p><p>Not to flatter himself, but Dean fully expected the guy to wet himself with terror—especially since he was on the way to the bathroom—but the man merely laughed.</p><p>“Hey, if it isn’t the Winchester boys!” he cried. “Ease up. Certainly took you guys long enough.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Shut it, pal. We know what you are, and we know just how to kill you.”</p><p>It was a less than accurate assessment, but Dean made sure his words overflowed with confidence. No sense letting on that this particular brand of freak had them stumped. Has to be a freak, Dean thought. Only the freaks recognize us. The pretense was betrayed by Sam’s stifled cough. Dean shot him a look—Shut the hell up. There was a reason Dean did the poker hustling in the family.</p><p>“Well, we sort of know what you are. You’re a douche, you’re causing problems here, and for us violence is usually the best solution.”</p><p>“Listen guys, I’ve been waiting more than a while... in a bar... for you to get here,” Don said with a bit of edge. “I’m not sure a human bladder can take much more pressure. Can this wait till after I hit the pisser?” He shifted his weight awkwardly back and forth between his legs.</p><p>Dean shoved the man roughly into a tattered booth tucked into the furthest gloomy back corner of the bar, far from the prying eyes of the watering hole’s patrons. Don’t need any of them sticking up for this guy if things go pear-shaped.</p><p>“Not likely, Hawaii Five-Oh. We’ve got to sort some things out first.” Dean cast a sideways glance at his brother. “Sam?”</p><p>With a nod, Sam reached into his jacket pocket for the bag of rock salt, but his hand came out empty.</p><p>“Damn left it in the car,” he muttered. Leaving Dean holding Don hostage in the booth, Sam headed back toward the throng of confused folks at the bar, all no doubt wondering what was happening to their free-drinks ticket. He returned with a handful of salt shakers, which he quickly began to twist open.</p><p>Should have brought the rock salt shotguns, Dean thought. Then we wouldn’t have to resort to these cheap tricks. If Don Black was possessed by a demon, he’d be vulnerable to salt, but it’d take more than a sprinkle. Things would have to get messy.</p><p>“If you really were expecting us, you know that we’ve taken down more than our fair share of your kind.” Dean’s bravado was reaching fever pitch. “Truth is, baby bro here doesn’t even need the salt. He uses his kung-fu grip, your ass is smote back to the pit.”</p><p>It was clear that all three of them knew he was bluffing. Anyone with a passing familiarity with the Apocalypse knew about Sam’s demon-blood addiction and where that dark road had led him.</p><p>Don chuckled softly.</p><p>“You think... you think I’m a demon?” With a bemused look, he lifted one of the salt shakers from the table and upended it, spilling its contents into his mouth. After a moment, he nonchalantly spat the salt onto the table. “Bam.”</p><p>Well, since he’s not choking to death on his own boiling entrails, I guess he’s not a demon. Dean considered the situation, but didn’t see any other alternative. Might as well ask the bastard.</p><p>“Fine then. I give. What the hell are you?”</p><p>“Hell? That’s your problem, Dean. Always looking in the wrong direction.” Don reached out and grabbed Dean’s chin, and before he could object, tilted it upward.</p><p>“Whoa, buddy,” Dean snapped, “bad touch!”</p><p>In an instant, Sam was holding the blade of Ruby’s demon-killing knife to Don’s throat.</p><p>“You guys aren’t great listeners. What is a cursed knife gonna do to an angel?”</p><p>Sam and Dean shared a stunned look. If Don was telling the truth, he had a point. Without an angelic blade, they might as well be throwing peanuts at him.</p><p>“An angel?” Sam asked, slowly pulling the knife away from Don’s jugular. “What kind of angel goes around boiling little old ladies and setting off apocalyptic omens?”</p><p>A jackass angel, Dean thought, which doesn’t exactly narrow it down.</p><p>“I really did think you’d be here a week ago,” Don said sheepishly. “I left plenty of harmless clues. I didn’t get to the frogs and the boiling and whatnot until I realized you weren’t catching on. Isn’t one of you supposed to be smart? A doctor or something?” Sam looked away, a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Lawyer, actually. Ain’t that right, Sammy?” Dean said, slapping his brother on the back with a smirk.</p><p>Don seemed to struggle to hold back his laughter.</p><p>“Lucifer’s vessel on Earth is a lawyer? How perfect is that?”</p><p>“I dropped out of law school,” Sam interjected pointedly. “And I’m nobody’s vessel.”</p><p>“That’s the spirit, Sam. Not to mention exactly what I brought you here to talk about,” Don said a little too excitedly.</p><p>“Next time you want to talk, try calling before you hurt any kids,” Sam said.</p><p>“Nobody got hurt. It was a bunch of frogs. And it’s kind of hard to get in touch with you two, what with the mojo carved into your ribs.” Don said, referring to the Enochian Sigil, an ancient and complex pattern that the angel Castiel had burned into Sam and Dean’s ribcages as protection against both sides in the Apocalypse: the angels and the demons. Without it, Michael and Lucifer would be on them faster than Dean on a bacon cheeseburger.</p><p>“Fair enough,” Dean relented. “So what now? You stick the rest of the angels on us, we bolt, and we start this dance all over again tomorrow?” Even as the words came out of his mouth, Dean knew the ‘bolting’ part wouldn’t work. If it came to blows, the odds were in the angel’s favor. They weren’t leaving the bar unless Don wanted them to.</p><p>Don sat up straight.</p><p>“Not at all. This has nothing to do with them, and everything to do with helping you.”</p><p>“Only help we need is keeping off angel radar,” Dean growled.</p><p>Sam’s eyes darted over to meet his. Dean knew that meant only one thing: he was about to cause trouble.</p><p>“You said you wanted to talk about me... about being Lucifer’s vessel.” Sam began, and then paused, as though trying to find the words. “Everyone we’ve talked to, on both sides, acts like it’s inevitable. That the battle is between Dean and me.”</p><p>Don nodded gravely.</p><p>“But there has to be another way,” Sam said. “There always is.”</p><p>“You’re right. Becoming Lucifer’s vessel isn’t the only way to end the war; it’s just the fastest. I can’t guarantee you’ll love the alternatives, but they are out there.”</p><p>“Sam, don’t let this guy get inside your head,” Dean said, worried. “We don’t know for sure who he is, and even if he is an angel... well, their track record ain’t so great.”</p><p>“Look who’s talking,” Don responded. “At least I didn’t bring on the End Times. And Dean, let’s not forget about your part in this little dance.”</p><p>This guy’s just as much of an asshole as the rest of the angels, Dean thought. Despite their common reputation as agents of God’s will, forces of good, and the gold standard for morality, all the angels Dean had met over the last year had been shifty, manipulative dicks. Except Cass, of course. Castiel had rebelled against the rest of the Heavenly Host when the angels conspired to bring about the Apocalypse.</p><p>“Why would you help us?” Sam asked. “Why break from the party line?”</p><p>“Fellas, I have a vested interest here,” Don said in a low whisper. “I’ve been cooped up for thousands of years, couldn’t even get a weekend off to visit your lovely little corner of the world. Now everything’s changed. It’s all hands on deck for the Apocalypse, and here I am. In the paradise God made for you.” He gestured at the bar. “I love it here.”</p><p>Dean stared the angel down.</p><p>“So, what? You want us to keep running? Keep the Apocalypse raging until you’ve filled up on piña coladas?”</p><p>“Not in the slightest. I can show you how to defeat Lucifer without becoming the Michael Sword.” Don’s gaze drifted to Sam. “And without Lucifer playing house inside of Sam. It just so happens that I’d get to stay on Earth as well. Win, win, win.”</p><p>Dean saw Sam’s Adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallowed hard. He could see the wheels spinning in his brother’s head, trying to work out the possibilities here. All told, Sam was in a much worse spot than Dean. Win or lose, Sam had flicked the switch on Judgment Day, and if the battle between the Winchester brothers did come to pass... Well, either the Devil would win, or Sam would be dead.</p><p>“We’re gonna need more than that,” Dean said. “We’ve got no reason to believe any of this crap.”</p><p>“Then let me give you the full picture,” Don said, anger brimming in his voice. “I’ve spent the last few thousand years as a warden with a very high-profile prisoner—until the day you boys let him spring the coop.” Don leaned in close, his breath washing over Dean’s face. Dean flinched. Guy should lay off the onion rings.</p><p>“I was stuck in Hell,” Don continued, “guarding the gates like a good soldier while you were off drinking demon blood and betraying your race. I had to watch souls screaming with no reprieve while Satan and his pals tortured them.” With that, he gave Dean a knowing look.</p><p>Dean felt his blood boil.</p><p>“That’s enough,” he growled, struggling to control himself. He had spent some quality time in Hell, and after experiencing the equivalent of thirty years of torture, he had accepted a bargain... Dean had tortured other souls in exchange for being taken off the rack himself. That moment of weakness had broken the first of the sixty-six Seals that had freed Lucifer.</p><p>Don looked over at Sam.</p><p>“And you just opened the back door for him,” he spat.</p><p>Sam’s fist clenched around the demon-killing knife. The blade pushed into the table’s wooden surface, carving out a deep gouge.</p><p>“I suffered for my work. For my creator. But now that Lucifer’s free, there’s nothing for me to guard. I get called up here, and what do I find out? God’s gone. MIA.”</p><p>“That’s not true,” Sam said softly, his eyes on Ruby’s knife. He had always had more faith than Dean, but that faith was being sorely tested these days. The archangel Raphael had claimed that God was gone, but how were they really to know? How was anyone—even the angels? If God didn’t want to be found, he wouldn’t be found. That didn’t stop Cass from searching for him (or her, Dean thought) across the whole damn planet.</p><p>“All that time spent in the pit, you hear things,” Don continued, ignoring Sam’s quiet riposte. “A lot of truly awful things, but every now and then... a secret. Something Lucifer didn’t want me to hear. A tiny clue as to how he can be defeated, earned by years of my suffering.”</p><p>“Can’t be true,” Dean said with a gravelly edge. “You’d have told the rest of the angel gang and we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Don scolded. “Do you think, when all is said and done, that Michael will just kill Lucifer?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said grimly. For Sam, that was the central dilemma.</p><p>“Then you don’t know how Michael’s mind works. He’s going to defeat Lucifer, and then humiliate him. He’ll invent a new level of suffering even worse than Hell and stick Lucifer in it to wallow, and who do you think he’ll get to guard it?” Don was seething now, almost spitting as he spoke. “I’m not going back to Hell. Not after living up here.”</p><p>“And you know how to—“</p><p>“Kill Lucifer entirely? Remove the need for there to even be a Hell? Yes.” Don was suddenly icy calm, which was somehow creepier than his anger. “I’m gonna give you boys a minute to wrap your brains around all this,” he added with a broad smile as he stood up. “Even angels have to pee.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam watched Don disappear into the back hallway of the bar, uncertain if he should try to stop him. At this point, it didn’t seem like he was going to run off.</p><p>“What the hell was that?” Dean asked, his hands at his temples. He didn’t handle information dumps well.</p><p>“If it’s true—“</p><p>“Of course it’s not true,” Dean interrupted. “You think something like that would slip Cass’s mind? That Michael isn’t even going to off Lucifer?”</p><p>“He’s our friend, but he’s still an angel. He hasn’t always been honest with us before.” Sam knew that was hard for his brother to hear—Dean had been growing closer and closer to Cass since the angel had rebelled against Heaven.</p><p>Dean squinted at Sam, stupefied. “You’re not considering this, are you? Some crazy comes up from Hell and has an offer that’s too good to be true? This sounding familiar?”</p><p>“Is this about Ruby?” Sam asked pointedly. After all of the work the brothers had done to fix things between them, Sam’s relationship with Ruby was still a delicate subject. It would be off limits completely, if anything was off limits to Dean.</p><p>“This is about us wanting to get off the hook, to throw the yoke off our backs and let somebody else pull the load.”</p><p>Dean wasn’t entirely wrong, but that didn’t change the fact that they needed options. Before they met Don, their choices were either to accept Michael and Lucifer, or to let the world fall apart while they looked on.</p><p>“It’s not just our Apocalypse,” Sam said. “If Bobby came to us with another way to end the war, you’d listen.”</p><p>“Bobby’s different. Bobby’s human.”</p><p>“Who’s Bobby?” a voice asked from behind them. It was Don, back from the bathroom. Looking refreshed, he held up his hand to the bartender. “A round for me and my two new friends.”</p><p>The bartender threw a hardened, distrustful glance at Sam and Dean, then started to pour their beers.</p><p>“Bobby ain’t on your radar, and he’s not gonna be,” Dean replied.</p><p>Sam leaned toward Don cautiously, trying to extend an olive branch.</p><p>“Say we believe you. Say we’re even willing to help you. What happens next? Why do you need a couple of humans?”</p><p>“Because the book was written for humans,” Don responded, as if it was obvious.</p><p>“The book?” Sam asked, confused. “I thought you heard this from Lucifer directly?”</p><p>“That’s right. I heard about the book from Lucifer.”</p><p>“And?” Dean asked, annoyed.</p><p>“And what?”</p><p>“And what is it?” Dean spat out, the words almost falling on top of each other.</p><p>“A manual. A book of strategy, if you like, a... a war guide... A cheat sheet for the Apocalypse.”</p><p>“Written by?” Dean demanded.</p><p>Don grabbed a beer from the bartender’s outstretched hand.</p><p>“God,” he answered.</p><p>“And you walked away?! I knew y’all were idjits, I just didn’t know the extent.” Dean was always relieved to hear Bobby Singer’s voice, no matter how annoyed he sounded. He may not be blood, but he was the only family the boys had left.</p><p>“Told him we needed some time to think it over,” Dean said, shifting his cell phone away from his ear to protect his hearing from the auditory onslaught. Dean was alone in the fish-scented motel room while Sam had gone out for food. Dean found it hard to think on an empty stomach, and there was no way he was gonna share a meal with Don the d-bag angel.</p><p>“I bet you did. Did you also tell him to come and bring me some new damn legs?” Bobby responded with his usual rancor. Dean had forgotten momentarily about Bobby’s disability. Bobby had been stabbed by Ruby’s knife a few months back and become paralyzed, left to live out the Apocalypse in a wheelchair. It was the worst possible fate for a man who prided himself on being self-sufficient.</p><p>“I kept you out of it. The less the angels know about you, the better. For all of us,” Dean said.</p><p>“What, because I’m a slow-moving target now? I can take care of my damned self, Dean.” Bobby’s voice cracked slightly, betraying the hardship his impairment had caused.</p><p>“I know you can, Bobby,” Dean said, and then tried to reroute the conversation back into productive territory. “Do you know anything about this book? It’s called The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness.”</p><p>“Everybody’s heard of it,” Bobby replied, sounding more like his usual self. “It’s a segment of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and one of the most widely read apocryphal texts in Christendom. Trouble is, nobody’s read the ending.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because it don’t exist. When the scrolls went up for sale in ‘54 there was a big to-do. Somebody broke into the Waldorf Astoria, where they were being auctioned, and the next day they couldn’t find the last page, what they called the ‘War Scroll.’ Lore says it was destroyed... That the Devil didn’t like what it had to say.”</p><p>So much for an easy answer, Dean thought. But at least Don’s story checks out.</p><p>“And the bit he said about it being a field guide to the End Times?”</p><p>“More like a field guide to gutting the Devil,” Bobby said grimly. “It gets pretty specific. Battle formations, a timeline, you name it. But that last page... how to defeat Satan himself? That could change everything.”</p><p>“Thanks for keeping expectations low, Bobby. So if it’s been destroyed, how does Don the angel lead us to it?”</p><p>“Should of asked him instead of storming off, dimwit.” There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Could be it wasn’t destroyed, just hidden. Put someplace safe where Lucifer knew no one would find it.”</p><p>“So all we have to do is find something hidden by the Devil himself. Easy peasy.”</p><p>Dean heard the door open behind him, letting a gust of cold air rush in, rustling the drapes and sending a chill down his spine. He turned to see Sam enter the room, a guilty look on his face.</p><p>“Bobby, I’ve gotta go...”</p><p>And then Dean saw him. Don the angel, striding in right after Sam.</p><p>“Sam, what the hell’s going on?” Dean dropped the cell phone to his side, but could still hear Bobby’s tinny voice calling out from the speaker.</p><p>“Dean, I’m sorry. Really, I am. But you’re not the one that’s facing an angel firing squad no matter what he does.” Sam tried to hold eye contact with Dean, but the older Winchester looked away. He stared instead at Don, who was still wearing that damn Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>“What did you say to him?” Dean asked the angel harshly.</p><p>“I told him the truth. That you’ll understand it all in time.” Don’s words were the last thing Dean heard before the sudden, precipitous drop.</p><p>Sam awoke to the sound of screaming, terrifyingly close. It was accompanied by the thrashing wails of some sort of otherworldly creature. The noise rattled the air around him, and then gave way to a man’s shouting. And was that... music? What the hell happened? He was totally alone in a dark, curving hallway, both ends of which were obscured by turns. Coming from one direction was the sound of screaming. From the other, silence. This is how a hunter’s instincts can get you in trouble, Sam thought as he slowly stood, his legs faltering, and walked carefully toward the maelstrom. Most people would run away from screaming. Thanks for the death wish, Dad.</p><p>As he rounded the corner, he started at the sight before him. His brother, clearly in a similar state of shock, stood in the flickering light of an old-fashioned movie theater. On the silver screen, a massive squid attacked a submarine while sailors threw harpoons at its colossal eye. Sam reached way back into his childhood memories. The Nautilus? Is that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea? Sam was stupefied. What did Don do to us?</p><p>He saw an exit sign and pushed his stupefied older brother toward it. They stumbled outside and squinted as the afternoon sun temporarily blinded them. Blinking, Sam looked up at the impossibly bright sky and saw the silhouette of a massive building. The Empire State Building, he thought. A classic cherry-colored car motored past them, in pristine condition. Happy families strode down the sidewalk, wearing outfits straight out of Back to the Future. Sam stared at them. Something’s gone really wrong.</p><p>He looked over at Dean, who looked back at him, an I-told-you-so look on his face.</p><p>“Dude. I think that dick sent us back to 1954.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The time-travelers stood on the sidewalk, completely stunned. A crowd of women in full skirts, hats and gloves, and men in sharp suits and derbies flowed around them. In their Levi’s and leather jackets, Dean realized the Winchester boys looked out of place in the smart corporate landscape, to say the least.</p><p>That winged chimp really has sent us back to what looks like New York in 1954, he thought, his brain struggling to process. It seemed Don had dropped them smack dab in the middle of Times Square, but there wasn’t a camera-wielding tourist anywhere in sight. The place was also suspiciously clean and quiet, no crumpled piles of paper or garbage, and no blaring rap music emanating from any of the stores nearby.</p><p>“First, we get our bearings, then I beat your ass,” Dean announced.</p><p>“I didn’t—“ Sam began.</p><p>“Don’t, Sam. Nothing you can possibly say will make up for you throwing us under the bus, again.”</p><p>“You’re not the only one with a stake in this, Dean. That means, sometimes, you follow my plan.”</p><p>Dean scanned the bustling crowd, wary of continuing this discussion in public.</p><p>“Alright, smarty-pants. You wanted to do the time warp again, so what’s the next move?”</p><p>“We get off the street.”</p><p>On that point, Dean had to agree with his brother. Trying their best to blend into the crowd, they quickly turned and headed north toward Central Park.</p><p>Dean deftly grabbed a New York Herald Tribune from a green newsstand that squatted on the corner of 47^th^ and Broadway. Some things don’t change, no matter what era you are in; sleight of hand is still sleight of hand. Dean peered at the date: June 26^th^, 1954. He shook his head. That asshole had shot them back almost half a century without even an explanation of where or how to find the War Scroll.</p><p>Despite their predicament, Sam was smiling.</p><p>“This is amazing,” he said.</p><p>“What are you, Buddy the Elf, fresh from the North Pole?” Dean chided. “We’ve been to New York a dozen times.”</p><p>“Yeah, but how many times have we been to the fifties?” Sam retorted.</p><p>“The real fun starts in the sixties.”</p><p>As they crossed a busy intersection, a man in a trench coat clipped Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hey, watch it buddy,” Dean said with automatic vitriol, but when he looked at the guy, for a half-second he thought he saw the face of Castiel. The man looked up in alarm, and Dean realized his mistake. It wasn’t Cass, and they didn’t know anyone in 1954. There wasn’t a friendly face for miles, or decades for that matter.</p><p>The boys were no strangers to angelic time jumps—they had been through this before, when Anna tried to kill John and Mary Winchester in 1978, and when Cass took Dean back to 1973. The past wasn’t something Dean liked to visit or even remember, and now he was back. Plus, he was super hungry—another drawback to time travel.</p><p>Sam looked over his shoulder at the man in the trench coat, and then back at Dean.</p><p>“Dude, this isn’t the New York we’re familiar with. Try to be a little less conspicuous.”</p><p>As they left Times Square, Sam took one last look. Rather than the giant three-story-high video screens back in the present day, the streets were lined with theaters and coffee shops. The iconic signs that had made the square famous were mazes of neon. A two-story-high Pepsi Cola bottle-cap sign mooned over the square, which was filled not with mid-western tourists in fanny packs, but a vital post-war workforce eager to create the American dream. The fifties saw the beginning of the consumer society that perpetuated after World War II; buying things created a wealthy America, and the indications were all around them. A Chevrolet sign topped a building, under which was a Canadian Club Scotch Whiskey sign, and below that was the large-toothed smiling face of Ed Sullivan, hanging off the side of the building in front of them.</p><p>Sam grabbed Dean’s arm.</p><p>“We could go see The Ed Sullivan Show!”</p><p>Dean looked at his brother scornfully.</p><p>“Sam, I’m not hanging around here playing Mad Men with you. We get the page from those scrolls, and somehow have Don get us back to 2010. Nothing else.”</p><p>“I just thought we could take in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see living legends... living.”</p><p>Dean made his way up Broadway, and Sam followed a few steps behind. Dean took a right at 55^th^ Street, and he seemed to know exactly where he was headed as he crossed the street, dodging in between cars. Good thing there are no jaywalking tickets in the 1950s, Sam mused.</p><p>Dean pushed in the door to the Carnegie Deli and Sam dutifully followed him inside, knowing there was no point in resisting his brother’s appetite.</p><p>They slid into a booth looking out onto 7^th^ Avenue. Dean didn’t need to look at a menu; this was the only place in the whole wide world where Dean’s favorite thing diverged from his usual bacon cheeseburger. A waitress appeared at their table in a full pink skirt edged with white bric-a-brac.</p><p>“What can I get you gentlemen?” she asked with a heavy New York accent.</p><p>Dean smiled for the first time that day.</p><p>“I’ll have a pastrami on rye, extra mustard, potato salad, and a root beer, please.”</p><p>Sam shook his head. Nothing makes Dean happier than a meal. He looked up from his menu.</p><p>“I’ll have the turkey Reuben, light on the Russian dressing, and a side of coleslaw,” he said. The waitress nodded and scribbled on her pad.</p><p>“Comin’ right up,” she said and smiled as she left to place the order.</p><p>Once she was out of earshot, Dean looked expectantly at his brother.</p><p>“Alright, captain. What’s the plan?”</p><p>Sam had been pondering their next move, but hadn’t come up with any bright ideas yet. They knew very little about the location of the War Scroll, only what was publicly available on the internet in 2010. What they did know was that a private sale happened at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on July 1^st^ —in just five days. But how would they even get close to infiltrating that transaction?</p><p>“Well, we could try to get jobs at the Waldorf,” he said. “We wouldn’t call any attention to ourselves if we actually worked there.”</p><p>Dean shrugged. Getting a real job wasn’t their usual process, mostly they just pretended to be FBI agents, or priests, or CDC inspectors. Doing actual work wasn’t part of Dean’s modus operandi. But, considering the circumstances, they didn’t have a choice. They didn’t know nearly enough about the time period to successfully pass as government officials.</p><p>Their sandwiches arrived, five inches of beautiful meat piled onto freshly baked bread. Dean was beside himself with joy.</p><p>Minutes later, Dean was finishing up his pickle and the last bite of his sandwich. As they got up to leave, Dean looked at the check and pulled a ten spot out of his pocket. They walked past the young waitress on their way out.</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said, giving her a big smile.</p><p>She coyly lilted back. “No, thank you.”</p><p>Dean pulled open the door of the deli and looked back to smile smugly at Sam.</p><p>“Looks like Betty Draper has a thing for me.”</p><p>“You’re gonna wanna run, Dean,” Sam said with an equally smug look.</p><p>Dean looked at him questioningly. Then they heard a woman’s voice yelling after them.</p><p>“Stop those men!”</p><p>They looked back at the waitress, who was holding the very modern ten dollar bill Dean had just put down.</p><p>Without a second thought, Sam bolted down the street with Dean a step behind him. They dodged through stalled traffic at the intersection, nearly causing a pile-up when the light turned green.</p><p>Moments later they were casually sauntering east on 54^th^ Street.</p><p>“To the Waldorf?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Guess so,” Sam replied. He took out his BlackBerry, intending to Google the hotel’s location. Instead, he stared at the mess of jumbled pixels on the phone’s LCD. Not only would it have no signal in the fifties, the phone’s hardware had been damaged. Either time travel does a job on electronics, or it broke in the fall, he sumised. He quickly put it back in his pocket, not wanting to draw any more attention to them with his anachronistic device.</p><p>“Hey, what time is it?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know, my phone’s useless,” Sam answered.</p><p>“Yeah, mine too. Won’t turn on.”</p><p>Sam shielded his eyes and looked up at the sun.</p><p>“Maybe an hour till sunset,” he said. “On second thought, let’s find a place to crash first. I don’t know if it was the time travel or the dine-and-dash, but—“</p><p>“But little Sammy could use a nap?” Dean quipped.</p><p>“Take a look in the mirror,” Sam replied. “The bags under your eyes have bags under their eyes.”</p><p>“And whose fault is that? You think maybe all of your shenanigans are finally taking their toll on me?”</p><p>The brothers continued to bicker until they passed a block of pre-war apartments called the Villard Houses. A sign in front advertised a ‘vacency,’ which Sam figured was close enough, and they strolled into the building and up to apartment 3E.</p><p>An old woman answered the door, and directed them to take a look at the apartment across the hall. It had clearly once been part of a larger penthouse, but had been walled off into a smaller dwelling with a half kitchen, bedroom and adjoining living room. After years of living in dilapidated motels and the backseat of the Impala, the boys weren’t picky. With literally no money to their names—at least any they could actually use—Dean asked the landlady if he could give her the rent at the end of the week. She agreed; she just needed their names. They offered up two aliases. Sam was so tired that he couldn’t even place which band they said they came from.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Winchesters, the one thing the apartment didn’t have was a bed.</p><p>“Couldn’t we have just stayed at the Waldorf?” Dean said grumpily.</p><p>“You think they’d let us pay at the end of the week, genius?” Sam replied. Before Dean could respond, Sam went to the bathroom. He climbed into the claw-footed bathtub and rolled his coat underneath his head. It wasn’t nearly big enough for him, but he didn’t care.</p><p>Within a minute, he was asleep.</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Barney Doyle’s back was killing him. Most boys his age were learning to drive, dating girls, and having fun, but that wasn’t a possibility for Barney. His mother had been taken ill, forcing the fifteen year-old to find a job and take responsibility for her care.</p><p>There weren’t any grown men left in the Doyle’s Breezy Point, Queens house—just Barney and his mother. His father had passed away three years before, so when his uncle James had said that there was an opening for another security guard at the Waldorf Astoria, Barney’s mother believed it was a sign from Heaven. She was Catholic, of course, and she took her brother’s news as an answer to her prayers.</p><p>Although he normally hated his job, Barney had been looking forward to today. He and his uncle had taken one of the hotel’s trucks and were on their way over to Red Hook to pick up a box that had been shipped over from Israel, or someplace equally exotic.</p><p>Barney hadn’t paid much attention while he was still in school, so he wasn’t quite sure where Israel even was. He knew that it was a new country, and was somehow controversial, especially with his mother. Barney wished he had been better about his studies, not that it mattered now. He was stuck in this job and as far as he could see you didn’t need much learning to be a security guard.</p><p>When James and Barney arrived at the Red Hook Docks, a worker signaled for them to park at dock thirty-six. The truck bumped its way over the pier. They waited. The diesel engine was spewing exhaust almost directly into the cab, but Barney didn’t mind. This was a nice change from the boredom of the hotel.</p><p>A large burly guy in a white T-shirt banged his fist on the front of the truck.</p><p>“You guys from the Waldorf?”</p><p>James pulled his heft out of the truck to answer the guy face-to-face.</p><p>“Sure are.”</p><p>“Sign here,” the burly guy said as he shoved a clipboard at James. He signed without reading the form.</p><p>Handing it back, he asked, “Where is it?”</p><p>The burly guy motioned behind him.</p><p>“Carton five. Says it’s extremely fragile.” he replied, then walked away.</p><p>Barney leapt out of the truck to help his uncle with the carton. It was about four feet by two feet wide, made of fresh pine. The pungent tar smell tickled Barney’s nose as he bent down to inspect the roughly hewn container.</p><p>“Stop dicking around and help me get it into the truck,” James growled as he attempted to get his short arms around the base. Barney complied, hastily grabbing hold of his end. “Lift up your side more,” his uncle said.</p><p>“I am lifting,” Barney replied, watching as his uncle struggled to negotiate the carton over his stomach. His side was already much higher than James’s on account of his height, plus he wasn’t nearly as tubby.</p><p>Holding the container awkwardly between them, they managed to crab walk around to the back of the truck and the closed back doors.</p><p>“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Why didn’t you open the doors beforehand?” James demanded, breathing heavily.</p><p>“‘Cause you didn’t tell me to,” Barney said, staring at his uncle.</p><p>“Well, put your side down first and open the door.”</p><p>Barney squatted, holding his side of the carton. As he got it to knee height, his uncle’s grip faltered. The shift in weight distribution caused Barney to lose his hold, and the corner of the wooden crate hit the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p>Barney looked up in shock as his uncle swore at the top of his lungs. As he made the sign of the cross over his chest, James simultaneously cursed Barney to Hell.</p><p>Barney blushed a deep scarlet. “It’s fine, Uncle James. Let’s check it. I’m sure it’s fine.”</p><p>They pried a corner of the carton up, and Barney saw that the contents were packed densely with hay. James pushed Barney out of the way and with one hand pulled the rest of the top off. Stuffing his pudgy hand into the hay, he revealed a clay pot. It was tall, burnt orange in color, with a good bit of dirt on it. James wiped away more of the hay, and revealed three more jars.</p><p>As James inspected the first jar, its cover slid off the top and onto the ground, landing with a heavy crack. A strange, putrid smell emanated from the urn, which reminded Barney of the stench when the pilot light on their gas oven went out.</p><p>When his uncle opened his mouth, Barney readied himself, sure that his uncle was going to berate him, despite the accident being his fault. However, before James could start yelling, the oddest thing happened—he choked. It was as if he was vomiting in reverse, with oily bursts of black smoke flying into his mouth and down his throat.</p><p>Barney gaped as his uncle reached out toward him, and then everything went dark.</p><p>Sam and Dean sat on a hard fake leather couch outside the Waldorf’s general manager’s office. The rickety side table next to Dean was piled with magazines. He slid one off the top and showed it to Sam.</p><p>“Yum. Eva Marie Saint.” Dean leered at the picture of the young starlet with her blonde hair swept back, very nicely filling out a blue sweater. “From TV stardom to the movie Waterfront,” Dean said, reading off the cover.</p><p>“She’s an old woman.” Sam said, rolling his eyes at his brother’s incredible capacity for horniness.</p><p>“Not now she isn’t.” Dean almost jumped in excitement. “Marilyn, I want to meet Marilyn, do you think she stays here?”</p><p>“We didn’t travel over five decades back in time so you could sleep with a couple of starlets,” Sam replied.</p><p>Dean furrowed his brow. “It wasn’t my idea to travel here, period. Besides, these women are icons, Sam. Completely different. If we have any free time after we nick the War Scroll, I’m going to find Marilyn.”</p><p>“Okay, Dean.” Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Sam and Dean Winchester?”</p><p>Dean flinched at the sound of his own name before quickly remembering that Sam had given it to the receptionist when they applied. Apparently, being this far removed from their own time meant that caution could be thrown out the window.</p><p>The man who had spoken wore a three-piece suit and was holding open a door that lead into an interior office.</p><p>“I’m Ernest Harold, General Support Manager at the Waldorf. Please come in.” The man graciously swept his hand toward his office.</p><p>Sam and Dean settled into a couple of leather chairs on one side of the man’s very messy desk.</p><p>“Terribly sorry about the clutter,” Mr. Harold said, shuffling some papers around. “I have 200 employees to oversee and I can’t seem to manage all the paperwork. As you know, this is a prestigious establishment, with a rich history of providing impeccable accommodations to the most discerning travelers, statesmen and royalty throughout the world.”</p><p>“And Marilyn Monroe,” Dean offered.</p><p>Mr. Harold frowned. “The privacy of our clients is of the utmost importance in this position. You will work closely with people that you see on the silver screen every day. We do not allow any... fraternizing with the hotel’s guests.”</p><p>“Of course not.” Sam leaned forward. “We completely understand. My brother is a fan, but he’s a very reserved fan. Aren’t you, Dean?”</p><p>Dean smiled tightly. “Yes. Haven’t fraternized in months, myself.”</p><p>“Of course. So, tell me a little about yourselves,” Mr. Harold said, leaning back in his chair. “Whatever you would like to share.”</p><p>This struck Dean as sort of funny—What could they possibly share with this over-stuffy dope? He decided to be straightforward.</p><p>“Sir. Mr. Harold—Ernest. My brother and I are new in town. And, frankly, we don’t have any money. But we are hard-working, strong, and charming. We can do anything you need us to.”</p><p>The dude seemed to be impressed.</p><p>“You remind me of someone,” he said, peering at Dean. “Have you been to the pictures and seen On the Waterfront yet?”</p><p>Dean leaned back, smiling. “Classic Brando.”</p><p>“Classic? He’s a very new actor. At least, I believe he is.” Ernest looked confused.</p><p>Dean stuttered hastily. “I meant to say a new, classic-looking actor.”</p><p>“Ahh, you’re right. I do love a good picture.” Ernest swept his hair out of his eyes, then turned his attention to Sam. “And you.”</p><p>“I’ll do whatever you need me to do, sir,” Sam said.</p><p>“Well, you both are fine fellows.” Ernest got up and moved around his desk. “But I have only one position available. Congratulations, Mr. Winchester.” He stuck his hand out toward Dean.</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Dean said with a smile as they shook hands. “You won’t regret it.”</p><p>“I’m sure I won’t. Go see Mable in uniforms. She’ll set you up. I have paperwork for you to fill out, but we can do that later. I expect you’ll make about twenty dollars in tips—“</p><p>Dean nodded. “Not bad.”</p><p>“—a week,” Ernest finished.</p><p>He shuffled them out the door.</p><p>“Go up these stairs and all the way to the end of the hall. And Sam. Might I suggest you get a haircut? This isn’t Amsterdam.”</p><p>For Dean, it was the perfect end to a perfect interview.</p><p>“Sorry Sammy, guess you’re too European to work this town. Maybe try again in the 1970s.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I’m going to the public library to see what I can find. Besides, I think you’re better cut out for this part of the plan. You know, the mindless labor.”</p><p>Dean nodded proudly and disappeared into a door marked “Uniforms.”</p><p>Sam’s immediate concern was to find someone in the city who could translate the scrolls. Without Bobby as a resource, and with all of their lore books sitting in the Impala’s trunk back in 2010, it would be nearly impossible for Sam to do the translating himself. Not that I’m entirely sure what language they’ll be written in. Thinking things through, he realized that they were going to need some heavy-duty artillery—it was unlikely the scrolls’ owner would hand them over without a fight. Anyway, Sam felt naked without a firearm.</p><p>While Sam was contemplating that dilemma, Dean appeared in the doorway wearing a burgundy wool bellhop jacket with golden rope tassels hanging from the sides and gleaming brass buttons down the front. A petit fez perched on his head, with a braided, golden chinstrap pinching his scowling face.</p><p>Sam smirked.</p><p>Dean stepped past him.</p><p>“Don’t say anything.”</p><p>That afternoon, Dean found himself lugging a seemingly endless stream of leather suitcases up to various different guests’ rooms. He quickly bonded with Rick, the African-American elevator operator, and they were soon discussing baseball as Dean rode between floors.</p><p>After a particularly heavy set of bags, Dean was not-so-attentively leaning against the lobby’s centerpiece—a large, statuesque clock trimmed in gold leaf—when a girl who looked to be in her mid-twenties approached the front desk. She was wearing a royal blue suit with a pencil skirt, and a pillbox hat that matched her canary-yellow shoes. A cabbie brought a suitcase in and dropped it at her feet. She tipped him elegantly and he bowed his head before heading back outside.</p><p>“Ms. Julia Wilder checking in, please,” she said to the receptionist. Her brunette hair was pulled back, and Dean noticed with surprise a long scar on the side of her neck.</p><p>The young woman turned her head toward Dean, looking him up and down. Her glare was so intense that Dean felt as though she’d just given him the third degree without even speaking a word. She turned her head back to the front desk and demurely pulled her hair over the scar. Dean kept staring, transfixed by her lithe but strong legs and her serious demeanor. She’s hot, he thought. Maybe I won’t have to track down Marilyn after all.</p><p>Dean sidled up to her, completely forgetting he was supposed to be working.</p><p>“Hi,” he said giving her the full-on hundred-watt Dean Winchester smile.</p><p>The girl ignored him. Had she known more about Dean, she wouldn’t have bothered.</p><p>“You here for business or pleasure?” he asked. “Or just to see the big clock?”</p><p>She looked at him. “May I help you?”</p><p>“No. But I could help you,” Dean whispered. “Maybe I could buy you a drink?”</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“You here with your husband?” Dean probed.</p><p>“I’m not here to socialize. I’m here for an auction.”</p><p>“Dead Sea Scrolls?” Dean asked without thinking.</p><p>She squinted at him.</p><p>“No,” she said.</p><p>“Excuse me, boy,” interjected the desk clerk. “Are you going to get the lady’s bags?” He eyed Dean with venom.</p><p>“Of course.” Dean bent down, but before he could grab the suitcase, Stevie, a smelly kid from New Jersey who wore his bellhop pants a little too tight in Dean’s opinion, swiped the bag and placed it on a cart. He wheeled away, Ms. Wilder striding behind him.</p><p>Dean stood by the reception desk shell-shocked, though still alert enough to salute when Ms. Wilder turned to take one last look at him before entering the elevator. It was rare for a woman to truly grab his attention as she had. Of course, he’d faked interest plenty of times; it used to be a hobby of his while he and Sam were in between cases. Dean would bet himself just how many minutes it would take him to convince the bartender, waitress, or lonely female patron into his bed. Dean’s belt notches were many. But this girl... this girl seemed special.</p><p>Not far away, Sam sat in the main branch of the New York Public Library. Rows of shelves lined every inch of the room; thousands upon thousands of books, and not an Internet connection in sight. Sam didn’t mind doing the research, but Google had become his crutch, and he felt handicapped without it.</p><p>First he pulled a series of books on archeological digs, but found very little information. After trawling through the card catalog, he decided to look at the archived New York newspapers. The scrolls, Sam remembered, had been first discovered in 1947, so there must be at least one article somewhere that could lead them to a contact. After fruitlessly pouring over several months’ worth of broadsheets, Sam was flipping through a June 1^th^Wall Street Journal when he spotted a small ad in the classified section:</p><p>Four Dead Sea Scrolls, Biblical Manuscripts. Would make an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution.</p><p>The ad gave a local number and an address, which Sam jotted down on a scrap of paper and slipped in his pocket. That was as solid a lead as he was going to find on the scrolls themselves—now they just needed a translator. He wished that Don had briefed them a little more thoroughly before the unceremonious time-jacking. Sam regretted going behind Dean’s back to talk to the angel, but at the time, there seemed to be no other choice. The secret fear that Sam had been carrying around since they got to 1954 was that they would never find their way back. What if they were unable to procure the War Scroll—would Don just leave them to rot?</p><p>Without occult books to refer to, Sam was limited to commonly available biblical texts. I don’t even know Don’s real name, Sam realized. All I know is his job description: guardian of Hell’s gates.</p><p>Luckily, that was all he needed.</p><p>Flipping through an especially old book, Sam found a list of angel names and one in particular stuck out: Abaddon, Guardian of the Gates. Don, Abaddon—has to be the same guy, Sam thought. Further down the page, the book traced Abaddon’s motley history. Scholars couldn’t seem to decide on the angel’s true nature, some believed that he was among the most powerful of the Heavenly Host, others claimed he was fallen and in league with Satan. In fact, in some places, Abaddon was used as an alternate name for Hell, and even the Devil himself. Great, Sam thought.</p><p>For the moment, Sam decided that he wouldn’t share those particular juicy details with Dean. I’m in enough hot water with him as it is, he figured. But, to be safe, he discreetly tore the relevant page out of the book and slid it into his pocket, alongside the scrap of paper with the information from the advert. If it turned out that Don had less than angelic intentions, Sam wanted to be ready.</p><p>Dean tugged at the chinstrap on his hat. He needed a break. Mercifully, the lobby was quiet and the dickhead front desk guys were engrossed in their work. He made his way downstairs and threaded his way through the halls under the building, finally reaching a set of steel doors. Throwing caution to the wind, he swung them open.</p><p>A hotel security guard stood on the other side with his back to Dean, and a box truck idled outside the loading dock. The man was tubby and middle-aged. He turned around slowly, looking as if he’d been caught committing a crime.</p><p>Dean politely nodded a greeting. “Guess I’m lost,” he said. “Where’s the little boys’ room?”</p><p>Instead of answering out loud, the man simply pointed back the way Dean had come.</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. He was about to call off his reconnaissance mission, when he saw what the security guard had been hovering over—it was a simple wooden crate, damaged on one end, covered in strange characters. Probably worth getting a better look at, Dean decided. “Actually... I think I can hold it,” he said. “I’m gonna get some fresh air.”</p><p>Under the guard’s watchful eye, Dean maneuvered his way past the crate and to the edge of the loading dock, but he wasn’t able to get a better look at the contents. Damn security goon and his thighs, Dean thought. He jumped off the loading dock and walked down the alleyway, rounding the corner onto Park Avenue, then stopped.</p><p>Hebrew? Could the lettering have been Hebrew? By pure chance, he may have just come impossibly close to the scrolls, and he couldn’t pass up such an opportunity—even if that meant beating the ass of a civilian. He turned around and started back to the loading dock.</p><p>James peered inside the truck. Barney’s crumpled body was pushed to one side on the floor, his neck twisted at an unnatural angle. The sight of his nephew’s corpse prompted no reaction in James. If anything did, it was the smell. Meat, James thought. Still fresh.</p><p>James turned and grabbed a black rubber hose attached to a waterspout. He turned on the water and sprayed down the inside of the truck. The water ran pink as it flowed out and over the bumper. He turned off the hose and pulled Barney’s body onto the dock. Then he picked the body up easily with one hand, opened the top of the crate and pushed it inside.</p><p>Clunking the crate closed, James wheeled the carton into the back of the Waldorf Astoria.</p><p>It’s still safe, he thought with pride. She’ll be pleased with me.</p><p>Holding onto his stupid bellhop hat, Dean hurried back down the alleyway. He slid back around the corner just as James disappeared into the hotel. With finesse, he jumped onto the dock and banged through the steel doors.</p><p>The security guard and the carton were gone.</p><p>After a couple more unproductive hours at the library, Sam decided to stop off at the new apartment; he wanted to call Dean. As he fiddled with the key in the lock, he noticed out of the corner of his eye one of their neighbors walking toward him down the hallway. He half-nodded a greeting as the young woman brushed past him in the narrow corridor, briefly glancing up to admire her petite dark-haired figure as she moved away from him, before carrying on fiddling with the stubborn lock.</p><p>Finally there was a click as the key connected with the mechanism and Sam managed to get the door open. By this point his mind had wandered far from the mission at hand to fantasies about living a normal life—one that held room for girls and movie dates and romantic dinners. It all came crashing back as he took in the sight before him. The apartment had been completely ransacked.</p><p>Sam wondered how, after being in 1954 for less than twenty-four hours, he and Dean had already made an enemy.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>No sulphur, Sam noted, sniffing the air. It wasn’t a demon.</p><p>He kicked at the shards of glass that littered the scummy tile floor of the apartment’s tiny bathroom. The intruder had been thorough, upending or smashing just about every object in the small space that wasn’t built into the floor. They even smashed the toilet, Sam realized. The bathroom mirror had also been broken, which accounted for all the glass on the floor. Just what we need, he thought, more bad luck. Sam closed the water valve leading to the sputtering half-toilet.</p><p>It wasn’t like there was much to steal. They had been whisked through time with only the clothes on their backs and the contents of their pockets. Who had done this? Were there angels here too? Sam wondered, a nervous chill running through him.</p><p>He felt helpless. Lost in an unfamiliar time and place, with all his usual tools unavailable to him, and the end of the world in sight. Because of me, he remembered. I did this.My fear, my weakness, brought on the end for everybody. In these moments, when the guilt overwhelmed him, and images of the billions who would die filled his mind, Sam craved the blood. It didn’t make any sense. Demon blood had given him strength, but it had also clouded his judgment. It had made him turn his back on Dean, the only person who could ever truly understand Sam’s situation.</p><p>It had made him start the Apocalypse.</p><p>Despite all of that, Sam craved it for one simple reason: it made him feel powerful. The demon blood unlocked something deep within him, something that had been left there by Azazel, the yellow-eyed demon who had killed their mother, Mary Winchester, and marked Sam as part of his growing army of special, part-demonic children. Sam was the only one left alive. Was that why I was chosen to be Lucifer’s vessel? Because Azazel made me this way? Because I was the most special of the special? Or simply because I survived?</p><p>Sam moved cautiously back to the main room, pushing those uncomfortable thoughts from his mind. The lock on the front door didn’t show any signs of being forced, though it had been difficult to open. Sam was definitely paranoid enough to have checked the locks in both the door’s handle and the deadbolt when he left a few hours earlier. He scanned the main room of the apartment for other entry points. There was a small, metal-barred window overlooking the street.</p><p>Looking down, Sam saw the bustle of a New York street at midday. The window was high enough up that it would take a ladder and some patience to get to it, making it unlikely someone would be able to break in without attracting attention. Not that Sam was sure the good people of New York would bat an eyelash at broad-daylight larceny, but the window’s metal bars were still firmly in place.</p><p>Attached to the main room was a small kitchenette, much like the ones in motels that the Winchesters had become intimately familiar with over the last few years. Scratch that, Sam thought, I’ve become familiar with. Dean never, ever cooked... unless you counted assembling bread and shoplifted deli meat as cooking. Even when they were kids and Dean was ostensibly the caretaker, Sam had had to fend for himself.</p><p>Inside the kitchenette was a window, taller than the one in the living room, and covered by a garish red curtain. Pushing the curtain aside, Sam saw the rusted metal of a fire escape. Mystery solved.</p><p>Put bars on the inaccessible window, but don’t even put a lock on the fire escape? Different time, Sam thought. The question now was the motivation for the break-in. Sam and Dean didn’t look rich, or important. Could someone already know about us? About our mission here?</p><p>Sam briefly considered keeping the burglary to himself and avoiding Dean’s inevitable freak-out. The boys had spent a considerable portion of their time together on the run—from law enforcement, vampires, shapeshifters, demons, Hellhounds... and now the forces of Heaven. Knowing they were being followed after less than a day in 1954 wasn’t going to go over well.</p><p>Sam reached for his BlackBerry, realizing again as he did so that it wouldn’t work. Living without technology is a bitch. How did Don Draper do it? But calling Dean wouldn’t have been an option anyway, since his BlackBerry wasn’t in his pocket.</p><p>It was the one thing he had left in the rented apartment, knowing that it would be useless in 1954. Stupid, he berated himself. It was a rookie mistake, one his father would never have made. Sam checked his other pockets, finding his wallet intact alongside a pack of gum. Reaching into his jacket pocket, Sam’s heart sank. Something else was missing, and it was a much bigger deal than a useless cell phone.</p><p>Ruby’s knife.</p><p>The one weapon the boys had had with them had vanished from the inside pocket of Sam’s jacket somewhere between the library and the apartment. It was, as far as Sam and Dean knew, one of a kind.</p><p>And now it was gone.</p><p>Dean may not have been the smartest Winchester, and he certainly wasn’t the one you wanted to help translate an ancient document, but after years of digging through yellowed lore books, he had picked up a few things. He knew, for example, that when he saw crazy-ass lettering, he was better off calling Sam than trying to figure it out himself. Dean figured his value came more from his ‘give ‘em hell’ attitude than from his G.E.D.</p><p>The symbols on the side of the crate certainly fell into the ‘crazy-ass’ category. Was it Hebrew, or something older? A crate with biblical text on it getting dropped off at the Waldorf? This is almost too easy, Dean thought. All he had to do was follow it to its destination, grab the scroll, and get clear of the place before any more hot girls saw him in his embarrassing monkey suit.</p><p>Trouble was, Dean had already lost the crate. The workman who had delivered it must have slipped into the service elevator while Dean was sorting all of this out in his head.</p><p>He hurried along the loading dock to the service elevator’s oversized doors. As he reached out to press the ‘down’ button, assuming that’s where the crate was headed, the doors sprang open.</p><p>“A lot of guests need their luggage taken to the loading dock?” asked the mustached man who was waiting in the elevator. Dean recognized him as one of the asshole desk clerks from upstairs.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, lady wanted to see the...” Dean trailed off, looking around the poorly lit dock for anything that could possibly interest a guest, “the place where we keep the carts.” He gestured weakly toward a line of derelict luggage carts parked in the corner.</p><p>The clerk stared hard at Dean for an excruciatingly long moment, then cracked a wry smile.</p><p>“Kind of an unspoken rule that we wait until our shift’s over, buddy,” the man said, patting Dean on the back. “If a lady wants to see your, uh, cart, she’ll still wanna see it after you’re done working.” He pulled Dean into the elevator by the shoulder, but Dean resisted.</p><p>“Maybe give me a minute here?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You got a phone call. Your dad.”</p><p>Dean shrugged the man’s hand off his shoulder and forced open the closing elevator doors. John Winchester had been dead for years, or, depending on how you looked at it, was not even born yet.</p><p>“My what?” Dean demanded, suddenly deadly serious.</p><p>“Or brother? Or your cousin? I don’t know. Some guy. Sounded kind of annoyed. And annoying, for that matter.” The man pulled Dean’s hand off the elevator door, which continued to close. “And here’s a pro tip. Don’t actually try anything on those carts. You’ll end up rolling all over the place, the lady will bonk her head, and it’ll be all tears and whining for the rest of the night. Trust me.”</p><p>It wasn’t a dignified position to be in, but Sam didn’t have a choice. He was on his hands and knees, clawing around the base of the phone booth for dropped change. He had only had a few coins, and Dean was taking his sweet time to get to the phone. Probably got distracted, Sam thought. If he’s with a woman...</p><p>“Sam, that you?” a voice sounded through the phone.</p><p>“Dean! I’ve been waiting a—“</p><p>“Yeah, ‘bout that, couldn’t you have waited a little longer to check in on me, Mom? Made me lose a lead on our scrolls.”</p><p>“I’m not checking in,” Sam said, aggravated. “I thought you’d want to know we got robbed.”</p><p>“We? I didn’t get robbed. All I own here is this stupid hat, and I sure as hell still have that.”</p><p>“Our apartment was broken into—“</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They tore the place apart.” Sam started to pace with the phone, then realized there was only a foot of space for him to move either way in the booth. He suddenly understood why cordless phones had been invented.</p><p>“Calm down, big guy. You sound a little pissed.” Dean said, lowering his voice.</p><p>“They took... my BlackBerry.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s rough Sammy,” Dean said, obviously faking sympathy. “Seriously though, who the hell cares? Who you planning on texting in 1954?”</p><p>“You don’t get it,” Sam responded. “They took my 2010 phone, full of 2010 technology, meaning we could have a serious Back to the Future II situation.”</p><p>“What, so Biff is going to steal our Delorean?”</p><p>“No, we could seriously alter the timeline. Introduce things now that aren’t supposed to exist for decades—“</p><p>“Am I gonna have to kiss Mom?” Dean said, his smirk evident even over the phone.</p><p>“Dean.” Sam knew he had to break Dean out of his streak or he was going to be hearing Marty McFly jokes for the rest of the day. “Please.”</p><p>“Fine. Remember what Cass told me, though—whatever we do, that’s what happened. We can’t change history, we can just live in it for a bit. We break something, it was always broken, that’s how it was—always.”</p><p>“Cass told you that because he was trying to prove a point. Why would Don send us back if we couldn’t change anything?” Sam asked. “If the scroll really was destroyed in 1954, we are going to change that.”</p><p>“Well don’t count on the d-bag coming by to clarify any of it.”</p><p>“There’s something else,” Sam admitted. “Whoever broke in was thorough. Not just a smash and grab job.”</p><p>“So they were motivated. Had something particular in mind,” Dean said.</p><p>“Could someone have overheard us, someone else who wants the scroll?”</p><p>Dean exhaled loudly. “This is gonna be harder than I thought.”</p><p>“In 2010, the last thing I loaded on the phone was the Wikipedia page for the scrolls. Probably no one will ever be able to recover it. But what if they can? What if there is someone out there—“</p><p>“Who is a technological genius fifty years ahead of their time, and also cares about the scrolls? I don’t think so,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam was silent. He knew he had to tell Dean the rest of the story, but couldn’t face letting his brother down. Finally, he gulped down a breath and bit the bullet.</p><p>“There’s one more thing that’s missing. Ruby’s knife.”</p><p>“Damn it, Sam—“</p><p>“I know,” Sam replied, trying to head off Dean’s inevitable tirade.</p><p>“You left the knife in the apartment? What were you thinking? I thought I was supposed to be the dumbass?”</p><p>“I didn’t leave it. Someone must have taken it off of me.”</p><p>“What, so now we have ninjas after us?” Dean asked, exasperated.</p><p>“There was this girl, in the hallway...” Sam trailed off, letting Dean’s imagination fill in the rest.</p><p>“That’s just perfect. I mean, we’ve been porked before, but this takes the cake.” Dean took a breath. “Sammy? You there?”</p><p>“Yeah, Dean. I’m here.”</p><p>“With or without the knife, we gotta move forward,” Dean said, then added in an undertone. “This crate I saw, it had a bunch of markings on it, I think in Hebrew.”</p><p>“Sounds right.”</p><p>“My point is, if the package is in Hebrew, imagine what language the scroll itself will be in—“</p><p>“You’re just thinking of that now?” Sam chided. “According to the books I found, similar texts from that region and time period were written in early Herodian square script, but that’s more the symbology than the language. The language would be Aramaic.”</p><p>“Save it, Dan Brown. My point is, how are we gonna read this thing?”</p><p>“I’m working on it,” Sam said. “Let’s worry about finding the scroll first.”</p><p>“Good chat, Sam,” his brother responded, an edge in his voice. “I’ll try to track down the scroll before the Hamburglar catches up with me. Try not to lose your pants.”</p><p>“Wait,” Sam spat out, “when are we meeting up?”</p><p>“Meet me back here when my shift ends. Eight o’clock.”</p><p>Sam heard Dean hang up.</p><p>He stepped out of the phone booth and back into the swirling storm of people outside. I guess Dean can handle himself for a few hours, Sam thought, turning south, away from the Waldorf and back toward the library.</p><p>Two hours later, Sam was no closer to speaking Aramaic. Being in one of the biggest libraries in the world, the texts were certainly available, but the language was far more complex than Sam had imagined. Without help, it could take months to get an accurate translation.</p><p>I wonder if Bobby knows Aramaic? It wasn’t that crazy a notion, since a large portion of the biblical lore books that Bobby studied were in ancient languages. Not that we have Bobby here, Sam thought. For a brief moment, he considered looking up the Singers in the phone book. Bobby was born in the fifties; it was possible that at that very moment an infant Bobby was first learning to scowl.</p><p>Sam again wished that he had gotten more information from Don before being sent back. What were they supposed to do once they found the War Scroll? Translate it in the past, or hide it Bill &amp; Ted-style for their future selves to find?</p><p>The boys didn’t often get a chance to plan ahead, so when the opportunity presented itself, Sam decided he was going to take it. He found a phone book in the lobby and used his last ten cents to call the American Bible Society—apparently it was home to the greatest concentration of biblical texts outside of the Vatican. It was as good a place to start as any.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The benefits of Dean’s job were manifold. The women he helped to their rooms were uniformly stunning, from which Dean surmised that even in 1954, enough money could buy you beauty. They were also generous. The twenty dollars a week the manager had quoted turned out to be on the very low end. Dean had no idea how much his tips could actually buy, but he imagined it was a lot. He wondered if most people knew such arcane facts—had Dean been out hunting demons on the school day when the kids learned about inflation rates?</p><p>The most obvious benefit to the job was access, but that was also the downside. He was tantalizingly close to the scrolls, but he was now under the close supervision of the more dickish of the two desk clerks. After several hours of work, he still hadn’t been able to venture down to the vault.</p><p>His opportunity came shortly after sunset, when the clerk finally left the front desk. Dean pushed his luggage cart into the elevator and asked Rick to leave it on the top floor, hoping that nobody would come looking for him this time. Slipping into the employees-only corridor that led away from the ornate lobby, Dean marveled at how quickly the hotel went from world-class to low-class. Water stains ran down the cheap wallpaper, bringing to mind the Winchesters’ usual stomping grounds. While Dean enjoyed the change of pace that the Waldorf represented, the drab familiarity of the hallway helped put him in hunting mode.</p><p>Not taking a chance on the service elevator being in use, Dean took the back stairwell. Calling it dank would be an understatement. The bare-bulb lighting was hardly enough to see by, but probably helped cover up the unfortunate state of the stairs themselves.</p><p>Toward the base of the stairwell, he heard a low scraping noise and slowed his pace. It sounded like something was being dragged across unfinished cement.</p><p>“My God, I...” intoned a man’s voice, before fading to a murmur. Glass clinked against glass, followed by the sound of a bottle slowly pouring out its contents.</p><p>Dean padded down a few more steps and craned his head around the corner. He was glad, for once, that Sam wasn’t stomping his heavy feet beside him. There were advantages to being the less muscle-bound Winchester. Despite that, the stair he was perched on felt less than stable.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to do it,” the man said, his voice full of quiet desperation. “You know I would never...”</p><p>Leaning forward as he listened for a reply, Dean nearly slipped off the crumbling concrete step, and pieces of the slab skittered downward. The voice stopped and moments later Dean heard feet pounding away from him. Crap, he swore under his breath, the noise had clearly spooked the man enough to send him running.</p><p>Dean slammed his shoulder through the doorway into the sub-basement hallway, sending a radiating pain through his arm that probably wouldn’t go away for a week. The man hadn’t gotten far, having slipped to the ground less than ten feet from the stairwell.</p><p>“Whaddaya doin’, trying to... ugh,” the man said, gulping down air. “Trying to give me a coronary?”</p><p>“Slow your roll, dude,” Dean answered as he approached. The man’s face was flush and covered in sweat, and Dean recognized him immediately as the guard who had brought the War Scroll crate into the Waldorf earlier. He also recognized the bottle of Wild Turkey that was upended and dripping onto the cement floor. “Hard day, I take it,” he said, leaning in to read the man’s ID badge. “Mr. McMannon?”</p><p>The man shuddered back a sob and lifted the bottle to his lips to swill down what hadn’t spilled.</p><p>Dean inclined his head at the sorry sight. “Been there.”</p><p>Was it possible that this mess of a guy was responsible for guarding the vault? If so, it was just a matter of keeping him acquainted with that bottle. Dean had no qualms about robbing a passed-out drunk.</p><p>“Hasn’t been a great few days for me, either. Hell, hasn’t been a great decade,” he said.</p><p>Lumbering to his feet, McMannon gave Dean a wary look.</p><p>“Decade just—“ he began, then hiccupped, “started.” Clearly, the guard wasn’t ready for a heart-to-heart with an intrusive bellhop.</p><p>Dean gave him his best car salesman grin.</p><p>“How ‘bout I get us another bottle?”</p><p>James McMannon was in control of himself for the time being. He couldn’t exactly recall how he had come to be in the sub-basement, or even what day it was, but at least he felt in control.</p><p>He watched the bellhop scurry back up the stairs to get another bottle. Something about the man—was it his smell?—was unsettling. James briefly considered killing him when he returned, but quickly banished the thought. Why would I do that? Why would I even think it? It was then that the image popped back into his mind: his nephew, Barney, head hanging like a rag doll’s, his eyes totally lifeless.</p><p>Where had he seen that? Was it a terrible dream? Deep down, a part of James knew that he had done an unspeakable thing—but that part of his brain was currently drowning in Bourbon. At any rate, it wasn’t James that had killed Barney; it was the strange animal living inside him, and that animal seemed to be, for the moment, asleep.</p><p>He shook his head to banish the strange thoughts. Now where was that kid with the new bottle of whiskey?</p><p>Paranoia was deeply ingrained in the hunter lifestyle, and Sam Winchester had been checking for tails since he was five years old. Walking through the maelstrom of mid-town Manhattan was proving to be unimaginably difficult for him, especially with the knowledge that he’d been followed once that day already.</p><p>Double back, wait a few minutes, then keep moving, Sam repeated to himself over and over. It was his father’s mantra, and it was clearly designed for small town America, not the overflowing streets of New York City.</p><p>The towering brick building that housed the American Bible Society was located at 57^th^ Street and Park Avenue, a few blocks north of the Waldorf. Sam had resisted the temptation to check in on his brother while walking past, but he was still feeling the frustration of living without a cell phone. He imagined Dean had already made another attempt to get near the scroll, but it would be a few hours before his shift was over and Sam could find out for sure.</p><p>Sam’s contact was waiting for him in the Society’s front lobby. He was a well-built man stuffed into a suit that was too small for him. His thin necktie accentuated the unflattering fit. His arm was in a canvas sling, leading Sam to wonder what sort of trouble the man had gotten himself into.</p><p>“Mr. Sawyer?” Sam asked.</p><p>The man nodded and gestured toward a set of chairs.</p><p>“Please, call me Walter. Have a seat. Can I get you a drink?”</p><p>Before Sam could respond, Walter dropped ice cubes into two tumblers and poured amber liquid into each one.</p><p>“I regret I couldn’t be more helpful on the telephone,” Walter said as he handed Sam his drink. “I’m not sure I understand what you’re looking for.”</p><p>“I’m not sure either, not yet. I’m in the process of buying a religious relic, something of family interest—“</p><p>“You’re Jewish?” Walter interrupted with a slight squint.</p><p>“No, it’s not... not that, exactly.”</p><p>Walter knocked back his drink absently, his attention fully on Sam.</p><p>“But you mentioned something about Hebrew relics, Old Testament manuscripts.” He paused for a moment, his eyes asking the obvious question. “If you don’t mind my asking, what’s the ‘family interest’?”</p><p>“In-laws,” Sam said with a shrug.</p><p>The scholar seemed to accept that, for the moment.</p><p>“And once you have acquired the documents, you’ll need them interpreted.”</p><p>“Translated,” Sam corrected. “I think biblical interpretation is best left to the individual.”</p><p>Walter pulled a crooked half-grin. “Fair enough.” He brushed a lock of his unkempt brown hair from his forehead. “Does this have something to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls?”</p><p>Sam was careful to keep his face neutral. “What do you know about the scrolls?” he asked.</p><p>“They’re the most important historical discovery of the century,” Walter said with precise, almost rehearsed diction, as if he had said it many times, to many people. “Any century, really. Though whether people accept that is a different matter entirely.”</p><p>“It’s not the first apocryphal Old Testament text,” Sam replied, studying Walter’s reaction.</p><p>“Apocryphal. What makes it any less relevant than Genesis or Revelations? Or Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, for that matter?” Walter spat with thinly veiled distaste.</p><p>“Have you read them? The scrolls?”</p><p>Walter didn’t respond immediately, instead he looked into Sam’s eyes as if he was passing judgment, determining whether he was worthy of sharing what he knew of the scrolls.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Sam forced a smile and took a sip from his very strong drink. Straight whiskey, he realized. At least it was afternoon. As he set the glass on the nearby end table, he noticed a red blot seeping across Walter’s canvas sling.</p><p>“Your arm alright?” he asked, indicating the bloody stain.</p><p>Walter glanced at it carelessly. “Ah. I should really be more careful on the subway,” he said, and stood up. “Let’s go to my office and talk about the scrolls.”</p><p>The sub-basement of the Waldorf Astoria was spinning around Dean Winchester. His head was rested against the cushion of a tall-back chair, his feet propped up on the security desk outside the hotel’s vault. His sobriety was long since gone.</p><p>“You think you’ve had a crap week, let me tell you something, James,” Dean said, gesturing wildly with an almost-empty bottle of vodka, the only liquor he had managed to swipe from the bar upstairs. “I come from... the future.”</p><p>For his part, James wasn’t listening to a word of Dean’s rant. He was far more than three sheets to the wind, his pudgy cheeks and eyes were both red, his eyelids drooping with exhaustion.</p><p>“The friggin’ future, man.”</p><p>James studied his hands intently, as if they were part of somebody else’s body.</p><p>“We have this thing, the internet, it’s like porno city. Anything you want. What are you into, man? Asians? They’ve got Asians,” Dean said with a knowing look. Boy did they have Asians.</p><p>James’s head drooped toward the floor. Dean, realizing that this was his moment, shut up and watched for any sign that James would snap out of it. Instead, he dropped to the floor entirely, his girth hitting the concrete with a slap.</p><p>“Gonna feel that tomorrow,” Dean said as he moved toward the vault door. In his inebriated state, he stumbled over James’s legs and nearly face-planted himself.</p><p>The vault was like that of a small bank, with a heavy combination-locked door which no doubt lead into a room full of safety deposit boxes. Dean knew that breaking into the main vault would be relatively straightforward—after all, he had a bit of experience in that regard—but finding the War Scroll inside might prove trickier. He’d seen James bringing the large crate in earlier, but he had no idea how big the scroll itself was, or whether it had been filed into an individually locked safety deposit box.</p><p>As he listened to the tumblers on the main door click into place, he heard James twitch on the floor. Poor bastard, Dean thought, seems like he’s got enough problems as it is. This ain’t gonnahelp. Not that Dean knew what James’s problem was, since he hadn’t been particularly chatty during their marathon drinking session.</p><p>After a few minutes, the heavy door swung open. All of Dean’s fears about finding the scroll were immediately relieved, as the center of the vault was filled with several large jars. They looked to be thousands of years old, and each was capped with a lid inscribed with symbols. Dean moved quickly toward them. He lifted the lid off the nearest jar, to find, to his surprise, a shape was carved onto the inside of the lid—a rudimentary Devil’s Trap. The holy symbol that could contain a demon.</p><p>Before Dean could react, a throaty growl sounded behind him.</p><p>James McMannon stood outside the vault, totally sober, his eyes jet black. While Dean took a heartbeat to consider how totally screwed he was, James charged.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Despite his considerable heft, James’s possessed body moved with the speed and lightness of a man half his weight. His meaty hand grasped Dean’s neck as he slid him off his feet and up against the wall of the vault. Dean’s feet strained for the solid floor, his toes dangling inches above the cement.</p><p>James looked at Dean with a discerning eye, as though he had just discovered a brand-new species of insect. He rolled Dean’s head from side to side as Dean gasped for breath.</p><p>“Listen buddy,” Dean managed to choke out. “I know you’re super glad to get into a new meatsuit—though frankly you could have picked someone in better shape. How ‘bout you leave the poor shmuck alone?”</p><p>James brought Dean’s face close to his own and sniffed him.</p><p>“Whoa, guy, I’m not into the kinky stuff,” Dean squawked, noticing the wild look in the man’s eyes. “This is a little too Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom for me. How about you let me go?”</p><p>With a swoop of his arm, James threw Dean clear out of the vault. He sailed over the ramshackle table outside and hit the concrete wall, head first. He slumped to the ground, consciousness fading quickly. The last thing Dean heard before blackness took him was a howling, ferocious bark.</p><p>When Dean woke up, the asshole desk clerk was looming above him. Dean turned his head with difficulty. He noticed the vault was closed and James McMannon was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Dean lifted his arm to the desk clerk. “Can I get a little help?”</p><p>“You’re fired. Return your uniform and get out.”</p><p>Dean managed to lift himself up on one elbow.</p><p>“You mean I don’t get to keep this cute little hat?”</p><p>The desk clerk sneered, turned, and walked away.</p><p>Dean felt the goose egg on the back of his skull. So much for working from the inside.</p><p>As he got to his feet, Dean had to brace himself against the wall. He stumbled a little—he hadn’t been unconscious quite long enough for all that vodka to metabolize.</p><p>After returning his bellhop monkey suit, Dean stumbled out onto the dark sidewalk. The sun had set, but when? How long had he been out? His watch had stopped when he came to in 1954, and he hadn’t managed to get it going again. He looked both ways, trying to figure out which direction the apartment was. Then he heard the quick clip of shoes on the sidewalk. Two NYPD officers were quickly approaching him, and that couldn’t be good news. Dean spun on his heels and tried to cross the street, but the officers quickly grasped both his arms.</p><p>“Had a little too much to drink did you, guy?”</p><p>Dean looked at them, a tad bleary-eyed.</p><p>“Not at all officers. I just woke up. Had the most wonderful night with Marilyn Monroe. She’s a hell cat.”</p><p>“We should let DiMaggio have a bat at your face for that one,” said one of the officers, as the other hailed a paddy wagon.</p><p>When it arrived, they shoved Dean roughly into the back of the vehicle and sped away.</p><p>By the time Sam got to the police station, Dean had been sitting in a cell for a couple of hours. The station chief led Sam down into the holding cells beneath the old building, where he discovered his brother sitting contently on a clean bunk drinking coffee and playing poker with his cell mate, a guy in a rumpled suit who looked like his three-martini lunch had got out of hand. Dean jumped up when he saw Sam.</p><p>“You have ten bucks on you?”</p><p>“Dean, I can’t use any of my money. It’s useless.”</p><p>“Exactly, so give me a ten,” Dean whispered, indicating the guy behind him.</p><p>Sam dug in his pockets and pulled out a bill. Dean took it and threw it down on the ground between the cots.</p><p>“I’ll see your five and I’ll raise you five,” Dean said. He then sat back against the wall.</p><p>“Too rich for my blood,” the guy said.</p><p>“Guess the pot is mine then.” Dean pulled a pile of change and bills toward him. “Thanks for a good game.”</p><p>The guard unlocked the door.</p><p>“Thanks Joe, keep up the good work.” Dean smiled at Sam as he held up his winnings in 1954 dollar bills.</p><p>The boys made their way out of the station.</p><p>“Nice going with staying under the radar, Dean.”</p><p>“I didn’t have a choice. I was this close to nabbing the scroll. And news flash! McTubby the guard wasn’t any regular guard. He was possessed by a demon, and now he’s on the loose. And it really doesn’t help that you lost Ruby’s knife.”</p><p>They stepped out onto the street.</p><p>“Wait, what do you mean he was possessed?”</p><p>“You know, black eyes, super-human strength, the whole shebang, right here in 1954.”</p><p>“What did he want?”</p><p>“To eat my liver? How should I know?”</p><p>“Well, did he say anything?”</p><p>Dean paused, trying to remember. “He didn’t so much talk, as... bark.”</p><p>“What, like a dog?” Sam asked, amused. When Dean’s facial expression remained stony, he realized it wasn’t a joke. “Wait, really? Like, a demon guard dog?”</p><p>“Half dog, half man? Sort of a man-dog. More dog than man. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. The most important thing right now is staying out of its way long enough to get the scroll. Getting back to 2010 alive would be a nice perk.”</p><p>By the time the Winchester brothers made it back to their small apartment, it was almost three in the morning. They spent half an hour comparing notes and going over the events of the last twenty-four hours. Sam told Dean everything he had learned at the library and from Walter, minus the information about Abaddon.</p><p>Given all they had discovered, the boys were now faced with a couple of problems. Though they knew when the transaction was going to take place, they didn’t know who the actual buyer of the scrolls would be. They knew that a banker had been involved in the sale, but it would take some legwork to find out who that was. Even if they did find him, it would be much easier to take the scrolls before the actual transaction, rather than trying to grab them at the Waldorf Astoria, especially now that Dean had lost his job. They also had no weapons, and no idea how to contact Don once they actually had the War Scroll.</p><p>The one mercy granted them that night came from an unexpected source. Their next-door neighbors had been going at it with some vigor the whole night, to the point that the wall was shaking. At the height of the banging, a Murphy wall bed sprang loose from the wall where it had been hidden from view.</p><p>“The good news,” Sam said, “is that the thief didn’t find it either.” He then claimed the bed and was asleep in minutes.</p><p>Dean lay on the worn couch. Feels like I haven’t slept in years. His thoughts drifted to the leggy brunette in the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria. In 2010, it wasn’t unusual to see a woman traveling by herself; in 1954 it was another story. He wondered who she was and where she had come from. There was something about how she carried herself. He was drawn to her confident walk and the way she had looked right at him—almost into him. Dean thought that after hunting down the demon-possessed guard, he might hang around and try to run into her again. He fell asleep trying to craft an opening line that would be suitable for the era.</p><p>In the morning, Sam and Dean sat on the steps of the New York Public Library sipping cups of coffee. Dean couldn’t believe coffee was just five cents, and a whole pizza was seventy-five cents. It was like living in food paradise.</p><p>They discussed what their next move was. They decided that Sam would send a telegram to the address on the Wall Street Journal classified ad, saying that he was interested in buying the scrolls.</p><p>Dean wanted to go back to the Waldorf and find James— it couldn’t be a coincidence that demon was hanging around the site of the upcoming auction. But before returning to the hotel, he headed to a secondhand store determined to buy a suit, after which he planned to get a close shave. If he was going back to the Waldorf as a civilian, he didn’t want to look out of place.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam found a Western Union and sent a telegram to the party selling the scrolls.</p><p>INTERESTED IN BIBLICAL SCROLLS SEEN IN CLSFD AD IN WSJ STOP HAVE FUNDS STOP SERIOUS BUYER STOP PLEASE RESPOND QUICKLY STOP SINGER</p><p>In fact, they didn’t have any funds, but Sam was going to cross that bridge when he came to it. He thought the little hat tip to Bobby was appropriate, and he wished more than ever that Bobby was there to help them.</p><p>Sam told the clerk where he could be reached, and said he would stop back in an hour to see if there was a response. He then made his way to Gimbels.</p><p>Browsing the men’s section, Sam found a wool suit for twenty-eight dollars. He had the money—Dean’s tips and his poker game in the holding cell had netted them about a hundred bucks—and Sam decided the suit was worth it. He wore it out of the store, his regular 2010 clothes stuffed into the Gimbels bag.</p><p>Sam noticed a barber shop right outside the department store. Only “a little off the top”, turned out to be about four inches. Sam stared at himself in the shop’s mirror. Now that is different, he thought. The barber smoothed his hair back with a little Murray’s Pomade and he was ready to go.</p><p>When he stopped back at the Western Union, a telegram was waiting for him.</p><p>SINGER STOP WILL CONSIDER GENEROUS OFFER STOP MEET AT 21 CLUB AT 11 AM STOP ASK FOR FELDMAN</p><p>Sam looked up and saw a clock on the outside wall of a nearby a bank; it was 10:30 a.m. He asked a passerby for directions, and then started north up Sixth Avenue; he would get there right on time.</p><p>At the 21 Club, Sam admired the lawn jockeys mounted on the porch roof of the street level restaurant below. He had never been here before. Whenever the brothers had been in New York, it had always been on a hunt. They had never really got to enjoy the culture of the city.</p><p>Sam entered the dark restaurant. Red leather booths ringed the room and every inch of it was strung, hung or hugged with a toy of some sort. A maître-d’ ushered Sam to a table where a young man in a dark-brown suit was already sitting, Sam was sure he couldn’t be a day over twenty-five. He wondered how this kid could possibly be in the business of selling ancient biblical texts.</p><p>“Mr. Feldman?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No, I’m his attaché, Mr. Benjamin Shochat.” The man stood up and shook Sam’s outstretched hand. “I speak on Mr. Feldman’s behalf. You’re Mr. Singer, I presume?” The man had a lilting accent that sounded Middle Eastern.</p><p>“Yes. Good to meet you,” Sam replied. He sat down and motioned for the waiter to bring him a glass of water. “I’m interested in the scrolls and I’d like to bid on them, but I want to see them first.” Sam had clocked that the man was empty handed when he walked up to the table. If he could convince Shochat to take him to the Waldorf and show him the scrolls, he was in business.</p><p>Mr. Shochat studied Sam’s face. “You are working for someone, yes?”</p><p>“I’m not at liberty to say just yet,” Sam improvised smoothly. “But if I was speaking on behalf of someone else, it would be a very serious buyer with a large amount of capital. This person would like me to examine the merchandise first, however.”</p><p>“Not possible,” the young man responded with a snort. “They are being kept in a vault, under heavy security.”</p><p>“At the Waldorf Astoria,” Sam said with a smile, metaphorically laying his cards on the table.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Shochat was clearly ruffled and trying not to show it.</p><p>“I know things. I’d like to see the scrolls.”</p><p>“How do I know you have sufficient funds?”</p><p>Sam stood up. “I think I’ve already proven how serious I am Mr. Shochat. Kindly have Mr. Feldman contact me if he wants to do business.”</p><p>Shochat was looking increasingly nervous. It was clear he was in over his head, and was afraid that if he didn’t act carefully, he was going to let a big fish go.</p><p>“Okay, wait,” he said hastily. “Please sit.” He drank a little from his water glass. “Mr. Feldman has another interested party, and they’ve made an initial offer of 100,000 US dollars. Are you willing to go higher?”</p><p>Sam realized that since he didn’t actually have any money at all, he could say anything he liked. He sat back down at the table.</p><p>“If the scrolls are genuine, twice that price would be a bargain,” he said blithely.</p><p>Shochat leaned back in his chair, clearly impressed. Then Sam remembered that in an era of twenty-eight-dollar suits and seventy-five-cent large pizzas, 200,000 dollars was an enormous amount of money. He waited while Shochat thought it over. I just need an invite to the auction, that’s all. He and Dean could do the rest themselves.</p><p>“I’ll get back to you,” Shochat said at last and stood up. “I’ll speak with Mr. Feldman. I can’t negotiate for him.”</p><p>“Fine,” Sam said standing up as well.</p><p>The young man set a derby on his head, tipped it in Sam’s direction, and left.</p><p>Dean stretched comfortably in the large leather barber’s chair. He was impressed by the incredibly close shave he’d been given. Why did men ever give these up? he wondered.</p><p>He had bought a secondhand dark-colored suit, a white shirt, and a black derby. Dean had never been a hat guy, per se, but he liked the feel of the derby. He wondered if he could conceal a weapon of some kind in it.</p><p>Out on the street, close shaven and besuited, he felt completely incognito. Now he could slip around the hotel unnoticed, giving him another chance at the scrolls.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dean stepped into the opulent lobby of the Waldorf Astoria. No alarms went off. Disguise is working, I guess, he mused. Using a key set he had neglected to return the day before, he accessed the back stairwell. Slipping quietly into the sub-basement, he immediately realized his plan wouldn’t work.</p><p>Apparently, someone had taken his intrusion yesterday very seriously—there were now three guards waiting outside the vault, and all of them were armed. Before they noticed him, Dean slipped through a half-open door to his left.</p><p>He found himself inside a dank supply closet, containing a single metal chair with a man slumped in it, his back to Dean. Cautiously, Dean moved toward him.</p><p>It’s James the security guard, he realized. Fast asleep—Wait, do demons sleep? Since he wasn’t carrying any weapons, he decided to let the sleeping dog lie. Then he caught sight of the burlap sack in the corner and remembered a handy factoid: During the nasty New York winters, janitors used salt to melt ice on the sidewalks in front of important buildings like the Waldorf Astoria. And it looked like the hotel’s salt supply was stored in this very cupboard.</p><p>Dean ripped open the corner of a bag and emptied half of it. He’d need to move fast if this was going to work. He hefted the sack in his arms.</p><p>“What the St. Mary are you doin’?” James asked, suddenly awake and wiping saliva from the side of his mouth.</p><p>Dean hesitated, the bag of salt raised above the guard’s head. Making a quick decision, he lowered the bag to his side.</p><p>Neither man spoke for several seconds, then Dean cleared his throat.</p><p>“Getting salt,” he said.</p><p>James rubbed his eyes, which were a normal greeny-blue color.</p><p>No sign of demonic possession. Nevertheless, Dean knew that the demon could still be inside James, biding its time.</p><p>“Do you remember me?” Dean asked.</p><p>James leaned forward in the chair, running his hands through his short hair.</p><p>“No, buddy. Why would I?”</p><p>Looks like he has the world’s worst hangover, Dean thought. Oddly, he felt some sympathy for the man.</p><p>“It’s nothing. Thought maybe you went to my church,” he said.</p><p>James looked up at Dean, his face blotched and red.</p><p>“Take your salt and leave me alone,” he said, without a hint of recognition on his face.</p><p>He really doesn’t recognize me, Dean thought. Maybe Cujo’s moved on? He did as he was told, hefting the bag of salt and starting toward the door. He considered ‘accidentally’ dropping the sack into James’s lap as he walked past, but he controlled the impulse. There were three guards outside the door, each one capable of putting a bullet in Dean if they realized he was back at the Waldorf.</p><p>Slipping back into the stairwell, Dean dumped the sack of salt and considered the situation. If James was still possessed, it was one of the strangest demons Dean had ever encountered. The hosts usually retained the memories of the demon, and vice-versa. Maybe it’s not a demon at all. Maybe it’s something else—that could explain the barking.</p><p>Back in the lobby, Dean crossed to one of the bars. He ordered a Seven and Seven and sank into a deep red-velvet club chair.</p><p>“May I join you?”</p><p>Dean looked up. The girl from the day before stood in front of him. She was dressed in a slim burgundy suit, with a skirt that stopped just below her knees. Not waiting for an answer, she sat down opposite him.</p><p>“So, one day you’re a bellhop, the next you’re at the bar as a guest. That’s peculiar,” she said, looking him over. Her eyes seemed to tick off each article of clothing Dean was wearing, as well as taking note of his features.</p><p>He leaned forward. “It’s also peculiar that you noticed,” he said.</p><p>The girl smiled, but didn’t blush.</p><p>“How could I forget? It’s not often a man offers to buy me a drink within thirty seconds of meeting me.”</p><p>“Give it a little time. When the sixties hit, girls like you will be—“ Dean stopped himself. Why ruin the swinging sixties for her? “Anyway, I apologize for being so forward. It’s not like me at all.”</p><p>“You’re already lying to me? That’s not a great sign.”</p><p>“Okay, it is exactly like me,” Dean said, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s refreshing. It means you’re not that complicated.”</p><p>“Is that supposed to be a compliment?”</p><p>The girl laughed. “Sort of.”</p><p>Dean lied again. “I didn’t catch your name yesterday.”</p><p>“Julia. Julia Wilder.”</p><p>She held out her petite gloved hand and Dean shook it politely, grinning at the strange formality of the gesture.</p><p>For half a second, he almost told her his real name. “I’m Malcolm. Malcolm Young,” he said instead. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“You didn’t answer my question, Malcolm. How are you a bellhop one day and a guest the next?”</p><p>“Big promotion,” Dean said carelessly.</p><p>She beckoned over the bartender.</p><p>“Scotch, please. One ice cube,” she instructed.</p><p>Dean raised a brow. That was a stiff drink for such a small woman. As though she could read his thoughts, Julia leaned forward.</p><p>“My father and I have lived all over the world. I’m very adept at drinking liquor. It’s unusual for a woman, I know.”</p><p>Dean smiled. “I was actually going to say impressive.”</p><p>“So Malcolm Young, tell me about yourself.”</p><p>“Not much to tell, really. I’m in New York on business with my brother.”</p><p>“What kind of business are you in? Besides carting bags, that is.”</p><p>Dean adjusted his secondhand suit jacket.</p><p>“Family business. Extermination. I was in the bellhop outfit so I could explore the hotel without alerting the guests.”</p><p>“Are you saying there are bugs in the Waldorf Astoria?”</p><p>“You didn’t hear it from me.” Dean raised his glass. “To being bug free.”</p><p>Julia Wilder clinked his glass, then, with a lady-like swig, emptied hers. She stood up and smoothed her skirt.</p><p>“Very nice meeting you, Mr. Young. Again.”</p><p>“You’re leaving?”</p><p>“I have an appointment. Are you going to be in the city much longer?”</p><p>“We’re waiting for a bid, then we go home,” Dean said. It wasn’t a total lie.</p><p>“Perhaps I’ll see you again.” She smiled and then walked across the lobby to the guest elevators.</p><p>Dean watched her and sighed. Why do all the cool girls live in the past?</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam stopped by the Western Union, and found another telegram from Mr. Feldman was waiting for him.</p><p>JULY 1^ST^ NOON PRESIDENTIAL SUITE WALDORF ASTORIA</p><p>Sam had done it, he had gotten them an invite to the auction. Now the challenge was getting hold of the scroll itself. Could get dangerous, especially if Dean is the one who comes up with the plan.</p><p>The obvious next step—they needed guns. Their usual contacts in New York were for the most part not even born yet, so Sam had to come up with an alternate solution. He decided to make his way to Little Italy. Thanks to his older brother, Sam had seen all the Godfather films dozens of times, and figured it couldn’t all be fictional. After all, Mario Puzo knows what he’s talking about.</p><p>Leaving Canal Street Station, Sam aimed for some of the smaller side streets of Little Italy. Ten minutes later, he stood in front of a restaurant with a CLOSED sign in the window. Inside, he could see several middle-aged men sat talking around a large table. A similarly weathered-looking man sat out front, picking grape seeds from between his teeth.</p><p>“Hi,” Sam began hesitantly. “I was hoping to speak to someone, about a... business arrangement.” Now that he was standing in front of what could be a real Mafioso, he had no idea what to say.</p><p>“Members only,” the man said looking up. Sam noticed that one of his eyes was swollen shut.</p><p>“That’s quite a shiner,” he commented.</p><p>“Look kid, move along if you know what’s good for ya.”</p><p>Normally, Sam wasn’t one to cause a scene. In this case, with the weight of the world resting on his shoulders, he was willing to break with tradition. He took a deep breath and plunged in.</p><p>“Listen, guy, I don’t have time for subtlety. I need guns. Lots of guns.” Sam pulled his remaining dollar bills from his pocket and waved the wad at the guy. “I’m willing to pay—“</p><p>“Whoa. Put that away.” The guy looked both ways along the street. He got up and pushed Sam roughly inside the foyer and against the wall and frisked him. Sam stood completely still. He knew better than to wiggle around when a Goodfella was getting handsy.</p><p>“Up there, second floor.”</p><p>Sam thanked him and headed for the stairs, passing the small cluster of guys who it turned out were playing a poker game in the main room—he made a mental note to tell Dean, in case they needed to replenish their cash reserves.</p><p>A small man, about forty years old and wearing a cable-knit sweater, sat at a desk on the second floor landing. Two bigger guys stood by the wall, their hands clasped in front of them. They were clearly packing some sort of weapon.</p><p>Sam cleared his throat and explained what he needed: two shotguns, two handguns, and no questions.</p><p>The transaction went very smoothly, all things considered. In the end Sam was only able to afford the two shotguns and ammunition, but within a few minutes he was holding a packed duffel and surrendering the last of his cash.</p><p>As he was preparing to leave, Sam hesitated.</p><p>“Um, actually,” he began. “I don’t know how I’m going to get these back uptown. See, I gave you all my money, and—“</p><p>“Bambi will drive you,” the cable-knit guy said. He motioned to the slightly bigger of the two men near the wall. Bambi nodded.</p><p>A black 1953 Cadillac idled in the back alley. Bambi held open the trunk while Sam dropped the duffel inside. Then Sam reached to open the back door of the car.</p><p>“Upfront,” Bambi ordered. “I ain’t a chauvinist.”</p><p>Sam was pretty sure he meant ‘chauffeur,’ but regardless, he did as he was told, and they were on their way. As they cruised up 5^th^ Avenue, Sam stole a couple of glances at his driver. His mouth looked like it had been cut with a meat cleaver, with pock-marked skin that hung in indefinite wrinkles down his face.</p><p>Sam attempted small talk. “So, why do they call you Bambi?”</p><p>“‘Cause of my doe eyes,” Bambi growled and looked at Sam with big droopy, brown eyes. They would have been adorable, if they weren’t filled with murder.</p><p>“Ahh.” Sam realized he was in a car with a complete sociopath. Give him a demon any day.</p><p>When they reached the apartment, Sam pulled the duffel bag from the trunk and said goodbye to Bambi. The car departed at speed.</p><p>Sam carefully stashed the shotguns in the small apartment, and smiled to himself, pleased with his hiding place. He then decided to see if Dean had made any progress at the Waldorf.</p><p>When he arrived at the hotel, he immediately spotted Dean. He was sat at the bar, chatting to the bartender, who clearly thought he was a lunatic.</p><p>“Aww, he’s great,” Dean slurred. “When they play ‘Stairway to Heaven’ he goes like, da dah daaaah.” Dean mimicked an air guitar. “You’re going to love them. Led Zeppelin—look out for them.”</p><p>Sam tapped his brother on the shoulder. Dean turned toward him, bleary-eyed. “Hey bro. How ya doing?”</p><p>“Dean, we’re in the middle of a job. What are you doing?”</p><p>“We’re in the middle of the century! Sit down, have a drink.”</p><p>“Not now Dean. Come on man, let’s go home.”</p><p>Dean scowled and slid off his seat. “Okay, fine.”</p><p>Dean stumbled away from the bar with Sam holding his arm. Then he looked at his brother, suddenly dead sober.</p><p>“What took you so long? I’ve been playing drunk for hours. That girl over there to the left—I had a drink with her. She said she had an appointment and she’s been lurking around the lobby ever since.”</p><p>Sam looked around, but he couldn’t see any girl. He wasn’t entirely sure that Dean was just playing drunk.</p><p>“Sam, I think she’s here for the auction. For the first hour, I just thought it was my animal magnetism, but I’m starting to think she’s onto us.”</p><p>“You don’t say,” Sam replied, pulling Dean along by the arm. “By the way,” he said, “I haven’t been sitting around wasting time at a bar. I scored us an invite to the scrolls auction, and the hardware we need to pull it off. Three days from now. Noon. Here.”</p><p>As the brothers walked out the door, the girl who called herself Julia Wilder followed close behind. She was now wearing a blonde wig and a light-green suit. It was the best disguise she could put together from her suitcase upstairs. Now that she had confirmed that the two young men were working together, she allowed them to escape from her sight and made her way to the lobby phones.</p><p>“Columbia 367,” she directed. After several seconds, a voice answered the phone. “Hi. It’s me. You were right, they’re together. Definitely casing the place.”</p><p>As the other party spoke into her ear, Julia’s face fell.</p><p>“No, I know. They won’t. I won’t let them,” she said.</p><p>With that, she hung up and went back to her room.</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In Dean’s pretty extensive life experience, there really wasn’t very much that could compare to a good bacon cheeseburger. Despite that, the hot dog—with everything—that he devoured as he and Sam marched back to their apartment came close.</p><p>Sam was decidedly less enthusiastic about their dinner.</p><p>“Nothing like mystery meat you bought from a guy wearing a skirt,” he said distastefully, swallowing the last of the bun and flicking ketchup off his fingers onto the sidewalk.</p><p>The sun had set behind the towering buildings, casting long inky shadows over the boys’ route. But as the city fell into darkness, it seemed to be coming alive.</p><p>“Can you imagine the kind of supernatural critters that must be running around these alleys?” Dean asked as they passed a particularly decrepit-looking apartment complex.</p><p>“Dad’s journal had a lot on New York,” Sam replied. “Wouldn’t be surprising if there were other hunters working the city—we know there are in the future,” he said thinking of General Cox. Sam gave his brother a cautious look, as if he was worried Dean wouldn’t like what he was going to say next. “It might be something to consider if we need backup.”</p><p>“Backup schmackup,” Dean responded. “What do we need other hunters for? We’ve got guns. Plus, you think we’d be able to convince anyone to help us once we start talking about the Apocalypse... and coming from the future?”</p><p>“Guess you’re right.”</p><p>“Damn straight. We tell anybody what we’re doing here, we risk them interfering,” Dean said definitively, knowing that interference may well be the least of their troubles. That certain people—and/or forces of Hell—would kill or worse in order to stop Sam and Dean was left unspoken. They both knew it, so it bore no repeating.</p><p>They walked up the cracked steps of Villard House. The sound of an ancient television set echoed out of the landlady’s open door as they passed by.</p><p>“Lady’s watching the DuMont Network in there,” Dean said with a grin.</p><p>“The what?” Sam asked, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Dean just stared at him, incredulous. He sometimes forgot how young Sam was. Not that Dean himself had been alive to watch the DuMont Network, which, in 1954, was due to be shut down in two years, but he watched enough TV to be familiar with its history.</p><p>“Cavalcade of Stars? The Honeymooners? Not ringing a bell? Seriously?”</p><p>“Do you watch those shows before or after Dr. Sexy, M.D.?” Sam asked, derisively.</p><p>“I’m off Dr. Sexy,” Dean said.</p><p>“Tell me again about the girl,” Sam said, his voice serious.</p><p>“Julia.”</p><p>“She was tailing you?”</p><p>Dean slipped the key into the door of their apartment.</p><p>“She was definitely interested,” he replied.</p><p>“Becky Rosen interested, or demon Meg interested?” Sam probed.</p><p>“Listen buddy, both of those chiquitas were after you,” Dean said, trying to keep the vision of Becky rubbing Sam’s chest out of his mind. “So, where are they?” Dean looked around the room. “You lose the guns just like you lost the knife?”</p><p>“Dean, it was stolen,” Sam retorted. Then, realization dawned on him. “... By a girl. Brunette, cute, about five-foot six?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Could be the same girl that brushed past me in the hall,” Sam continued. “Right before I realized the knife was gone.” He walked to the Murphy bed, pulled it down, and extracted the gun-filled duffel from the bed’s cavity. “As for these, they’re safe and sound.”</p><p>Dean watched Sam wistfully. The kid really has become a good hunter, despite everything, he thought. He grabbed the weapon-laden bag and opened it.</p><p>“Fifties women, dude,” he said as he appraised the contents. “It’s like a big riddle, and Betty Draper is the... thing you get for solving a riddle.”</p><p>“Wait, are you still into the girl who you know is on to you? We got robbed already, Dean. We don’t have time for you to get played.”</p><p>“Don’t start. I know. I’m not hitting on anything that was born before the microwave.” Dean hefted one of the shotguns, and expertly tilted the weight of it back and forth to feel its balance.</p><p>“I was thinking...” Sam began, then trailed off.</p><p>“Spit it out, big guy,” Dean said. “Thinking about taking a crap? Thinking of getting us some toothpaste? ‘Cause your breath is ripe.”</p><p>“If this wasn’t 1954, we’d be loading these with salt, right?” Sam asked, grabbing a few of the shotgun shells. “But here, we’re not. Because we’re not just fighting demons and ghosts and things that go bump; we’re robbing humans. Humans who didn’t do anything to us, or to anyone, didn’t do anything wrong, and we’re going to hold guns to their heads? Doesn’t it faze you even a little to be the bad guys?”</p><p>“We ice Lucifer, nobody’s crying over a little bit of armed larceny,” Dean retorted.</p><p>“So the end justifies the means?” Sam paused. “‘Cause it sure didn’t when it meant me juicing up on demon blood.”</p><p>Sam’s words drilled into Dean.</p><p>“That was different,” he growled.</p><p>Sam shook his head and started to pace the room, the creaky floorboards giving slightly under his weight.</p><p>Dean looked at his brother impatiently. Why does he always have to make things so complicated?</p><p>“It was different,” Dean persisted. “Look, I’m willing to go pretty damned far to get this stupid scroll. Whether that includes killing or maiming some poor bastard who gets in our way, I’m not sure yet. Won’t know that till my finger’s on the trigger. But Sammy, I sure as hell am not willing to lose my little brother.” Dean let out a sigh. “Saving you is the reason we’re here.”</p><p>But Sam’s face was resolved.</p><p>“Nobody else gets hurt,” he said. It wasn’t a statement, it was a command. “I have enough blood on me already.”</p><p>Dean reached into his pocket, felt the wad of bills, and started toward the door.</p><p>“Where are you going?” his brother demanded.</p><p>“To buy salt,” Dean responded, and the door shut on him.</p><p>James McMannon stood on the threshold of his sister’s brownstone house, bathed in the flashing red and blue of a police cruiser’s revolving lights. Peering through the open curtains, he saw his sister. Maria’s face was blotted with tears, her left cheek pressed into the thick of an older man’s shoulder. Maybe a neighbor, James thought, not recognizing the man. At least she has someone. If he went inside, they’d ask him to explain something that couldn’t be rationally explained, to tell a story that no sane person would believe.</p><p>Two uniformed officers were visible as well, both of them wearing the forlorn grimace of men sharing bad tidings. Your son is dead, they’re saying. We found his body. James didn’t need to read their lips, all he had to see was his sister’s anguished face.</p><p>The sight drove James off the stoop and back onto the narrow sidewalk. He began to shamble slowly northward.</p><p>Over the course of the evening, he had managed to piece together his shattered memories of what had happened to Barney—what he had done to Barney. He had never felt particularly in control of the direction his life was taking, but this was something different entirely. For a good chunk of the past few days, James hadn’t been in control of his hands, his feet, or anything in between. Now he felt like a stranger in his own body, just stopping by until the next occupant moved in. Every few hours, he would simply wake up in a new place, unsure of how he had got there. The memories might eventually return, or they might not. Only one had stuck—</p><p>I killed Barney. And people are going to be looking for me. New York was a city with a million small, dim corners to hide in, and his only option was to find one of them and disappear into it. My sister’s son, he thought, the words burning into his psyche. The only person she had left. Facing her was not an option. He had to vanish.</p><p>However, as the swirling light from the police cruiser faded into the distance, James found himself doing something peculiar. He was walking back toward Manhattan, toward the first place people would be looking for him—the Waldorf Astoria. A nagging voice in the back of his mind insisted that everything could be worked out, if only he was back at the hotel.</p><p>If only he was near the vault.</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam left the apartment before the sun had crept above the skyline, knowing it would be hours before Dean woke on his own. They weren’t accustomed to staying in one place for this long, and with the auction still two days away, there wasn’t a particular need to roll out of bed early. For Dean, that was an overdue invitation to get more than four hours sleep. For Sam, it was an excuse to get some time to himself.</p><p>Dean had indeed bought salt for the shotguns, but he had stayed out nearly the whole night finding it. Sam didn’t want to know how Dean had spent the rest of his time, considering Dean’s tendency to fraternize with less-than-virtuous characters. I suppose I’m one of them, Sam realized. Nothing less virtuous than jump-starting Armageddon.</p><p>After a twenty-minute walk, Sam arrived at the clerk’s office for the borough of Manhattan. It was just before eight in the morning, but there was already a line forming at the information desk. A young woman, probably twenty years old and wearing a slightly too-tight sweater, stood behind the desk.</p><p>By the time it was Sam’s turn, she was starting to sound frazzled.</p><p>“Can I help you, sir?” she asked, the tone of her voice indicating that she hoped she couldn’t.</p><p>“Long morning already?” Sam responded with a smile, thinking that charm would be the best way to pull this off.</p><p>“No, sir. Did you have a records request, or is this a social visit?” she said tersely.</p><p>Sam was momentarily thrown.</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Yeah I do,” he stammered, and pulled out his wallet. He flipped through the selection of counterfeit IDs and badges, none of which were appropriate to the era. Settling for the most promising one, Sam flashed it at her briefly, then folded it back into his wallet before she could get a good look.</p><p>“Secret Service,” he intoned, changing tack to sound more serious.</p><p>The girl glanced over her shoulder at a morose-looking man sitting behind a typewriter, toward the back of the cluttered office. Her boss, Sam decided. He didn’t look any happier to be there than she did.</p><p>“Just one moment,” she said, getting up to talk to her boss. After a brief back-and-forth, the man came to speak with Sam directly. His narrow tie was knotted too tightly around his neck, making his head look like a bright-red balloon about to pop. Must be part of the dress code, Sam thought.</p><p>“Can I help you?” the man asked gruffly.</p><p>“Hi...” Sam replied, looking down at the man’s nametag, “Mr. Walker. The Secret Service requires a selection of blueprints for the Waldorf Astoria hotel.” Sam pulled out the fake ID again, intending to flash it for only a moment, but Walker grabbed the wallet out of his hand.</p><p>“Counterfeiters,” he barked.</p><p>“Uh, excuse me?” Sam responded, his hand reaching protectively for his wallet.</p><p>“What does this have to do with counterfeiters?” Walker asked, handing the wallet back to Sam.</p><p>“Oh, right. I don’t deal with counterfeit money,” Sam said, then he lowered his voice. “I protect President...” His mind raced, Who was the President of the United States in 1954? After Truman, before Kennedy. “Eisenhower. Sorry, we usually refer to him by his code name.” He leaned in, whispering, “It’s ‘Papa Bear.’”</p><p>The girl, who was now standing next to her boss, gave Sam a curious look, but Walker didn’t seem to have noticed Sam’s lapse.</p><p>“That right?” he said.</p><p>“He’ll be staying at the Waldorf Astoria in a few days. In the Presidential Suite,” Sam said.</p><p>“I’ll be damned. Ike staying right down the street from us!” Walker said, excited.</p><p>“Yes,” Sam agreed. “It’s very exciting for the people of New York. We—my colleagues and I—need to review the plans to look for security weaknesses in the hotel.” It was half true. With the plans, Sam was hoping to find an alternative entrance into the suite that wouldn’t draw suspicion from the Waldorf’s security, who would recognise Dean.</p><p>“They ain’t got that at the hotel? Seems they probably got a better idea about their plans and such than we would.” Walker had a point, of course, but the Waldorf employees would also know that Eisenhower had no plans to visit in the near future. This was the only way.</p><p>“Just doing my due diligence,” Sam replied.</p><p>“Marcia, see if we ain’t got that in the records,” Walker commanded, sending the girl scurrying away into the back room. “Say, what’s old Ike like, anyhow?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s... great. Just a swell guy. Really... tall.”</p><p>“Yeah? Got any stories?”</p><p>“Of course, but, you know, they’re top secret,” Sam said, trying to hold his poker face.</p><p>“Ah. ‘Course.” Walker said, disappointed. He looked like he was going to persist when, to Sam’s relief, Marcia returned to the desk with the plans.</p><p>Finding a corner table in the Records Office reading room, Sam poured over the blueprints, searching for a back door, a nearby service elevator—anything that would make their trip in and out of the Presidential Suite easier. He couldn’t help but think about how much simpler this would be in 2010. Electronic records had saved them more times than Sam could count, and symbols that were taking him ages to decipher could have been explained with a ten-second Google search. He’d definitely appreciate that convenience more when—if—they ever got back to the present.</p><p>Just as Sam was about to give up, Walker barged into the reading room, another rolled-up set of blueprints under his arm.</p><p>“Can’t believe I forgot about these,” he said, plopping the prints onto the table in front of Sam.</p><p>Sam looked at the designs, but wasn’t able to make head or tail of it.</p><p>“Being as he’s the President, it seems appropriate that he use the Presidential Siding,” Walker explained.</p><p>“The what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Are you kiddin’ me?” Walker’s face creased. He pointed at a knot of intersecting white lines against the field of blue paper. “You don’t know what’s under the Waldorf?”</p><p>And with that, Sam’s plan began to come together.</p><p>Dean woke up with a start to the noise of a dump truck reversing down the street outside. The sun blazed in through the small, barred window, brightly illuminating the fact that Sam wasn’t in his bed.</p><p>“Sam?” Dean called out. “You up?”</p><p>When no one responded, he slid off the couch and headed for the shower. Eight hours of sleep plus time for a hot shower. Dean hadn’t had both in months, probably not since Lucifer had been popped from his cage.</p><p>After his shower, he went straight to work disassembling the shotgun shells Sam had bought and refilling them with rock salt. He was nearly finished when the sound of keys rattled in the door’s deadbolt.</p><p>“Sam, that you?”</p><p>“It’s me. Don’t shoot,” came the muffled reply. As the door swung open, Dean’s eyes caught on the brown paper bag in Sam’s outstretched hand. It bore the unmistakable grease stains that came along with a cheeseburger, and instantly dispelled any hard feelings Dean had left over from the previous night’s conversation.</p><p>“Fastest way to a man’s heart, right?” he said, grabbing the bag and opening it. The smell was amazing, just the thing to remind Dean why life was worth living. “Where you been, anyway?”</p><p>Sam sat down next to Dean on the couch and grabbed his own burger from the bag.</p><p>“Clerk’s office, looking for blueprints,” he said.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And the good news is I may have found us an exit. The bad news is there’s only one elevator that services the Presidential Suite, and a security desk is right outside it.” Sam set his burger down without even taking a bite.</p><p>“You not eating that?” Dean asked, mouth full, then registered Sam’s annoyance. “What?”</p><p>“This would be a lot easier if you hadn’t been banned from the hotel,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean nodded toward the stack of rock salt shells he’d been working on.</p><p>“Hey, I’ve been doin’ my part. ‘Sides, you’re the one that dumped us on the Magic School Bus for this field trip.”</p><p>Sam didn’t protest, but he also didn’t jump in to apologize. Dean shrugged. Sam’s stubbornness was genetic—their father had it as well, and it was the thing that had driven them apart. Ironically enough, Dean, the boy who worshipped the ground his father walked on, was less like John Winchester than the son who wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>“Look, you wanna do your part, find another way to get into that meeting,” Sam said.</p><p>“Maybe we need to consider you flying solo,” Dean suggested.</p><p>“Are you serious?” Sam asked. “A few weeks ago you weren’t sure I was even cut out for hunting anymore, now you want me to commit armed robbery by myself?”</p><p>“You don’t think you can do it?”</p><p>“Of course I can do it,” Sam answered, agitated. “But is that our best plan? I show up, claiming to have 200,000 dollars in a briefcase, grab the scroll and run?”</p><p>“Sounds like a Winchester plan to me,” Dean said, licking his fingers clean of burger grease.</p><p>“Sounds like a stupid plan.”</p><p>“Usually it’s both.”</p><p>“Then let’s come up with a better one,” Sam offered. “From what Walter Sawyer told me, there could be a dozen people and institutions interested in the scrolls, so security is going to be tight. Maybe we can use that to our advantage. Create a diversion.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like where this was headed.</p><p>“By diversion, you mean me doing something stupid so you can smash-and-grab the scroll.”</p><p>“They know you,” Sam replied. “The guards upstairs will recognize you, so it won’t be hard for you to get a little attention.”</p><p>“And then they shoot me, you take off with the War Scroll, they shoot you, and our angel buddy can zap our corpses back to 2010,” Dean scoffed.</p><p>“What if your distraction isn’t, you know, violent?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Like I ask politely?”</p><p>“Like you pretend to be a Fed,” Sam said. “Or somebody who doesn’t believe the documents are genuine, come to warn the buyers that the seller’s a fraud.”</p><p>“Alright,” Dean said, gears clicking into place in his head. “Say that works. I bust up the proceedings, your boy Feldman is distracted, you grab the scroll... What about the demon?”</p><p>Sam’s face fell. If the demon was acting as a protector of the scroll, there was no telling what it would do.</p><p>“Last I saw, that guard seemed back to normal,” Dean said. “So it could be in anyone. Assuming it is some kind of protector, he’ll be there at the sale.”</p><p>“And we don’t have the knife.”</p><p>“You mean you lost the knife,” Dean pointed out.</p><p>“If we could get up there early, we could set up a Devil’s Trap, lure him into it,” Sam said, blowing past Dean’s accusation.</p><p>“But we can’t, so plan B,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam nodded toward the stack of rock salt shells Dean had spent the morning preparing.</p><p>“Salt shells will keep a demon at bay, but how do we get a couple of shotguns upstairs?”</p><p>“Easy,” Dean said. “We find a case big enough to fit ‘em, and you waltz right in carrying it. 200,000 bucks must take up a lot of space.”</p><p>“Security, Dean. They’ll check the case.”</p><p>As it was still untouched, Dean took another large bite out of Sam’s burger, letting the taste linger in his mouth for a bit. He did his best thinking while eating.</p><p>“Luggage,” he said finally.</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“We wait around the loading dock till it’s unattended, which it will be, because those bellhops are frickin’ lazy, trust me,” Dean answered. “Then we throw the shotguns in a bag headed for the suite. They’ll be there waiting for us.”</p><p>“That’s never going to work.” Sam let out a sigh.</p><p>“Don’t see you coming up with a better plan,” Dean said angrily, though he knew Sam was right. Getting the guns upstairs was one thing, getting access to them and pulling off the heist was something else entirely.</p><p>“We’re a little outside our comfort zone, Dean, but we’ve got to figure this out.”</p><p>“I know. Stop the Apocalypse, kill the Devil, reunite the Spice Girls, there’s a lot on our plate,” Dean said, starting to pace the small room. “Maybe we’re looking at this wrong. Maybe we go after the scroll once the buyer leaves with it. Jump ‘em outside.”</p><p>“How are we supposed to know who the buyer is?” Sam asked. “We wait outside, they could walk right past us with the scrolls in a briefcase and we’d never know.”</p><p>Picking up one of the rock salt shells, Dean started to flip the cartridge between his fingers.</p><p>“Well, whoever has a frickin’ demon following him, screaming bloody murder, that’s probably him.”</p><p>The discussion went round and round, not leading any place productive for over an hour. Dean wanted nothing more than to get out of the cramped apartment, but this particular dilemma needed all brains on deck. Finally, Sam relented and stepped into the bathroom, giving Dean the perfect opportunity to escape outside for some air. No one wanted to be near the bathroom when Sam was in it.</p><p>Seated on the front stoop of the apartment building, Dean watched as a stream of New Yorkers marched past, hurrying away the afternoon. They don’t know what’s coming, he thought, feeling for a moment like Sarah Connor in T2, the harbinger of doom nestled amidst the blissfully unaware. Of course, these people have fifty-six good years left. Not like us.</p><p>Sam joined him after a few minutes, both of them listening intently to the sound of traffic, taking in all of the sights and sounds of the run-down neighborhood.</p><p>As if he could read Dean’s thoughts, Sam suddenly laughed.</p><p>“Admit it,” he said. “You miss Dr. Sexy.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Early the next morning, Sam and Dean headed uptown to the Waldorf. Sam had insisted on another walkthrough of the lobby, and if they could get up as far as the Presidential Suite without arousing suspicion, then all the better.</p><p>While Dean skulked around the loading dock, Sam headed to the stairwell. He wanted to make sure that the exit strategy he had formulated from the blueprints would hold up in real life.</p><p>Slogging his way up the many flights of stairs was the most exercise Sam had done in weeks. Around the twentieth story, ascending to the top began to feel like an impossible task. It’d be pretty sad to die of a heart attack now, Sam thought. Whether that would be a good or bad thing for the world was another matter.</p><p>In the middle of contemplating that idea, a thunderous bark echoed up the stairwell, jolting Sam to attention. A second later, another bark pounded his eardrums, and he gripped his hands against his head tightly. If that’s a dog, Sam thought, I don’t want to meet its owner.</p><p>With the third bout of vicious howling, Sam realized that the noise was getting closer. It was coming up the stairwell—and fast. Dean said the demon barked. I don’t really want to find out if he’s right. He took the steps two at a time, hoping to outrun whatever hellish beast was downstairs. Hellish beast, Sam thought. It sounds exactly how I always imagined a Hellhound to sound.</p><p>Satan’s guard dogs, Hellhounds were the invisible beasts responsible for keeping up the nasty end of Hell’s bargains. If the demon that Dean met was somehow a Hellhound, or something like it, they were in even more trouble than they had thought.</p><p>The sound of water dripping was driving Dean crazy. Somewhere, some jackass hadn’t tightened a valve, or a nut, or whatever it was that kept water from leaking, and now it was ruining both Dean’s day and his nice new suit jacket.</p><p>He had been forced to hide in a storage locker when a truckload of perishables was delivered to the loading dock, only to have the kitchen staff take their lunch break right outside. It wasn’t the most undignified place Dean had ever hidden, but it was up there.</p><p>“Have I told you what happened at the Yankees’ game?” a muffled voice said outside the locker. For a moment, Dean pictured himself holding a baseball bat and using it to punish the kitchen workers for the twenty minutes of dull-as-shit conversation he’d been forced to endure. I bet Sam’s having fun, he thought bitterly.</p><p>The metal edge of the stair rushed at Sam’s face, catching him between the ear and eyebrow and momentarily blurring his vision. He had tripped while running up the flight of stairs, and from the sound of it, the Hellhound—or whatever it was—was only seconds behind him. Pushing himself upright, Sam risked a glance down the cavernous opening in the middle of the stairwell. It led all the way to the ground floor, maybe even underground.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hellhounds are invisible, Sam reminded himself. Keep running.</p><p>Lactic acid burned in his calves as he sprinted upward. Ahead of him, the door to the fortieth floor was only meters away. A terrible growling reverberated through the stairwell. Any moment Sam expected to feel the dig of teeth clamping onto his leg, but the sensation never came.</p><p>He darted into the hallway of the fortieth floor, slamming the door shut behind him. He scanned the space around him, but didn’t see anything that could be used to barricade the door. He did, however, hear something. The familiar electric buzz of a vending machine was coming from a nearby room. Bolting inside, Sam quickly locked the door. He found himself in what looked like a staff break room.</p><p>The snack machine weighed far more than Sam expected it to, and as he attempted to slide it along the floor it tipped over on its side. The laminate flooring shook with the massive crash, and Sam flinched. Everyone on this floor must have heard that. On the plus side, the machine was much easier to move now it was on its side. Sam slid it toward the door, effectively blocking it.</p><p>Bags of pretzels hung haphazardly inside the vending machine, with big chunks of Kosher salt on them. Sam kicked through the glass and pulled out as many bags of pretzels as he could. He crushed them in his hands and poured the contents across the vending machine. Whether that was enough salt to keep a demon or Hellhound at bay, Sam wasn’t sure.</p><p>He took a few moments to catch his breath, his ragged gasps for oxygen overpowering any noise from beyond the door. Leaning against the downed vending machine, he held in his breath for five seconds, allowing him to hear a raspy intake of air from the other side of the door. Some of the pretzel crumbs retreated under the door with the beast’s inhale.</p><p>It’s sniffing me out, Sam realized. It knows I’m here. But the door never rattled and the beast never brayed. Instead, Sam heard the hollow clomping of feet on metal stairs. The creature was moving on.</p><p>Sam waited a couple more minutes, then pushed the vending machine away from the door. He stepped over his makeshift salt and pretzel line and sighed. That was close.</p><p>“You must of been hungry,” a voice said from down the hall. Sam looked up to see an elderly woman standing there, wearing a plaid bathrobe and holding an empty ice bucket with both hands. She nodded toward the pile of snacks that had spilled out of the machine, and the accompanying broken glass.</p><p>Sam shrugged. “It stole my quarter.”</p><p>For Dean, sweet relief came in the form of a hotel supervisor, who marched down to the loading dock and admonished the kitchen staff for letting the perishables sit for so long without refrigeration. Dean was spared. As they exited, a burly-sounding line cook with a Jersey accent said something about a package being moved through the kitchen, but Dean couldn’t hear the full exchange. The one phrase he definitely heard was “big-ass jars.” They must have been moving the scrolls upstairs, Dean thought. Hope Sammy hasn’t run into any trouble.</p><p>Wringing the moisture out of his jacket, Dean exited the loading dock and headed back toward the Park Avenue entrance where he was supposed to meet Sam.</p><p>Oddly, Sam wasn’t waiting. Being the more punctual of the two of them, it wasn’t like Sam to miss a rendez vous. Taking a chance on not being recognized again, Dean smiled at the hotel doorman and strode boldly into the lobby. The dick desk clerk was on duty, so Dean joined a large crowd that was milling near the lounge’s piano. Sam wasn’t in the lobby, but the stairwell he’d taken would spit him out right in front of the crowd. A red-haired man was playing the piano with some proficiency, although Dean didn’t recognize the song.</p><p>Trying to blend into the group, Dean watched as a woman approached the pianist. She patted him kindly on the shoulder, whispered in his ear... and with the practiced skill of a professional, lifted the wallet from his jacket pocket.</p><p>She moved off quickly, but Dean was only seconds behind her. As she made her way toward the elevators, Dean grabbed her by the arm and spun her to face him.</p><p>“Should have friggin’ guessed,” he said.</p><p>The woman was Julia.</p><p>“Ah, how nice to see you again, Mister... I’m sorry, I’ve forgotten your name,” she said formally.</p><p>“Don’t sweat it, it wasn’t my real name anyway,” Dean responded bitterly. “Let’s go have a chat with the nice piano man.” He tugged at her arm, pulling her back toward the lobby. But she resisted, digging her heels into the floor.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I really have to get back to my room,” she said.</p><p>“We’re not done talking yet,” Dean threatened.</p><p>“Let go of my arm.”</p><p>“Give the ginger back his wallet,” Dean hissed, nodding toward the guy at the piano. Julia began to visibly struggle against Dean’s grip, attracting the attention of several other guests.</p><p>“Is there a problem, here?” a man asked, looking concerned.</p><p>With forced theatricality, Julia squeezed out a tear.</p><p>“This man has me confused with someone else,” she said with a sob.</p><p>Dean realized he had no choice but to let her go, and released his grip on her arm. She immediately hurried toward the elevator. Dean made to follow her, but was blocked by the hairy forearm of the dick desk clerk.</p><p>“You’ve been banned from the building,” he said. Then yelled, “Security!”</p><p>Julia stepped into the elevator and spoke quietly to the operator. Dean grabbed his opportunity, jamming his hand against the closing doors, halting them before she could disappear.</p><p>“What do you want with us?” he demanded. But before he could continue, he was pulled away by a trio of burly hotel employees and dragged roughly outside. He’d never been so quickly and efficiently bounced from an establishment before, and it seemed strange that it wasn’t for drunkenness.</p><p>Sam was waiting outside, eyes wide and with a fire in them that Dean hadn’t seen in weeks.</p><p>“What’s the haps? Where you been?” Dean asked, but Sam ignored his question.</p><p>“We need to leave. Now,” he said.</p><p>“So, is it a Hellhound, or a dude?” Dean asked, nursing a beer. “I’m lost.”</p><p>“I don’t know. It sure as hell sounded hellish, but I didn’t actually see anything.”</p><p>“Yeah, ‘cause you were hiding in the snack room.”</p><p>They had spent the rest of the day and into the evening trying to figure out exactly what the new developments meant for their plan. Dean had insisted that they hole up in a nearby dive bar, despite Sam’s protests. With the deal taking place the next day, they hardly had time to drink, but that had never stopped Dean before.</p><p>“You couldn’t have peeked out for a second?” Dean persisted.</p><p>His brother rolled his eyes, fed up with the circular conversation.</p><p>“I never saw the one that gutted you, either.”</p><p>“‘Cause that’s fair,” Dean muttered. “But you didn’t see its, like, hoof-marks—“</p><p>“It’s a dog, not a horse.”</p><p>“Whatever, but you didn’t see —“</p><p>“I didn’t see anything,” Sam shot back impatiently.</p><p>Their waitress came by with another pitcher of beer, but Sam shook his head at her. He then waited until she was out of earshot before continuing.</p><p>“So we have a demon, possibly a Hellhound, a scroll that could kill the Devil, no workable plan for how to get it, and apparently a pickpocket who has her eye on you.”</p><p>“Yeah, we’re doing pretty well, all told,” Dean said with a smirk. He pushed back his chair. “Time for bed.”</p><p>Sam followed his brother out of the bar and into the cool night, torn between needing his bed and wanting to better figure out their strategy for the next day. They had walked several blocks toward their apartment before he spoke up again.</p><p>“It’s my life on the line. I’m not sure we should be winging this.”</p><p>“We’ll do our best, Sammy. That’s all we can do.”</p><p>Just before midnight, James McMannon found himself standing in the hallway outside the Presidential Suite, walking the distance between the elevator, the stairwell and the suite’s door with an even cadence. He couldn’t particularly remember why he had chosen this hallway to walk in, or what he had been doing before he got here, but he knew that what he was doing was important. Someone has to be here, he thought.</p><p>Inside the Presidential Suite, something was giving off an incredible aroma. Like nothing James had ever smelled before. It made him feel very protective, as if it was his own child beyond that door.</p><p>Child. Nephew. Barney. Dead.</p><p>The words made James furious, but he couldn’t remember why. Did something happen to Barney?</p><p>No matter. James had to concentrate on whatever was inside the suite. The smell.</p><p>If anyone tries to take it away, I’ll kill them.</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam looks goofy in his suit, Dean thought with a chuckle. It was the morning of their big day, and Sam was doing his best to look respectable, but as usual the formal clothing just didn’t look right on his tall frame. They’d been over their plan several times already, but Sam demanded they run through it again. It still wasn’t much, but Dean had come up with a new idea overnight that might get them out alive. Whether or not they got the scroll was another matter.</p><p>Once Dean had suited up, the two of them made their way uptown to the Waldorf. They were about an hour early, which gave them time to move cautiously. Getting caught with a duffel bag full of shotguns and shells probably wouldn’t go over too well with the NYPD, even in the fifties. They’d bought a briefcase at a pawnshop for Sam to carry into the meeting, but with no way to procure the necessary funds, it was packed with old newspapers to give it some weight, and secured with an impressive-looking lock. Their entire plan hinged on Security not kicking Sam out for being broke before the auction had even begun.</p><p>Setting down the duffel on the street outside the Waldorf, Dean looked up at the building’s façade and smiled. What he saw there put his part of the plan in motion. Jesus, he mused, this could actually work.</p><p>The elevator rattled disconcertingly as it made its way up to the Presidential Suite. Sam tried to ignore it. He already felt like his stomach was in his throat, what was a little bit of motion sickness compared to the prospect of armed robbery?</p><p>Standing outside the elevator were two Waldorf security guards and a uniformed police officer. The cop looked annoyed to be there, probably thinking that no one would care enough about some old pieces of parchment to cause any trouble. Boy was he wrong.</p><p>“I’m here for the auction,” Sam said, aware that he was stating the obvious. The entire floor looked to be shut down for the event. A desk had been set up perpendicular to the elevators, effectively barricading one entire side of the corridor. The uniformed officer sat behind the desk.</p><p>“Your name?” he asked dully.</p><p>“Bob Singer,” Sam replied. “Maybe under Robert.” The policeman looked up at him with exasperation. “But you probably could have guessed that.”</p><p>“Yeah,” the cop said. “Thanks.”</p><p>Sam took a step toward the suite and felt a hand on his shoulder. It was one of the two Waldorf employees—the grungier of the two; the guy looked like he hadn’t slept in a week. Before Sam could say anything, the man narrowed his eyes and sniffed the air. Like a dog, Sam thought. That’s creepy.</p><p>“James, what the hell?” the other employee said, breaking the tension.</p><p>“He smells like death,” James said, his nose furrowing. As Sam girded himself for what seemed like an inevitable brawl, James cracked a smile, then started patting Sam down, looking for a concealed weapon. Yeah, still creepy, Sam thought.</p><p>Without meeting James’s gaze, he turned and grabbed the door handle to the Presidential Suite. Guess Dean’s man-dog theory was right. Not that it made any sense.</p><p>“Your briefcase, sir?” the other guy said.</p><p>“What about it?” Sam responded.</p><p>“We do not require the combination, sir, but we do require that you leave it outside of the suite. The Waldorf Astoria will take full responsibility for its contents during the auction.</p><p>Perfect, Sam thought. As long as they don’t get curious, I’m home free. He handed the briefcase off to the policeman at the desk and entered the suite. Paintings cluttered the walls of the entranceway, which was by itself fancier than any place Sam had ever stayed. It was a good thing he’d studied the blueprints of the place, or he’d have been too much in awe to keep his focus. To the right, a hallway led to the master bedroom—The bedroom where Kennedy will someday sleep, and Obama, Sam thought. To the left, an archway led into a small dining area, the table set with silver utensils and fine crystal. The suite had its own kitchen, and Sam spent a moment picturing Bill Clinton raiding the fridge in the middle of the night looking for spare ribs.</p><p>Across from Sam, past a small couch and chaise longue, was the main room of the suite. A cluster of people stood inside, chatting softly under the light of a chandelier. Nicer surroundings than our usual jobs, Sam thought. The only person in the group he recognized was Benjamin Shochat, Mr. Feldman’s aide. As he entered the main room, Sam noticed the collection of ornate clay jars on the center table.</p><p>“Welcome, Mr. Singer,” Shochat said with a wry grin. “So glad you could attend. Let me introduce you to my employer.” He waved his hand toward an elderly gentleman who was hunched protectively over the jars. The man looked at least eighty years old, but as he looked up at Sam, his eyes betrayed his still-sharp wit. His olive brow was deeply creased, a telltale sign of a stressful life. The complete absence of laugh lines further proved Sam’s assumption— this guy meant business.</p><p>“Mr. Singer, this is Mr. Feldman. The owner of the scrolls,” Shochat introduced him.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Singer,” Feldman said, his voice like gravel. “You have me very curious. Benjamin told me you were a young man, but I hadn’t fathomed the, well... extent of your youth.” He gestured toward the other potential buyers, all of them middle-aged. “I thought this to be an old man’s game.”</p><p>“I’m, uh, flattered, Mr. Feldman. But I’m merely a representative,” Sam responded.</p><p>The old man pursed his lips, considering that.</p><p>“As long as they have the money, anyone is welcome here,” he stated.</p><p>Sam took that as his cue to mingle. He approached a nervous-looking man, whose red hair seemed to glow in the chandelier-light.</p><p>“Mr. Singer—“ Sam began, but he was cut off abruptly.</p><p>“I know your name,” the man blurted excitedly. “You just said it. Why wouldn’t I have heard it?”</p><p>“Uh, sorry, just being polite.” Sam wasn’t going to make any new friends in this room, that much was clear.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to ask my name?” the red-haired man demanded.</p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it,” Sam replied, his attention now fixed on a table of hors d’oeuvres. He clocked a plate of deviled eggs, but was blocked by the red-haired man’s hand.</p><p>“Eli Thurman,” he said, and Sam found himself forced into a long and awkward conversation about what he felt the Dead Sea Scrolls meant for modern theologians. As the discussion twisted around topics Sam barely understood and certainly didn’t care about, he had to bite his tongue to stop himself from bringing up the Apocalypse. “Hey Eli, did you know I unleashed Satan?” he wanted to say. The socially-awkward yet talkative man would probably drop dead on the spot.</p><p>Twenty minutes of boredom later, Shochat brought the room to attention with a clink of his wine glass.</p><p>“Our last guest is arriving now, so we’ll be starting the sale.”</p><p>After all of the surprises the last week had brought, Sam was too worn out to act shocked. Instead, he just looked the newest arrival in the eye and extended a hand. “</p><p>Hi, Walter. Wasn’t expecting to see you here.”</p><p>Dean appreciated irony the most when it involved smashing public property. Yesterday, dripping water had nearly ruined his jacket, and now, the water that sprayed out of the broken Park Avenue fire hydrant would save his ass. The first phase of Dean’s plan was complete, and all it took was a wrench and the chutzpah to cause a ruckus in front of all of New York.</p><p>Scores of people assembled to watch the plume of water soak the sidewalk, Park Avenue, and a good portion of the Waldorf façade. One of those people, exactly according to plan, was the dick receptionist. A pleasant side effect of Dean’s mischief was the squeals of hoity-toity women trying to exit the Waldorf without getting wet. Ain’t happening, ladies.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Dean was able to slip into the loading dock and enter the service elevator, the duffel bag of shotguns slung over his shoulder. The next portion of his plan could very well be the stupidest thing Dean had ever tried, but there was no knowing for sure unless he did it.</p><p>The elevator’s dial pushed up to the forty-seventh floor. He’d have to hoof it from there. Exiting the elevator, Dean quickly found the roof-access stairwell and made his way back out into sunlight.</p><p>“That you, Johnny?” a voice demanded from across the roof. Most likely the person Dean was looking for.</p><p>“It’s, uh, Tony. Johnny’s... sick,” Dean said, hoping thatwould at least prevent the man from calling Security. There was a long pause and Dean took the opportunity to unzip the duffel, readying himself for a fight.</p><p>“Well, you here to help or what?” the man called.</p><p>Dean took the unexpected charity fate had given him. He zipped the bag back up and hoisted it onto his shoulder. Quickly bypassing a large power converter box, he got a glimpse of his target—a mustached man of Italian heritage who could have easily been cast as the third Mario brother. He was seated precariously on the building’s ledge, nonchalantly eating a Reuben sandwich.</p><p>“You the window washer?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No, I just come up here for the fresh mountain air,” the guy said dryly, kicking at the large squeegee lying on the roof next to him. “Now get strapped in, I’ll lower you down with the rest of the guys.”</p><p>As Dean stepped closer, he got a look over the edge and into the deep canyon that was 50^th^ Street.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll just str...” he trailed off, looking at the mechanism in question. “Son of a bitch,” he said, eyeing a mangled knot in the system of ropes, levers and pulleys anchored to the hotel’s roof. I’m supposed to go over the edge of the building strapped to that?</p><p>“What’s the problem,” the man said. It wasn’t really a question. The prevailing implication was that Dean was a sissy, and that a real man wouldn’t doubt the efficacy of the system. A slice of corned beef worked its way out of the window washer’s sandwich, falling over the ledge and down into the abyss of New York City. The man leant further overthe edge and called out, “Sorry ‘bout that, Lenny.”</p><p>Several waves of vertigo washed over Dean, one after another, stopping him from moving any closer to the ledge. Dean hated flying, and standing at the edge of a 500-foot chasm was twice as bad.</p><p>Okay, maybe this isn’t gonna work.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Guess I’ll have to find another translator, Sam thought. Something tells me that Walter won’t appreciate having a shotgun stuck in his face. Five minutes into the sale, Walter had only made a single low-ball bid—whether that was due to strategy or limited funds, Sam couldn’t be sure. Of course, Sam didn’t have any money, either.</p><p>Of the half-dozen interested parties, only three of them were truly serious about buying the scrolls. Eli Thurman, Sam’s alter ego, Robert Singer, and a Midwestern man who had introduced himself simply as “Gerald.”</p><p>Eli had initially offered 100,000 dollars, which everyone knew was too low a price. Gerald quickly countered with 115,000 dollars, which Sam raised by another 10,000 dollars. In the early phase of the sale, Sam concentrated on Shochat, who was moving deliberately around the room, looking out the windows, checking the side rooms, and not-too-subtly fingering the safety on the gun in his pants pocket.</p><p>As the bids grew higher, the three less-serious buyers dropped out entirely. Gerald and Eli were the most active in the auction, with Sam chiming in every now and then to keep things interesting. It began to feel like the sale might finish without incident when the sound of a commotion interrupted the proceedings. A large mass thumped against the door, then slid slowly down it.</p><p>Sam was the first on his feet, but Shochat pushed him back down to the couch.</p><p>“Go, Benjamin,” Mr. Feldman said calmly. Shochat followed the order, heading slowly toward the suite’s entrance, his pistol raised.</p><p>Sam quickly realized that his brother could be the cause of the noise. It wasn’t what they had planned, but it might be Dean’s plan B. Sam leaned his weight onto the balls of his feet, ready to spring for the clay jars.</p><p>“Who’s there?” Shochat’s voice demanded. He was now out of Sam’s line of sight.</p><p>The room was silent as everyone waited for a response, but there was no answer.</p><p>Come on, Dean, don’t get yourself shot.</p><p>On cue, Sam heard the door swing open. Two heartbeats later, a gunshot rang out, sending Sam leaping to his feet.</p><p>“Stop!” Mr. Feldman cried, putting himself between Sam and the jars.</p><p>Sam had enough inertia to plow the older man through the window, but he wasn’t going for the jars. He was going for the entrance lounge, where hopefully Dean wasn’t lying dead on the floor. His haste caused him to crash directly into Shochat, as he stumbled back into the room, clutching his bloody hand.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam called out, pushing Shochat aside.</p><p>“‘Fraid not, sweetie,” a melodious voice replied. A young woman charged into the room, a black pistol in her hand. She was beautiful, and vaguely familiar. That must be the girl, Sam realized, Julia.</p><p>Across the room, Walter swallowed hard. “Dear, what did I tell you about collateral damage?” he said.</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Keep it to a minimum. I know, Dad.”</p><p>Up on the roof, Dean was experiencing full-blown panic. There was no way he’d be able to go through with the plan. Rappelling down the side of a skyscraper strapped to a leather harness is not a friggin’ option. Sam is just going to have to say “yes” to Satan and fight the good fight.</p><p>“You’ve gotta calm yourself down, buddy,” the window washer said encouragingly. “You get nerves on this job, you’re gonna end up schmeared on a taxi like cream cheese.”</p><p>“What’s your name again?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Marco,” the man replied.</p><p>“Listen Marco, I need you to shut the hell up for a second.”</p><p>In all of their years hunting, Dean had never been this crippled by fear. Well, except for the ghost sickness, he remembered, but that wasn’t my fault.</p><p>Sam is down there, counting on you. Man the hell up.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, mustering all of his courage. “This is gonna come as a shock, but I’m new at this.”</p><p>“You don’t say,” Marco replied, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“So if you could lose the d-bag attitude for a second and help me get this harness on—“</p><p>“D-bag? Like a duffel?”</p><p>“It’s something your kids are gonna call you behind your back,” Dean said under his breath, picking up the extra leather harness.</p><p>“What’s in your d-bag, by the way?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Marco pointed at Dean’s weapon-filled duffel bag, which was still slung over his shoulder.</p><p>“Lunch.”</p><p>“Better eat it now. Leave it up here and it’ll be gone as soon as one of these guys comes up to piss.”</p><p>“Guess I’ll have to take it with me then,” Dean said.</p><p>With Marco’s help, he was soon strapped in and standing at the building’s precipice. Five other window washers were already suspended from the roof, working twenty flights above the roar of traffic below. The flood of taxis on 50^th^ Street looked the size of Hot Wheels, which didn’t help Dean’s vertigo in the slightest.</p><p>Dangling one foot over the ledge, he tried to count the floors down to the Presidential Suite. Thirty-fifth floor, he told himself. Twelve floors straight down. I can do this. Sam wouldn’t even think twice, and he’s a salad-eating nancy. With one last tug on the strap, he began to lower himself down the building’s façade.</p><p>“Hey, you forgetting something?” Marco called. In his outstretched hand he held a leather belt fitted with spray bottles and a squeegee. “Gotta say, Tony, even for a beginner, you suck at this.”</p><p>Taking the tool belt, Dean began his descent.</p><p>Walter and Julia weren’t wasting any time. They’d corralled Mr. Feldman, Shochat and the prospective buyers in a corner of the Presidential Suite, all of their faces wet with tears from the pepper spray Julia had used on the guards outside. No one had been killed, which was a relief, but Sam knew that could change in an instant if someone didn’t cooperate.</p><p>Blood from Shochat’s gunshot wound dripped onto Sam’s shoes. With Julia and Walter distracted by their examination of the clay jars, Sam pulled down one of the ornate curtains and ripped it into long strips, giving them to Benjamin to wrap around his hand.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?” Julia yelled.</p><p>“Keeping him from bleeding to death,” Sam replied angrily.</p><p>Before Julia could react, Walter interceded.</p><p>“It’s okay, Jules. We don’t want anybody to get hurt.”</p><p>Julia scoffed. She was clearly bad cop to Walter’s good cop.</p><p>“It’s too late for that,” Mr. Feldman said mournfully. His eyes weren’t on his assistant, but rather on the tallest jar, which Walter was carefully wrenching open. Sam noticed that he had dispensed with his sling.</p><p>“You think we want to do this?” Julia spat at Feldman. “This is for your own damn good.”</p><p>Sam caught a glimpse of the Devil’s Trap inscribed on the top of the lid as Walter set it back on the table.</p><p>“You don’t want to be opening that here, Walter,” he said.</p><p>“I know what I’m doing, Sam.”</p><p>“Sam?” Shochat questioned, looking puzzled. “I thought your name was Robert?”</p><p>“It’s Sam to my friends,” he said, with a hard look at Walter. “And people I thought were my friends.”</p><p>Walter looked away. Reaching into the open jar, he grasped at the contents. Sam flinched, the millennia-old scrolls would be impossibly delicate.</p><p>“Walter...” Sam said, again trying to warn him. But before he could continue Julia thrust her gun into his face.</p><p>“You want to let him concentrate,” she said through gritted teeth. “If this goes wrong, people are going to get thrown out the window.”</p><p>You have no idea, Sam thought.</p><p>Walter pulled a petrified-looking black object out of the jar with some difficulty. It clearly wasn’t a scroll, but rather some sort of stopper—an additional moisture barrier put in place to protect the fragile parchment, Sam guessed. Walter studied it closely, then set it aside, once more reaching into the jar. This time, his eyes lit up like a kid at Christmas. He must have struck parchment, Sam figured.</p><p>Outside the suite, something scraped heavily against the door.</p><p>“What was that?” Julia demanded.</p><p>“You tell me,” her father replied without looking up from his work. “You were supposed to handle them.” As he lifted the first scroll out of the jar, his joyous look faded. “Not the right one,” he muttered.</p><p>“Keep looking. I’ve got this,” Julia said, moving toward the door.</p><p>Sam took the opportunity to step out of the corner and over to Walter.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this,” he said softly. “You want to read the scrolls, wait for them to show up in a museum.”</p><p>“That’s not how it works, Sam,” the man replied. “The document I’m looking for is never going to be in a museum. If the wrong people get their hands on it...” He looked pointedly at red-headed Eli. “Well, that would be bad.”</p><p>Sam began to wonder exactly what Walter’s endgame was. Would he disappear with the scroll, abandoning his life in New York?</p><p>Julia returned from the door, pistol again trained on Sam and the others.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she said. “One of the guards twitching in his sleep. Now let’s get out of here.”</p><p>“This is it,” Walter said, hefting a second piece of parchment.</p><p>The War Scroll.</p><p>That’s not good, Sam thought. They’re after the same page that we are. Chances are, they’re not going to just hand it over once they hear our story.</p><p>James McMannon woke with a start. His head was ringing, his body was slumped against an overturned desk and his eyes were seared by pepper spray. Where am I? he wondered, before recognizing the slightly blurred but distinct carpeting of the Waldorf Astoria underneath him.</p><p>Memories flooded back all at once; the girl pistol-whipping him, his nephew, the strange fixation he’d had with that smell... That smell... It suddenly filled his nostrils, and everything else faded away. He had to get to that smell. Someone was trying to take it away from him, and that must not be allowed.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Sam yelled, getting dangerously close to the barrel of Julia’s handgun.</p><p>“Back up, or I swear to God I’ll put a hole in your face,” she shouted back.</p><p>Walter took the scroll and put it into his metal briefcase. In his haste to get it squared away, he fumbled the large clay jar, sending it crashing to the floor. As it shattered, everyone instinctively took a step back. Priceless history was buried in the mess of clay fragments, and no one wanted to be the one to step on it.</p><p>A look of immense regret washed over Walter’s face, then was replaced by abject horror. For an instant, an impossibly bright light spilled out of the jar’s broken remains.</p><p>That can’t be good, Sam thought.</p><p>As the sound of the crash subsided, it was replaced by a furious scraping from the entrance lounge. As before, it set the whole room on edge. This time, however, the tumult didn’t subside after a few seconds. Instead, it got louder and louder and was punctuated by the sound of something heavy hitting wood, as if an increasingly agitated animal was outside and wanted in. Like a dog, Sam thought. Perfect.</p><p>“Jules?” Walter said.</p><p>She raised her pistol to cover the entrance.</p><p>“Nothing out there we can’t handle,” she said confidently.</p><p>This would be a good time to interrupt, Dean.</p><p>With Julia’s attention on the entrance lounge, Sam crouched and began to pick through the clay shards. As he flipped one over in his hands, he found a rough pattern engraved on what must have been the jar’s interior surface. A sigil, he realized. Angelic magic. And now it’s broken. Whatever had been contained by it was now free.</p><p>The scraping stopped, the sudden and profound silence perhaps even more disturbing than the grating noise of claws on wood. Sam’s foot brushed away clay fragments, freeing a path between him and the entrance. Before he could move, Eli’s hand gripped his shoulder. The man’s eyes were as wide as saucers, betraying his desperation. He didn’t want Sam to leave them.</p><p>Then the world seemed to fracture. Wind exploded into the room, swirling the curtains and kicking up dust from the splintered jar. A cluster of glass slivers blew past Sam’s head, others lodged painfully in his back and neck. Knocked forward by the blast, it was impossible to keep his balance. Sam landed with a thud in the pile of parchment and clay, immediately rolling off to protect what was left of the scrolls.</p><p>As he sat up, he saw the oddest sight—Dean, hanging by a thread outside the suite’s now-empty window frame, a rock salt shotgun hefted offensively through the opening. He had come through on his part of the plan, although he was a little behind schedule.</p><p>“Sorry ‘bout that. Windows are mirrored.” Despite the needling pain from the glass and rock salt, Sam was incredibly grateful his brother had shown up when he had. But the sense of relief was short-lived.</p><p>In the entrance lounge, the door pounded off its hinges, catching Julia off-guard and smashing her against the wall. Walter, briefcase in hand, spun and ran back into the main room, but he couldn’t outrun the beast outside, which quickly overtook him. Claws dug into his leg, pulling him backwards.</p><p>From the main room, all Sam could see was Walter’s face as he disappeared out the door.</p><p>“Little help here?” Dean called out, still hanging outside the window. Sam moved to the hole, but instead of dragging Dean in, he pulled the shotgun out of his brother’s hand and rushed after Walter.</p><p>When he reached the entrance lounge, Sam stopped in his tracks. Walter was pinned to the ground not by a Hellhound, but by the ill-kempt security guard, James. His unnaturally long nails were digging like claws into the biblical scholar’s leg, leaving jagged gashes behind.</p><p>Sam leveled the shotgun and let loose a rock salt shell. The spread hit James square in the chest, hammering him into the far wall. But before Walter could move, the security guard was back on him, his eyes pitch black. Sam’s finger pulled back on the trigger once more, but nothing happened.</p><p>Damn it. Out of shells.</p><p>“Help me!” Walter cried as James took another swipe at him, gouging at his face. The demon then used his grip to lift Walter and slam him into the nearby sofa. Blood splattered across the cream wallpaper and a portrait of Harry Truman that hung nearby.</p><p>James then dived at the metal briefcase that had been hidden under Walter’s body. As he scratched at the lock, Julia scrambled up behind him, her pistol raised.</p><p>The shot nearly deafened Sam, who was mere feet from the business end of the handgun as it fired. The bullet tore into James’s back, exiting through his right shoulder and leaving a trail of gore across the couch. His limp body slumped over the briefcase, but Sam knew it wouldn’t stay down for long.</p><p>It took a lot more than that to kill a demon.</p><p>“Hey. Ass-hat.”</p><p>Sam turned to see his brother clambering over the jagged glass left in the window frame. Dean lobbed a set of shells toward Sam, who caught them deftly and began loading.</p><p>“Drop your weapons!” a voice shouted forcefully from the hallway. Sam looked up to see a brace of rifles pointed at him, a pair of burly police officers holding them. They were addressing both Sam and Julia, who was still holding her pistol as she tended to her father.</p><p>Sam was faced with about a dozen choices. Surrender, run, fight, try to talk... but he chose none of them. Instead he froze in place, fearfully eyeing James’s now-stirring body. Julia, on the other hand, spun around immediately and put the policemen in her sights. Like it or not, they were going to assume that Sam was working with her. That left him no option—he had to run.</p><p>As the officers opened fire, he dived for cover. Thankfully, their aim was wide, shattering the wood frame of the archway between the lounge and the main room instead of Sam’s head.</p><p>“Sam!” Dean yelled, his voice worried. He was struggling to unhook himself from his harness. He had his switchblade out and was sawing roughly at the fraying straps.</p><p>The sound of gunfire had pushed the rest of the room’s occupants further into the corner—except one. Shochat cinched the wrappings on his hand tight and moved toward the broken jar at the chamber’s center. Scooping as many of the fragments as he could into his good hand, he deposited them gently in his jacket pocket. Behind him, Eli was squealing helplessly.</p><p>Sam heard the sound of Julia’s pistol firing several times, then she stumbled into the main room. Walter’s briefcase was firmly in her grasp as she headed for the window—and Dean.</p><p>“Will that hold two?” she demanded.</p><p>“What the eff, lady?” Dean snapped back, stepping away from her.</p><p>Seconds later, James barreled into the room, his face twisted into a canine snarl.</p><p>Behind him, the police officers stared in awe at the mortally wounded man bounding across the room. Their rifles dropped to their sides as James hurled himself into Julia, who in turn fell into Dean. The trio stumbled, off-balance, then toppled out of the open window.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Friggin’ demons! Dean’s thoughts screamed as the cold New York breeze rushed through his hair. With Julia gripped tightly to his side, he swung nearly fifteen feet out of the window before gravity whipped them back against the Waldorf s stone façade.</p><p>Under the combined weight of two people, Dean’s harness was near its breaking point. That he had started to saw through it a minute earlier certainly wasn’t helping. As they impacted the granite wall, Dean could feel Julia’s grip loosen. Given the circumstances, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if she fell, he reflected. Non-crazy ladies don’t bum-rush you next to an open window on the thirty-fifth floor.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dean spotted James clinging to a small outcropping. Guy must be built, he thought. I sure as hell couldn’t hold on to that tiny ledge. That thought was short-lived, however, as James spun toward the suspended couple and flung himself at them. He was risking a long drop if he missed,which was a good possibility considering the strong winds.</p><p>He didn’t miss. Julia’s grip slackened even further as James impacted her. The two of them flailed desperately, further straining the integrity of Dean’s harness.</p><p>“Pull me up!” Dean shouted at the open window above them. A second later, a policeman’s head popped out, but he didn’t grab the rope. Instead, twelve stories above him, Dean clocked Marco watching in shock from the roof. “Marco! Pull!”</p><p>Then Dean’s attention was drawn to the demon clawing its way upward, toward the object Julia was still clutching in one hand—the metal briefcase.</p><p>“He’s after the case! Drop it!” Dean urged, but Julia ignored him. Instead, she kicked at James, trying to dislodge him. The frayed rope connected to Dean’s harness began to twist apart, the strands snapping one by one.</p><p>“Drop it or we all die!” he yelled. Julia locked eyes with Dean, and he could see how torn she was. Guess that scroll’s just as important to them as it is to us.</p><p>“You can’t read it if you’re a corpse!” Dean asserted desperately.</p><p>Reluctantly, she held the case away from her body, as if she was about to let it drop. James dug his fingers into Dean’s legs, using them to push off toward the briefcase.</p><p>That guy’s suicidal, Dean thought. Oh wait—demon.</p><p>James thrashed through the air, grabbing the case tight and wrenching it out of Julia’s hand.</p><p>Both demon and briefcase plummeted toward the city street below.</p><p>Dean looked down at Julia, who was still barely clinging to his harness. Even with both hands free, she wouldn’t last much longer.</p><p>“You’re a crazy bitch, you know that?” he declared.</p><p>No one had noticed Eli’s exit. As the big guy’s partner dangled out of the window with the lady and the briefcase, Eli had taken the opportunity to leave the premises. He prided himself on recognizing opportunities as they presented themselves, and the opportunity to survive was an enticing one.</p><p>Upon exiting the Waldorf Astoria, Eli was thrust into a large crowd that had gathered around the security guard’s fallen body. The taxi cab the guy had landed on was totaled, its engine compartment several inches shorter than it had been a minute earlier. The sight of his body was sickening. It was as if he’d been hit by a freight train—every part of him smashed into an unrecognizable mess. Fully half of the assembled people couldn’t take their eyes off the gruesome display, while the other half gawked at the theatrics taking place 300 feet above, where the two idiots still swung perilously.</p><p>What no one seemed to notice was the steel briefcase that had landed a dozen yards from the demolished taxi.</p><p>What a day the Lord has made, Eli mused, as he casually picked up the briefcase and disappeared into the bustle of New York City.</p><p>Inside the Presidential Suite, chaos reigned. Sam had nearly jumped out of the window after his brother, but was quickly restrained by the two policemen. The room was in shambles, with broken clay, glass and furniture littering the floor. Mr. Feldman tried to relate what had happened to the officers as they cleared the adjacent rooms, but none of them could explain how the security guard had come back to life after apparently being fatally shot. It was nearly a minute before anyone else realized that Dean and Julia were still hanging outside the window.</p><p>“Everyone get back,” the older policeman ordered. “We have this under control.” The officer leaned his head out of the window and tried half-heartedly to grab the taut rope that they were dangling from.</p><p>I have to get to the roof, Sam realized. If they pull him in here, we’re going to be stuck in prison until the Apocalypse.</p><p>As the other policeman was occupied with trying to radio a dispatcher, Sam’s opportunity to escape had arrived. Leaving the main room, Sam saw Walter crawling toward the exit. He considered what Walter had said about the War Scroll: If the wrong people get their hands on it... Well, that would be bad. What were the chances that Sam and Walter were on the same side? Despite strong impulses to the contrary, Sam decided not to abandon the guy. Slinging a hand under the injured man’s arm, Sam quickly had him out of the suite and to the bank of elevators.</p><p>“Thank you...” Walter managed to gasp, his breath ragged.</p><p>“Don’t.” Sam didn’t want gratitude from the man until he had decided what to do with him. Entering the elevator, he pressed the button for the forty-seventh floor.</p><p>“Down,” Walter wheezed. “We need to get to the street.”</p><p>“Your daughter is hanging by a thread, Walter. You’re just going to abandon her?”</p><p>“She is? She’s alive?”</p><p>“Not if we don’t pull her up to the roof quick.”</p><p>They exited the elevator and worked their way up the service stairwell as fast as Walter’s damaged legs allowed. On the roof, they found a stocky, swarthy man already trying to reel in Dean and Julia.</p><p>“What in God’s creation is going on down there?” the man asked, nodding at Walter’s torn-up legs.</p><p>Sam searched for the words to explain what had just happened. As usual, the exploits of the Winchester brothers were beyond rationalization.</p><p>“Communists,” he said decisively. It was the best he could do.</p><p>“Help me lift them up.”</p><p>By that point, the rest of the window washers strapped to the side of the Waldorf Astoria had stopped working and directed their full attention to Dean and Julia. Dean had started to wall-walk horizontally away from the open window of the Presidential Suite. Sam noted at least three sets of uniformed arms reaching out of the window, indicating that backup had arrived. Won’t be long before they think to come up here, he surmised.</p><p>The mechanism for raising the suspended window washers was little more than a hand crank attached to the system of pulleys and levers. The man leaned into the crank with all his weight, but couldn’t get it to turn. Sam moved to help him, adding his strength to the guy’s considerable heft. Between the two of them, they got the crank to turn, but very slowly. It would take at least ten minutes to pull Dean and Julia up at that rate.</p><p>“Little help Walter?” Sam asked, but he could see Walter was in no shape to exert himself. His skin was pale from the blood loss. All of his energy was dedicated just to remaining upright.</p><p>“This gear ain’t designed for two,” the Italian stated.</p><p>Glancing around the roof, Sam tried to come up with another option. If he could tell which room Dean was outside of now, he could break the window and pull him inside. Of course, the police were just as likely to come up with that plan, and they were a lot closer to Dean.</p><p>“How long’s the rope?” Sam asked as mental gears clicked into place.</p><p>“Long.”</p><p>“Long enough to lower them to the ground?” The man mulled that for a beat, examining the thick coil of rope. “Should be.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t reassured but he knew they didn’t have another choice. He nodded and the two of them began rapidly unspooling the line. At ground level, a cluster of police cruisers had assembled at the 50th Street entrance.</p><p>Either way, up or down, I’m handing Dean over to the cops. Better that than waiting for him to fall, Sam thought, continuing to turn the crank.</p><p>When roughly half the line had been let out, a shotgun blast echoed between the buildings. Sam peered over the edge and saw Dean scrambling through an open window— presumably one he had just broken with the other shotgun in his duffel.</p><p>“Change of plans,” Sam called out to Walter, who was leaning woozily against the railing. “We’re going to the subway.”</p><p>Dean had chosen the window at random. That the room belonged to an attractive Asian woman was mere happy coincidence. That she was drying off after a shower had to be, in Dean’s opinion, God’s cosmic reward to him for saving Julia’s life. If there is a God, the logical half of Dean’s brain chimed in. All signs point to absentee Father.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation demanded that Dean hurry along. Though if cell phone numbers had existed in 1954, he certainly would have left his.</p><p>Dean decided that the stairwell was less of a risk than the elevator. Skipping two steps at a time, he practically galloped down the stairs, his duffel jostling on his back. Julia kept up the pace despite everything her body had just been put through. When they reached the bottom floor, Dean knew they’d have to switch stairwells—and that meant going through the lobby.</p><p>“Do you know where you’re going?” Julia demanded.</p><p>Dean’s snort was his only response.</p><p>“Because if you don’t, I’d just as soon go my own way.”</p><p>“You and me both, sugar. But if you want to get out of here a free woman, the only way is my way.” That seemed to shut her up, for the time being. “From the look of things, you royally jacked our plan back there.”</p><p>“Likewise.”</p><p>“Hey! I saved your ass. Without me, you’d be just another spot of bird poop to clean off the sidewalk.”</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s right. What have you done for me, ‘sides throwing me out of a window? I knew you were trouble the minute I saw you.”</p><p>“You wanted to sleep with me the minute you saw me,” Julia shot back.</p><p>‘But I didn’t. Because you looked like trouble.” They had arrived at the bottom floor, where a myriad voices were audible outside the stairwell door.</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Julia scowled. “You’re the one who’s ranting,” she hissed.</p><p>Timing their dash perfectly, Dean and Julia were able to slip into the Park Avenue lobby unnoticed. Most everyone had hurried outside after hearing that a man had jumped. Dean held open the door to the garage-access stairwell— but Julia was no longer behind him. Scouring the lobby, he clocked her walking toward the main entrance.</p><p>“You trying to get yourself arrested?” Dean asked as he caught up with her.</p><p>She turned to face him, now ice cold.</p><p>“I need what’s in that briefcase. You have no idea how important it is.”</p><p>“You’ve got it all backwards. I need that scroll. You don’t know how important it is. But neither of us is gonna go out there after it.”</p><p>“You can’t stop me.”</p><p>Dean leaned in intimately close. “If you’re going to go out there, at least tell me you still have your gun.”</p><p>Julia reached down to her waist, but the pistol wasn’t there. She looked mournfully out on to the street where it had fallen.</p><p>“Thought so. Let’s get one thing straight—I’m not helping you get away. You know things about the scroll, and I need to know those things too. You’re my prisoner.”</p><p>Slapping the side of his duffel, Dean smirked.</p><p>“Now unless you want to get an ass full of rock salt, how about you follow me?”</p><p>The Presidential Siding was a custom-built underground train station, constructed to allow Presidents, dignitaries and celebrities direct access to the Waldorf Astoria. Their train cars could pull directly up to the hotel, bypassing the need to secure Grand Central Terminal, or sit in New York traffic. Most of the time, the rail siding sat unused, which made it perfect for their getaway.</p><p>By the time Sam and Walter made it to the rail platform, Dean and Julia were already there. Sam wasn’t overjoyed to see Julia again after her actions upstairs, but watching the tender moment she shared with her father helped take the edge off the hostility.</p><p>“You okay, Dean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I will be, soon as we get out of here.”</p><p>Walter steadied himself against the platform wall.</p><p>“I’m almost afraid to ask, but are we meant to cross this?” He pointed at the vast expanse of tracks in front of them. Since they were underground, with almost no lighting, the tracks seemed to extend forever. A steady stream of trains was moving in and out of the area. The mayhem of Grand Central Terminal was just audible over the din of the engines.</p><p>“That’s the idea,” Sam answered. “Before anybody thinks to look down here.”</p><p>Julia’s eyes caught on her father’s pant leg, which was dripping with blood.</p><p>“He can’t dodge a train like that,” she said.</p><p>Dean pumped his shotgun with conviction. He threw the duffel at Sam.</p><p>“He doesn’t have to dodge one. He’s got to catch one,” he said.</p><p>The group made their way across the tracks in silence, none of them comfortable with their new-found fellowship. Sam noticed that Dean kept his shotgun leveled at Julia the whole time, which was probably a smart move. Even if they were playing for the same team, Julia had been a little too gung-ho during her aborted heist. He also still wondered if she had been the one to swipe the knife.</p><p>With some difficulty, they were able to hoist Walter onto the back of a south-bound train. For the first time in hours, Sam relaxed. They had completely failed in their mission, but somehow, they had survived. Seated across from him, Dean looked glum.</p><p>“What is it?” Sam asked.</p><p>Rubbing the train’s shoddy upholstery with distaste, Dean sighed.</p><p>“I miss the Impala.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>James McMannon felt as if a heavy burden was lifting off his back. A white light appeared before him, and he wanted to go toward it.</p><p>There was an eruption of noise.</p><p>The light disappeared. James forced his eyes open. In front of him, he could see a wavering group of people—they looked like they were in an enormous, swirling heat devil— as if they were caught in the hot air that rose off the black streets of the city in the middle of summer.</p><p>He heard a voice in his left ear.</p><p>“Hey. Stay still, the ambulance is coming.”</p><p>James thought he was answering to the voice, but he realized that all he could hear was ringing. Then he saw that white light again. He got up, at least he thought he did, and walked toward its beckoning glimmer.</p><p>At that moment, everything that James McMannon had every thought, felt, or loved left his body.</p><p>All that was left was the animal.</p><p>In all of Hank Caprezie’s years on the force, he had never seen a man fall thirty floors and live, but here he was. And he was one of the family, a security guard.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay?” Hank peered into the guy’s eyes. “You need to go to the hospital, stay still.”</p><p>Without responding, the man slid himself off the crushed taxi. Standing in the middle of the crowd, he looked around, as though searching for something. His neck was at an unnatural angle, which he corrected by grasping it on both sides and twisting his head back into place. When he turned back to Hank, his eyes were pitch black. Hank took an involuntary step back.</p><p>“Hey man, I really think you should stay!” Hank called.</p><p>The guy didn’t listen. Instead, he walked toward the throng of people and disappeared.</p><p>I’m going to have a hell of a time explaining this to the captain, Hank thought.</p><p>Dean spent the train ride trying to interrogate Walter and Julia. Unfortunately for him, they weren’t talking. It was clear they knew much more about the scrolls than Walter had let on in his meeting with Sam, but their motivations were still hazy. Do they want to protect the scrolls, or destroy them? Dean wondered. It was possible that they were all on the same side, working toward the exact same goal, but without more information from Walter and Julia, Dean had no way of knowing.</p><p>When the group got off the train in lower Manhattan, the bleeding from Walter’s leg had slowed, but he was still in need of a doctor’s care. They looked at one another. They didn’t have the scrolls, nor any idea how to find them. They had reached an impasse.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean, his feelings obvious. It’s time to go.</p><p>Just like that, the Winchesters turned and started walking uptown.</p><p>“You’re just going to leave us here?” Julia cried. “I thought I was your prisoner?”</p><p>Dean turned on his heel. “I release you. And from what I can tell, sweet cheeks, you’ll do fine on your own. Both of you.”</p><p>“You’re going to need us,” Julia called as Walter faltered a step. Sam’s face registered a slight flash of sympathy. What Julia really meant, of course, was that she needed them. Are we really going to leave a bleeding old man on the street, especially if his daughter might be in possession of our stolen knife?</p><blockquote><p>Dean punched him in the shoulder. “Let’s get going.” Apparently, they were.</p></blockquote><p>That evening, Sam and Dean checked into a dive hotel on the Lower East Side. With all the chaos they had caused at the Waldorf that day, it was too much of a risk to go back to the apartment, even if they had used aliases. They bought a pizza and took it back to their room. Despite their exhaustion, they still had to eat, and neither of them was in the mood for the human interaction a restaurant visit would require.</p><p>Sam wondered how much Walter and Julia really knew. It seemed likely now that they had been the ones to ransack the Villard House apartment, and Walter had spoken at length about the scrolls at the Bible Society. But did they know the true significance of the War Scroll? Could they possibly comprehend how important it was for Sam and Dean to take possession of it?</p><p>Neither of them knew any of the answers. All they knew was that in the morning, they’d come up with a new plan. Until then, they’d eat pizza and bask in the hopelessness of their cause.</p><p>Long past nightfall, Dean stepped out onto the building’s front stoop. Sam was already there, staring quietly at the black sky.</p><p>“Can’t see stars for shit here,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam’s lips curled into a half-smile—the one he reserved for Dean’s attempts to cheer him up.</p><p>“I hadn’t noticed.”</p><p>“Good work today, Sammy.”</p><p>“Good work? We got hosed, Dean. We had to run away with our tails between our legs, and now we don’t even have a clue where the scroll is. For all we know, it really was destroyed.”</p><p>“You kept it together in there. Me, I wouldn’t have taken well to Julia barging in like that.”</p><p>Sam nodded. Then, after a moment’s silence, said, “Dean... is that a shotgun down your pants?”</p><p>Seemingly out of nowhere, Dean produced the shotgun, then hid it once more down the back of his jeans.</p><p>“After everything, I wanted to keep it handy. But I don’t want to get arrested for firearm possession after what we got away with today.”</p><p>“Actually, I think the only real crime was destruction of property,” Sam said, thinking back.</p><p>“Plus breaking and entering.”</p><p>“And resisting arrest.”</p><p>“And assault with a deadly weapon.”</p><p>Sam’s brow furrowed in confusion. “When was that? I didn’t shoot anybody that wasn’t a demon.”</p><p>Dean smirked. “I shot you.”</p><p>That was enough to get a small laugh out of Sam.</p><p>“Sorry about that, by the way.”</p><p>Sam reached for his neck, where tiny bits of glass and rock salt were no doubt still embedded.</p><p>“No, Dean, I’m the one who should be sorry.”</p><p>“Hey now, let’s not start with this. One ‘I’m sorry’ is the daily limit.”</p><p>“I’m serious. I’m sorry I brought us here. We didn’t know what we were getting into, and now...”</p><p>“Now we’re stuck, is that what you’re getting at?”</p><p>“Maybe. What if Don leaves us here to rot, chasing after a scroll that doesn’t exist?”</p><p>“No angel douche is gonna leave me stranded with the Cleavers. We’ll find a way, Sam. I promise you that.”</p><p>They sat quietly for a minute, then Sam said hesitantly, “Am I a coward?”</p><p>Dean didn’t know how to respond to that. In the end he just said, “No.”</p><p>“I mean, if it was you. If you knew the fight could be won, and all it took was your life—“</p><p>“That’s not all it takes, Sam.”</p><p>Sam nodded, but Dean could tell he wasn’t satisfied.</p><p>“That’s not all it takes. You saying ‘yes’ to Lucifer isn’t just about giving up your life, it’s about giving up everything. Letting the angels have their way with the Earth, with what’s rightfully ours. Sam, if I could say ‘yes’ to Michael and end this here and now, I would in an instant, but we both know it ain’t that simple.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean saying ‘yes.’ I meant...”</p><p>“What? Out with it.”</p><p>“I don’t know. Nevermind.”</p><p>“You’re tired. We both are. Get some rest, it’ll make more sense in the morning.”</p><p>When Dean reached the door, he looked back at his brother, still seated on the front steps. In so many ways, Sam would forever be the little boy that Dean had spent his entire youth protecting. A familiar fear raced through his mind. The same fear that had plagued him for months. More than anything else, Dean feared that Sam wasn’t strong enough.</p><p>He feared that, when the time came, Sam would say “Yes.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam didn’t want to dream. He cherished the opportunity to sleep—it was the dreams that were the problem. After what he’d seen and experienced as a hunter, any therapist would expect his slumbering visions to be horrific—monsters, demons, death and dismemberment—but any of those things would be welcome in place of what he did dream about. Family. His brother, his father, even his mother, who had died before he could walk. They were the figures that filled his dreams, living happy lives, untouched by the dark plans of Azazel, Lilith, and Lucifer.</p><p>Untouched by Sam’s own actions. Breaking the Final Seal. The Apocalypse. The End of Everything. For months on end, the dreams were the same. The Winchester family sitting around a dinner table telling mundane stories about their small problems. Normal problems. Dean was younger, maybe seventeen years old, not yet the independent adult man he was in 2010. John was a mechanic, working long hours, but relishing every moment of it. Mary was... alive. What else mattered? Almost everything was exactly how Sam had imagined it as a child, while sitting alone in dank motel rooms waiting for John to come back from a hunt.</p><p>The only difference? Sam wasn’t there. Their perfect life was only possible because he didn’t exist. No Sam meant no yellow-eyed demon coming in the night, no fire destroying the house, no death sentence for Mary. No need for John’s twenty-year path to revenge. No meeting Jessica, no reason for her to become Azazel’s next victim. Sam couldn’t close his eyes without seeing it. Somewhere out there, Jessica could have been happy and alive without him.</p><p>Sam didn’t want to dream. Simple unconsciousness suited him much better.</p><p>In the morning, Sam and Dean gathered what little stuff they had with them and headed out. They decided that Sam would try to get back into the American Bible Society to see if he could find any information in Walter’s office. Meanwhile Dean was going to try to track down James the demon security guard. If he really was a ‘guard dog,’ he might lead them straight to the scrolls.</p><p>Sneaking into the American Bible Society was relatively straightforward. The rear entrance was locked, but Sam used one of his credit cards and picked it with ease. That’s an advantage of working in 1954, Sam thought. They’re not as paranoid about security. He briefly considered the possibility that the police hadn’t yet been to Walter’s workplace, but that was unlikely. Mr. Feldman knew Walter’s real name— indeed it was probably his distinction in the field that had convinced Mr. Feldman to let him bid in the first place.</p><p>Entering the busy maze of small passageways at the back of the building, it was nearly impossible to avoid encountering people. Luckily, every scholar he passed had their nose in a book.</p><p>Still, got to move fast.</p><p>Reaching Walter’s office, Sam found the place in chaos. Books littered the floor, a massive shelf was upended and resting at an angle across Walter’s desk, and his typewriter had been smashed to pieces.</p><p>Sam swung the door closed, hoping that no one would be curious enough to come looking through the ransacked room.</p><p>From behind a bookcase, he heard a voice.</p><p>“Don’t come any closer!”</p><p>Walter peeked over the edge of the fallen furniture.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Sam asked.</p><p>“It’s my office,” Walter said, emerging and looking around. “Or at least it was my office.”</p><p>Sam noticed that he had clean pants on but was still struggling to put weight on his right leg particularly.</p><p>“Who did this?” Sam asked. “Cops?”</p><p>Walter shook his head. “The police came and went yesterday afternoon, according to one of my colleagues. This must have happened during the night.”</p><p>“So you made some friends yesterday,” Sam said.</p><p>“It would seem so.” Walter opened the notebook that he was holding. “Anyway, I couldn’t sleep last night. I’ve been here since four. I keep seeing that... thing.”</p><p>“James—the security guard?”</p><p>“That thing wasn’t a person. Doesn’t deserve to be called a person’s name. What about you? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Sam perched on the edge of the ruined desk.</p><p>“What do you know about demonology, Walter?”</p><p>The scholar swallowed, grimacing.</p><p>“It’s part of the Christian faith.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And I’ve read the Bible. I’ve read all the apocryphal texts. I know what they say about demons, I just—“</p><p>“Didn’t think you’d ever see one?” Sam offered.</p><p>Walter avoided Sam’s gaze. “My colleagues call this sort of talk ‘occult’—‘hidden,’ out of the ordinary man’s view. How is it that you know so much about it, Sam?”</p><p>“You could say I’m a bit of a scholar, like you. I just go about my research a little differently. More ‘hands on.’”</p><p>“So how does one kill a demon?” Walter asked.</p><p>Sam remembered Ruby’s knife, which was the quickest way of dispatching a demon. Has Julia got it? he wondered again. If Sam told Walter the knife’s purpose, it was possible he and Julia would go after James without Sam and Dean’s help. It seemed sensible to keep some information hidden.</p><p>Don’t give Walter too much rope. Or he could strangle you with it.</p><p>“There are ways,” Sam finally replied.</p><p>Nodding, Walter flipped his sketch over so Sam could see it. In broad gray strokes, Walter had laid out the basic shape of a hellish-looking canine creature, its snarling teeth dripping with blood. It uncannily resembled the mental picture Sam had of a Hellhound.</p><p>“Not drawing a kids’ book, huh?”</p><p>“For a second, while it was attacking me, I could swear it...” Walter stopped, collecting his thoughts. “I could swear it changed. Became something else.” He tapped the drawing with the pencil. “This.”</p><p>Now it was Sam who was confused.</p><p>“What do you mean, like a shifter?” He caught himself, remembering that Walter wouldn’t have a clue that shapeshifters existed. “I mean, did it physically change shape? Grow fur?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. I was distracted by all the scratching and biting.”</p><p>Sam took the notebook from Walter, squinting closely at the hellish image.</p><p>“I take it that’s not the typical demon’s M.O.?” Walter asked.</p><p>“No. Not at all.” What the hell kind of creature was this—could it be a Hellhound?</p><p>“You recognize it?”</p><p>Images of Lilith’s white eyes flitted through Sam’s memory.</p><p>“Kind of,” Sam said. “Do any of your books ever mention Hellhounds?”</p><p>Walter shook his head, no.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising, given the mythological nature of the beasts. Their connection to Christian theology was tenuous at best.</p><p>“You’ve run into one before?” Walter asked.</p><p>“We’ve run into a lot of things.”</p><p>As Sam pondered the possibilities, he realized a particularly dire one. In 1954, Lilith was still alive, probably roaming the earth, eating babies, as was her wont. Could she, or the yellow-eyed demon for that matter, be involved with this strange creature? Sam decided it was worth giving Walter a few more scraps of information.</p><p>“Hellhounds are brutal, fearless creatures. They’re Hell’s enforcers.”</p><p>“What, like, if you make a deal with the Devil?” Walter joked.</p><p>“Yes. Exactly.”</p><p>Walter blanched. “Oh.”</p><p>“The last time we saw one, it was obeying a very powerful demon named Lilith. She’s actually the reason we’re in this situation—“ Sam stopped when he saw the strange look on Walter’s face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Lilith?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“The demon Lilith, the first demon, Lilith.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“You’ve met her?” Walter asked, his voice excited.</p><p>“I killed her,” Sam answered. Well, more or less.</p><p>For a second Walter was silent. Then he rubbed his hands over his notebook as he began to speak, half to himself, as though talking through a math problem.</p><p>“There’s lore about Lilith, you know. That she has a demonic dog as a companion.” Walter eyed Sam. “I may have never seen a demon, but I know my Bible, and it seems like that could be what nearly took my leg off yesterday.”</p><p>“It may have a dog’s bite, but it looked like a regular guy,” Sam said.</p><p>“Young man, we are talking about thousands of years of human history. Where Lucifer, demons and angels all inhabited the same dark universe. I would think those entities could think up whatever they damn well wanted to.”</p><p>Sam nodded, he knew that all too well.</p><p>“Do you know what it says? The War of the Sons?” Sam pressed.</p><p>“If I did, I wouldn’t need to steal it.”</p><p>“How do you know it’s important enough to steal without knowing what it says?” Sam persisted. “I mean, why were you after the War Scroll specifically, and not the rest of the set?”</p><p>“The rest of the Dead Sea Scrolls are phenomenally important, just not in the same way,” Walter said, bypassing Sam’s first question.</p><p>“Walter, you and I went through something yesterday that would send most people running for the hills, but here we both are. It seems as if we might be after the same thing. Either we can share information, or—“</p><p>“Live together, die alone?” Walter interrupted. “We don’t trust you. Julia nor me.”</p><p>“Well, no offense Walter, but we trust you two even less, and for better reasons,” Sam said. “So what do you know about the scrolls?”</p><p>Walter sighed. He seemed to contemplate his next sentence very carefully. “I know the War Scroll is important, because... because I’ve been waiting for it my entire life.”</p><p>“What, like you were destined to find it?”</p><p>“I don’t have a destiny,” Walter said. “All I had was a mother, who told me a story when I was little, the same one every night. A story about the day that good would finally triumph over evil, and how if I was lucky, I’d get to see that day.” Sam leaned forward, intrigued. “And if I was very, very lucky, I’d get to be a part of that battle.”</p><p>Sam’s jaw clenched. “Doesn’t sound that lucky to me.”</p><p>“The War Scroll is how good triumphs in that final battle. It’s a set of instructions, written thousands of years ago, by incredibly devout Jews during Roman rule in Judea. The Essenes spent their days in solitude, transcribing the Word of God. Some believe they were His prophets.”</p><p>“And you believe it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I never knew my mother to lie to me.”</p><p>Sam knew all about destiny, and about the weight of a parent’s expectations. It seemed as if Walter had allowed himself to be pushed down the path his mother had planned for him.</p><p>“Walter, I think we can help each other,” Sam said softly. “Why don’t you gather your stuff and come with me?”</p><p>“Right, my things...” Walter absently drummed his fingers on the notebook with the sort of deep deliberation that Sam didn’t see very often. Not from Dean, anyway.</p><p>“Wait,” Walter said suddenly, his eyes wide. He hastily pushed aside a pile of dusty tomes, revealing a much larger work underneath. It was roughly ten inches by twelve, set in a thick leather cover. As Walter flipped the yellowed pages, Sam could see they were filled with Enochian, the language of the angels. “Pages are missing,” Walter said, in despair. “Without them, I won’t be able to translate the scroll.”</p><p>“If the pages are gone, we’ll just have to—“</p><p>“No,” Walter said, voice filled with new hope, “I don’t think they would have found it.”</p><p>He led Sam through a small door in the back of the office.</p><p>“It’s in the toilet?” Sam said, seeing the tiny private bathroom.</p><p>Walter smiled broadly as he fumbled through a rack of magazines. Hidden amongst them was another ancient volume, with the thickness of a dictionary. If its cover once held a title, it had long since faded.</p><p>“You keep that in the pisser?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Slipping into one of his most-often used aliases, an FBI agent, Dean visited the 51^st^ Precinct and got James’s last known address. His sister’s house in Queens. Great.</p><p>Dean hopped onto the subway and made the twenty-minute journey to the outer borough.</p><p>Burnt-out candles covered the front steps of the McMannon residence. Dean wondered if the vigil was for James, or if there was something else going on that he didn’t yet understand.</p><p>Knocking on the front door, Dean again pulled out his FBI badge. The woman who eventually opened the door looked battered and used up, her days-old makeup was smeared down her face. She had clearly spent the night weeping.</p><p>“Sorry to disturb you, ma’am,” Dean said kindly. “I’m Agent Page with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”</p><p>The woman wiped a little mascara from the corner of her eye. “You’d better come in.”</p><p>The woman led him inside, where he found Julia sat on the living room couch, smiling like a wolf.</p><p>The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Doyle. “And this is Miss Sands,” she added, nodding at Julia. “The police sent her to visit me and check on my well-being. But I expect you’d know all about that.”</p><p>“I’m not sure, Madam,” Dean said, raising an eyebrow at Julia. “It seems strange that they would send such a young lady to do such an important job.”</p><p>“Oh, I know,” Mrs. Doyle said. “But she has been very kind.”</p><p>Julia glared at Dean. Ignoring her, Dean looked around the dark and pokey interior of Mrs. Doyle’s home—it was stuffed floor-to-ceiling with religious icons. The deep irony struck Dean immediately. The world could be cruel.</p><p>Dean took a seat opposite Julia. She had beaten him here. Somehow. Dean didn’t like how the day was going.</p><p>“Can I offer you a cup of tea?” Mrs. Doyle said, shuffling in from the kitchen.</p><p>Dean smiled politely and took the saucer and cup from her.</p><p>“Would you mind telling me when you last saw James McMannon?”</p><p>“I’ve already told the detectives everything I know,” she mumbled in reply. “He left with Barney to go to work, and neither of them came home that night.”</p><p>“Barney?” Dean asked.</p><p>“... My son.”</p><p>“Of course,” Dean replied gently, feeling for the woman. He was certain her son was already dead. “But James reported for work the next day?”</p><p>Mrs. Doyle broke eye contact with Dean, and began turning a Saint Christopher medallion over in her hands. “Yes.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a suspicious look. “Madam, have you been in contact with James?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“The only way we can find your son is if we know everything,” Dean persisted gently.</p><p>Mrs. Doyle recoiled in horror, her lip quivering intensely. She looked like she was on the verge of total emotional collapse.</p><p>“But...”</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“How could you not know? The detectives, they found...” she trailed off, tears spilling freely down her face. “They found his body.”</p><p>Smooth, Dean. Although Sam was the more emotionally sensitive of the Winchester brothers, Dean’s heart wasn’t made of stone. Mrs. Doyle had lost everything she had, and it was already too late for Dean to help her. After the gunshot wound and the fall that James had sustained, his host wouldn’t survive once the demon left his body. To all intents and purposes, James was just as dead as Barney.</p><p>“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Doyle,” Dean said sincerely. “Of course, had I known...”</p><p>“You wouldn’t be wasting your time talking to me,” the woman finished.</p><p>“That’s not true,” Dean said. “I’ve still got some questions about James.”</p><p>Mrs. Doyle’s face went even whiter, but she nodded okay.</p><p>“He ever come home acting strangely? Like he was drunk, or not himself?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“He hang out with any shady characters? People that weren’t so... wholesome?” he asked, pointing at the largest crucifix in the room.</p><p>“He’s a good man.”</p><p>“You don’t think it’s possible he’s involved with this?”</p><p>“He’s a victim. I know it. Both of them are.”</p><p>“Did James go to church with you, Mrs. Doyle?”</p><p>She nodded, hesitantly.</p><p>“But not every week,” Dean stated flatly.</p><p>“Some Sundays he’d have work.”</p><p>Julia leaned in and grasped the woman’s shaking hands.</p><p>“It’s terrible this has happened to your family, Mrs. Doyle. But if James was here this morning, then you need to tell the agent.”</p><p>Where’s she getting that from? Dean wondered. Was he missing something obvious here?</p><p>Mrs. Doyle faltered under Julia’s scrutiny.</p><p>“He didn’t do anything wrong, I just know it. Please don’t hurt him.”</p><p>I’ll be damned, Dean thought. Julia’s good for something after all.</p><p>“Was he here? Did he say anything?” Julia continued her grilling.</p><p>“No. He didn’t say much at all... That was the strange part. He came in, looking a real mess, went upstairs. I heard him shuffling around. Then he came back down and did something, I don’t know, not like him.”</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“He asked if I knew how to get to the train station. But that’s not how he said it. It was like he didn’t know the word he was looking for.”</p><p>“And why is that strange?” Julia queried, moving forward in her seat.</p><p>“Well, because he worked at Grand Central Station for fifteen years as a desk clerk. How could he not know where it was?”</p><p>Julia and Dean exchanged glances. That was strange indeed.</p><p>“That was before you heard from the detective?” Julia asked.</p><p>Mrs. Doyle nodded sadly. “I don’t know where he’s going. I just don’t want him to get hurt.” She looked at Dean desperately. “Promise me you won’t hurt him.”</p><p>“We just want to bring your brother back. That’s all.” If only that were true.</p><p>Dean followed Julia out of the dimly lit house and into the bright morning sun in a somber mood. Whatever the demon’s interest in the scroll, it was clear he was willing to kill.</p><p>“How the hell did you get here before me?” he demanded as soon as they were out of earshot of the house. “And what the hell are you doing?”</p><p>Julia accelerated her pace, leaving Dean struggling to keep up.</p><p>“Hey! I’m talking to you,” Dean said, grabbing her elbow.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Julia asked spinning around angrily. “You stop us from getting the scrolls, then you come barging in on my interview. You’re like a bull dressed in heels in a china shop. Skidding around, and breaking everything in its wake.”</p><p>“You’d never find me in heels.” Dean said, scowling. Then he smiled. “Listen, it’s clear we’re both after the same thing. And even though you’re obnoxious, it seems to me we’d be better off working together.”</p><p>“I get the jump on you one time and you want to team up?”</p><p>“I don’t need your help. I just don’t want to have to kill you.”</p><p>“Why should I team up with you? I’m always ahead of you, Dean Winchester.” Julia smiled, holding up Dean’s wallet. “And here I’ve been writing my love letters to Malcolm Young...”</p><p>Dean felt his jacket for his wallet.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he gasped. “Impressive. Not very many women can dip like that.”</p><p>“I’m not most women. That FBI shield is a piece of crap, by the way, totally unrealistic.” Julia stopped in front of the steps leading up to the raised subway platform.</p><p>“So what do you say? Partners?” Even as he said the words, Dean knew he was going to have trouble convincing Sam. Even though his brother was always the more trusting of the two, knowing Sam, he wouldn’t want other people to get hurt finding their way out of this mess.</p><p>Julia surveyed Dean. “I guess. For now.” She turned and took the stairs two at a time.</p><p>“Hey, how did you know?” Dean asked, following her.</p><p>“Know what?”</p><p>“That James had been there.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? The whole place smelled like wet dog.”</p><p>Dean pushed coins into the payphone on the subway platform. He waited for the operator and then asked for the Turtle Bay hotel, room thirty-three. Dean listened as the desk clerk rang up to the third floor. In that era, it seemed some hotels only had one telephone per level. Through the receiver, Dean heard his brother’s heavy footfall as he approached.</p><p>“Dean? What’s going on?”</p><p>“Meet me at Grand Central. The guard dog is taking a train today. Don’t know where or what time.”</p><p>“When are you going to get there?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Soon as I can. I’m at 111th street in Queens. Oh, and Sam? I might have company.”</p><p>“Um... I was going to say the same thing,” Sam admitted. “Walter was at his office. He has a book, and some ideas about what is possessing James.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Julia got to James’s sister before I did. Anyway, we’ll meet you at Grand Central.”</p><p>Sam hung up and retreated back to the room where Walter was rewrapping his injured leg with clean gauze.</p><p>“We’ve got to meet Julia and Dean at Grand Central.”</p><p>Walter looked up, surprised. “Grand Central? Is that where the scrolls are?”</p><p>“Seems guard dog James is taking a train ride. We need to follow him, he’s our only lead.”</p><p>“Well then, let’s go.”</p><p>Sam stuffed the shotguns into the bottom of the duffel bag and put his and Dean’s 2010 clothes on top. They’d used the clothes to conceal the shape of the weapons in the bag on their way to the Waldorf, which turned out to be fortuitous, since they hadn’t been able to return to their apartment. Walter had taken a small suitcase from his office. It was empty, but could hold the scrolls when and if they found them.</p><p>“How much money do you have?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Not much. Three dollars.” Walter said, looking through his worn leather wallet.</p><p>Sam looked at the window and the fire escape beyond it. They were going to have to hoof it out the back. There was no telling who was watching the hotel. Plus, Sam didn’t want to pay for two nights. He opened up the creeky, dust-laden window. Down below, a large dumpster was about twenty feet too far away from them. It was going to be difficult getting an old man with a leg injury out of the window.</p><p>“I can make it,” Walter reassured Sam.</p><p>The two men scrambled down the fire escape to the platform that hung about twenty-five feet in the air. Sam was six-foot four—that meant he still had to drop nineteen feet to the ground. He hit the uneven pavement hard.</p><p>“You okay?” Walter called.</p><p>Sam gave him a thumbs up, and then rolled the dumpster underneath the fire escape. Walter slowly let himself down, dropping with a thud. Sam pulled him off the dumpster and they hurried to the sidewalk.</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Julia and Dean sat in silence on the train. She had grabbed a newspaper that had been left on the seat and behaved as though she was engrossed in its contents. Dean watched her with curiosity out of the corner of his eye. Here was a woman who was just as comfortable holding a gun in people’s faces and just as good at getting information out of them as he was. Dean shuddered a bit—She’s just like me, but hotter.</p><p>Not being someone to let a tender moment go undisturbed, Dean leaned over her shoulder.</p><p>“What you reading?”</p><p>“The Times. Do you mind?” Julia turned the page and tried to ignore him.</p><p>He scooted closer, and she moved away.</p><p>“Aw, come on, don’t be like that,” Dean whispered. “I’m reading too.”</p><p>Julia peeled off a page of the paper and passed it to him.</p><p>“You gave me the comics.”</p><p>Julia’s small heart-shaped face beamed.</p><p>“Kids like the comics.”</p><p>Some twenty minutes later, the conductor announced that they were pulling into Grand Central Terminal.</p><p>Dean and Julia alighted from the train and quickly found Sam and Walter waiting for them underneath the large concourse sign. They all eyed each other suspiciously.</p><p>“So, now what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We know he’s getting on a train,” Dean said, “we just don’t know which one.” Hundreds of people were rushing to make afternoon trains back to the suburbs, clogging the station’s hallways. There were dozens of possible destinations, and none of them seemed more likely than any other.</p><p>“Okay, well let’s just think a moment,” Julia said as she studied the departure board. “James is after the scrolls, right? But why?”</p><p>“Your dad and I were asking ourselves that,” Sam said, and Julia shot a look at her father. “James isn’t possessed by a typical demon,” Sam continued, “but something more like a guard dog.”</p><p>“Okay, but the question is why?” Walter said.</p><p>“Someone put the guard-dog demon in with the scrolls. I saw a symbol on one of the jars, something we see quite often.” Sam meant the Devil’s Trap he had seen on the inside of the lid on one of the jars. “The symbol traps a demon inside it, and we can only assume that James accidentally released the demon and it possessed him. And it seems that it will go to every length to protect the scroll.”</p><p>“Dad, did you know this?” Julia looked at her father with a glint of anger in her eyes. “Did you know they were cursed?”</p><p>“I didn’t know for sure,” Walter admitted.</p><p>Julia turned away from her father, clearly miffed that he hadn’t told her about the hidden danger.</p><p>“Was there anyone at the auction that you recognized, Julia?” Sam asked, trying to anticipate where James could be going.</p><p>“Well, there was one guy, but everything was moving so quickly.”</p><p>“Who?” Walter asked.</p><p>Julia searched in her purse and pulled out a billfold.</p><p>“The guy in the piano bar.”</p><p>Dean stared at her incredulously. “The guy whose wallet you lifted was at the auction? Why didn’t you tell us before now?”</p><p>Julia shrugged. “I lift a lot of wallets.”</p><p>Dean took the wallet. Inside was a California license.</p><p>“Eli Thurman, Berkeley address.”</p><p>“Wait, Eli the red-head?” Sam asked. “He disappeared right after the case fell. Slipped out while the cops were going after you guys.”</p><p>“That’s as good a guess as we can make,” Dean said. “We in agreement?”</p><p>Walter nodded, then, after a pause, Julia agreed.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said. “‘Cause if we weren’t, I was going to ditch your asses. Let’s find that train.”</p><p>The four stepped up to the ticket counter and asked which train was leaving for California. The ticket clerk looked over his schedule.</p><p>“Not to California direct. Goes to Albany, Detroit, then Chicago. Then there is a Chicago-San Fran, the Overland Route.”</p><p>“Good enough. Four tickets, please.” Sam gestured for Julia to pay.</p><p>“I don’t have enough money for that,” Julia whispered.</p><p>“One hundred dollars and two cents,” the ticket guy said as he eyed the strange quartet. “You’ll have to re-ticket in Chicago.”</p><p>Dean drew his face close to Julia’s.</p><p>“Between all of those wallets, you don’t have a hundred bucks?”</p><p>“My father and I live off of these!” Julia hissed. When Dean didn’t relent, she stuffed her hand into her purse. “Fine. Give me a second.”</p><p>Instead of cash, she pulled out a locker key. She walked over to a bank of steel lockers running alongside one of the station walls. Popping open a locker, Julia took out a large leather suitcase. She popped the clasps on the case and took a pair of socks from inside. She then returned to the group carrying the case. She pulled out a wad of cash from the socks and handed it to her father.</p><p>“That’s living in style,” Dean whispered to Sam.</p><p>“Two tickets in a sleeper car,” Walter said to the clerk. He took some of the bills and shoved them over the ticket counter, then looked at Dean and Sam. “You boys find your own way.”</p><p>The brothers were speechless. These dicks don’t understand who they’re dealing with, Dean thought. Walter took the tickets and led Julia away by the arm. Dean and Sam managed to lock step with them.</p><p>“You like jumping on moving trains,” Walter growled. “Here’s another opportunity.”</p><p>On the train platform, Julia pointed out Eli Thurman’s red hair. He was holding a large leather suitcase, which was wide enough to house at least four of the jars. James the security guard wasn’t far behind—he was skulking around a steel pillar, keeping out of sight of Eli.</p><p>He looked as if he’d been dragged through Hell and back. I know how that is, buddy, Dean thought.</p><p>The plan was that Walter and Julia would check into their sleeper car and keep an eye on Eli. Sam and Dean were instructed to jump down to the other side of the tracks and, once the train pulled out, they could run alongside and jump on board, ticket free. The only thing they had to do was keep moving if they saw a ticket guy, because he would ask for their names and car number.</p><p>When the porters weren’t looking, Sam and Dean walked to the end of the train and dropped down from the platform onto the rails. The platform was about chin high, giving them lots of cover to sneak around to the other side of the caboose.</p><p>“Not quite first class accommodations,” Dean said as he moved along the other side of the train, trying to pick a good area where they would have enough time to run and enough train to catch once it started to pull out.</p><p>“What do you think they make of us?” Sam asked as he and Dean walked through the filthy underbelly of the tracks.</p><p>“I don’t know. You’re the one that made friends with Wally the Wonder Professor.”</p><p>“He’s a scholar, Dean. He understands the Bible, he can read Aramaic or whatever those scrolls are written in. Once we get that scroll he’s going to be useful.”</p><p>“Have you thought that these are regular people— well, sort of? They don’t handle the idea of possession, Satan and Armageddon well. You didn’t tell them about Armageddon did you?” Dean turned around, his eyes boring into his brother.</p><p>Sam moved past him, clipping him with the duffle bag.</p><p>“No, I didn’t Dean. Jeez.” Sam kept walking into the tunnel. Dean sighed, and followed him into the darkness.</p><p>Even though Leanne Keeny was almost a full head taller, she still struggled to follow Rose McGraw’s quick step to the penthouse. Rose’s large bottom swung from side to side, a movement that would have made any sailor think of home. Leanne on the other hand was lithe and leggy, a farm girl who had escaped to the big city. Getting a maid position at the Waldorf was a big thing, and her first real job besides castrating horses on her parents’ farm.</p><p>Leanne tried to concentrate as Rose explained that the Waldorf Astoria expects every employee to respect each guest’s privacy. Rose leaned closer, her onion breath making Leanne cringe. Rose said conspiratorially that once Joe DiMaggio was here with another woman, not Marilyn, but Leanne didn’t hear it from her. Rose wiggled her red eyebrows to further emphasize how confidential that information was.</p><p>At the penthouse door, Rose dug into her apron pocket and pulled out the maid’s skeleton key. She knocked, and then slipped the key into the latch.</p><p>The place was a mess, the shootout at the auction the day before had left everything in a shambles. Tufts of fluff dotted all the silk couches, there was blood on the Oriental rug and strange scratches on the floor, furniture was turned over—it was a war zone. Rose clucked her tongue, she needed to go get Maintenance. She told Leanne to get started cleaning up the pieces of glass. She would be back in a couple of minutes.</p><p>Leanne looked around the room. Then she pulled a waste bin from the maid’s cart, and got down on her hands and knees with a dustpan and brush. As she swept up the shards of glass, she noticed they weren’t actually glass but clay. Leanne pushed them into the basket. As she shifted her weight, she noticed in the other room that a jar had rolled underneath the bed, half obscured by the ruffled bedspread.</p><p>Leanne pulled the jar from its hiding place and carried it into the main room. She peaked outside to make sure Rose wasn’t coming down the hallway, then set the jar on the table. It was tall and oblong, and the same dusty color as all the pieces that littered the floor. Leanne thought that surely the owner would be happy that one of the jars wasn’t broken.</p><p>Then curiosity got the better of her. She dug her nails into the seam of the jar. At first, the lid wouldn’t give, it was stuck by some sort of tar-like substance. Finally, it twisted a bit and Leanne managed to separate it from the jar. Beneath it was a horsehair stopper formed with more tar. Leanne looked around for something to pry the stopper off. She spotted a letter opener on the floor and shoved that between the seal and the lip. A whooshing sound escaped from the jar.</p><p>Leanne was knocked to the floor, her legs splayed akimbo, as a dark, thick smoke poured out of the jar, taking shape on the floor. It grew larger and broader, almost to full human size. Leanne tried to pull herself up, but the black smoke enveloped her ankles—it felt like her legs were caught in two tons of wet cement.</p><p>The last thing Leanne remembered was the acrid smoke shooting up into her mouth and forcing itself down her throat.</p><p>Ten minutes later, when Rose returned to the room with Sal the maintenance guy, Leanne was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Children these days. You just can’t trust them. Leaving the job on the first day. My stars,” Rose sighed.</p><p>Sal nodded his head in agreement and they went about their business cleaning up the Presidential Suite.</p><p>At first Anthony didn’t notice the leggy blonde girl as she rushed into the Roman Art wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum got hundreds of visitors a day, and he thought she was just in a rush to meet up with the group of elementary school children who were wandering around on a class field trip. It wasn’t until he heard the sound of glass breaking that he decided to step into the hall and take a look around.</p><p>The girl stood in the middle of the hall. At her feet lay the remains of a glass case that housed several Roman jars from about 70 AD, if Anthony recalled correctly. As he watched, she pushed another glass case over and grabbed the pottery jars one by one, smashing them to the ground.</p><p>A column of smoke began to rise from each of the smashed jars. Anthony’s first thought was to find a fire extinguisher, but then the woman moved to another case and did the same thing.</p><p>“Hey lady, you can’t do that!” Anthony labored toward her, reaching for his gun. “Stop it or I’ll shoot.”</p><p>The woman didn’t seem to hear him. She turned on her heel and pulled at a long case displaying a half-dozen small silver boxes. The case toppled and broke. Puffs of smoke rose from the boxes.</p><p>Anthony aimed his pistol at her. “I mean it ma’am. Don’t touch another case!”</p><p>The woman turned toward him. Her eyes were pure black.</p><p>“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!” Anthony exclaimed fearfully as he instinctively squeezed the trigger. The shot hit her in the shoulder. Children screamed and ran out of the room. But the bullet hole didn’t even slow her down. She pulled over another case, and more smoke filled the air. Columns of greasy vapor drifted down the hall where the cases had been smashed, seeming to rise and move with a will of their own.</p><p>Anthony stepped closer. A pillar of smoke billowed up in front of him. That was the last thing he remembered.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean noticed the train moved faster than he thought it would.</p><p>“Come on, Sam,” Dean shouted as he pulled himself onto one of the ladders that hung from the side of the cars. He held out his hand to his brother. Sam pursed his lips as he huffed alongside the tracks. He took off the duffle bag and threw it at Dean.</p><p>“Come on, tough guy. You’re running like a seventy year old.”</p><p>Sam kicked his ass into high gear and thrust his hand toward Dean. His brother pulled him onto the steel grating between the two cars. Safely on the platform, Sam doubled over, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>“It’s hard to run in these pants,” he gasped.</p><p>“Sure it is Sammy.” Dean brushed the tunnel soot off Sam’s shoulders. “Let’s find Dad and Sis.”</p><p>Mary Anne Struthers couldn’t believe her eyes. She was sitting on her fire escape facing north, with the Hudson River and New Jersey to her right, trying to get cool in the midday heat. That was when she saw a group of people on the overpass of the tunnel above the train tracks. About twenty of them were standing there, some even looked like children. As the 4:40 train left Grand Central Station headed toward Albany, every single one of the people stepped off the bridge and disappeared below. Mary Anne wiped her brow, thinking she must have imagined it or it was some kind of mirage. But as the train pulled further north she saw the same people swarm down its sides and into the caboose. Strange, she thought. Then she shrugged.</p><p>She felt for the bottle of cold beer by her foot and continued to watch the world go by.</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean and Sam found Walter and Julia’s car. Julia opened the door, and Dean noticed she must have decided now was a good time to freshen up because she had styled her hair and put on a fresh blouse and skirt. The brothers squeezed into the sleeper cabin. It had two pull-down beds, one on each side of the roughly six foot-square space. Velvet jumper seats ran parallel on either side of the car. Walter was sitting down, studying the book that he and Sam had retrieved from the Bible Society.</p><p>“So what’s next, sports fans?” Dean said. “We just going to sit around here and do our summer reading list? ‘Cause I’m still trying to finish James and the Giant Peach.”</p><p>“Sit down. I’ve found a couple of citations that might relate to what I think is possessing James.” Walter looked at Dean and Sam over a pair of smudged reading glasses. “And yes, in lore they are very often found with Lilith. But not only Lilith, there are other demons which are identified with them as well.”</p><p>“Like who?”</p><p>“Like Satan’s wives, Eisheth and Agrat Bat-mahlat.”</p><p>“Wait, Satan’s wives?” Dean didn’t like the sound of that at all.</p><p>Sam blanched. “So we’re dealing with pre-biblical scrolls, which most likely have pre-biblical demons like Lilith protecting them? That could be a bloodbath.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Julia gripped her hands together.</p><p>“It means that everyone on this train could be in danger,” Sam explained. “It’s impossible to get everyone off. We’re going to have to demon-proof the entire train.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Okay, well, we can trap them or we can kill them with a knife—that we no longer have.”</p><p>“Can a demon jump from body to body? I don’t want to be possessed by a demon.” Julia’s voice caught in her throat as she continued, “If you guys spend so much time around demons how come you don’t get possessed?”</p><p>In unison, Sam and Dean loosened their ties and pulled at their collars, revealing their protection tattoos. Julia blushed as she looked at Dean’s.</p><p>“Oh. I see. Okay then. So what’s our next step?” she asked.</p><p>The boys formulated the plan. First they would need to get Eli into a safe place. Then they would have to set it up so that as James followed Eli, they could trap him in a Devil’s Trap. The unfortunate thing was James, the real James, was probably toast. The guard dog was having a field day, probably pissing all over everything. There was no way the man’s body was going to come out unscathed, especially after the gunshots and that fall he took. After that they were going to have to relieve Eli of the scrolls. And they had to do that carefully, because no one knew what else was lurking in the jars. Then there was Eli. They didn’t know anything about him. The safest thing now was to just assume he was human, he would bleed like everyone else.</p><p>“So what do we do first?” Julia asked.</p><p>“I think dinner,” Dean said with a smile.</p><p>“Really?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I reckon the dining car is going to be our best bet for the showdown—set up salt and Devil’s Traps. Later tonight, when it’s closed down, we draw Eli in there. James stays out, we rough up Eli, take his milk money and run.”</p><p>“I’ll stay here. There are still a hundred questions I have. I’ll order in.” Walter made himself comfortable.</p><p>“I’ll go.” Sam said.</p><p>“Why don’t you stay here with Walter. Or start marking up the other end of the train, away from us?” Dean motioned with his eyes toward Julia, who was paying no attention to him.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Fine.”</p><p>Dean grinned at Julia. “I guess it’s just you and me.”</p><p>She looked at him. “I think you need to wash your face first.” She motioned toward the small bathroom.</p><p>Dean opened the door and, looking in the mirror, noticed a large smudge of soot on his cheek. He rubbed it off with some spit and his fingers.</p><p>“Good as new. Let’s go sweetheart.” Dean opened up the cabin door. “Food’s on you, money bags.”</p><p>Sam handed Dean a half-dozen red wax pencils out of the duffel bag. “Mark as you go.”</p><p>Posing as a young couple in love, Julia took Dean’s arm as they negotiated the narrow hallways to the dining car. At each door leading to a new car, Julia would keep look out while Dean pulled up the carpet. On the bare floor he drew a Devil’s Trap, and then laid the carpet back over it.</p><p>“What about the windows?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Hopefully we’re only dealing with one. But if there are more demons coming, we’ll have to salt the windows and any other way they could get in.”</p><p>The dining car was functionally opulent, with white linen tablecloths, plush springy red-velvet seats and flowers in crystal bud vases on each table. A maîtred’ led them to a table. Dean pulled out Julia’s chair for her.</p><p>“I didn’t know you could be such a gentleman.”</p><p>“It’s a working dinner, sugar nips, don’t get any ideas.” Dean squinted at her. “Plus, there’s our guy now.”</p><p>Eli Thurman was reading a newspaper while shoveling beef bourguignon into his mouth. The case—presumably containing the scrolls—was placed firmly between his knees. Dean looked around, and noticed that on the other side of the door, at the far end of the car, James was pacing past the window, glancing in frequently to check on Eli.</p><p>“Wow, that guy is hardcore.”</p><p>“Hard what?”</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>“So can I ask you a question?” Julia smiled at Dean.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Who are you guys, really?”</p><p>Dean looked into Julia’s eyes. He instinctively knew better than to trust her. But something pulled at him from inside, he felt some sort of connection to her. He resisted.</p><p>“I’ll lay it out straight. We are exterminators of a sort. And I am in the family business. But what I do and how I do it, it’s best if you don’t know.”</p><p>“But you know about demons, inscriptions within ancient pre-biblical urns. You mentioned a knife that can kill demons. And it’s not the first time you’ve run into whatever almost killed my father,” Julia said carefully. “It seems to me that there is much more to you than meets the eye.”</p><p>“There’s always much more than meets the eye—but we haven’t known each other for that long,” Dean said with a wink.</p><p>“So, my life is in your hands and I’m just going to have to trust you?”</p><p>“Basically.” Dean looked down at the menu. “No burger?”</p><p>“I’m serious. I want to know who you are.”</p><p>Dean closed his menu in a huff.</p><p>“Okay, listen lady, I know you’ve been playing it pretty cool up till now, but I don’t trust you or your dad. I don’t know what your bag is and I don’t want to know. But in my experience a gun-toting pretty face only leads to one thing. Trouble. So I’m steering clear of you. We’re here to get the scroll and get back home. We can pretend this is all for one and one for all musketeers crap, but when the time comes I’m going to do my job, just make sure you do yours.”</p><p>Julia didn’t blink, she didn’t even blush.</p><p>“You think I’m pretty?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam took a couple of wax pencils and decided to start from the back of the train. As people slept in their seats in the economy cars, Sam quietly moved through, marking all the doors with Devil’s Traps. He had to move quickly, Devil’s Traps took a while to draw and it was a long train.</p><p>Sam finally reached the storage cars, and made his way to the caboose. On the ceiling as well as on the floor, he carefully drew a Devil’s Trap. His back was to the door when a man in a uniform opened it and stepped in.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing in here?”</p><p>Sam spun around. “Oh sorry, I was trying to find my bag. I forgot to bring my shaving kit to my cabin.”</p><p>“Well, let me help. You take that side, I’ll look on this side,” the guy said as he waddled toward Sam. “What’s the name on the suitcase?”</p><p>“Ahh, George. George Michael.”</p><p>“What do you do George?”</p><p>Sam tried to seem anxious about finding his suitcase.</p><p>“Oh, you know.” Sam was drawing a blank. “I’m a song and dance man.”</p><p>“Really? Because I would have said you were a liar!”</p><p>The uniformed man dived at Sam just as he ducked and rolled out of his way, knocking a pile of steamer trunks over. The man’s eyes flashed black as he flung himself over the trunks. Sam didn’t have a weapon—he had stupidly left the salt-packed shotguns in Walter and Julia’s cabin—and he doubted that there was any salt hanging around the storage car. Sam kicked the demon in the face, then swung at him with a heavy-handled suitcase. The large man fell face first, giving Sam an opportunity to move toward the door, past the Devil’s Traps.</p><p>The guy leapt to his feet with surprising grace, and threw himself at Sam, landing rather nicely in the middle of the hastily drawn symbol on the floor.</p><p>“Get me out of here,” he growled.</p><p>“Sorry, guy. You need to answer some questions first.”</p><p>“Go to Hell.”</p><p>“Really, that’s all you got? How many more of you are there?”</p><p>“You’ll never possess the scroll. It doesn’t belong to you.”</p><p>“What do you know about it?”</p><p>With that the demon took out a pistol.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Sam lunged at him, but the demon put the barrel to his head and pulled the trigger. Sam lay on top of the brain and blood spattered corpse. Black smoke screamed out of his mouth, and gathered as a dark cloud on the ceiling. With a whoosh it flew out an air vent.</p><p>Crushed and frustrated, Sam pulled himself up and retreated back to the cabin.</p><p>Walter was finishing a ham sandwich.</p><p>“Good lord, what happened to you?”</p><p>“Guy, or demon rather, just blew a man’s brains out. Where’s Dean and Julia?”</p><p>“Still eating.”</p><p>“We have to tell them. Let’s go. Grab your books too.”</p><p>Walter hurriedly picked up his jacket. Sam grabbed his duffle bag and handed Walter a shotgun.</p><p>“Do you know how to use one of these things?”</p><p>“Of course. I fought in both wars.”</p><p>Sam had forgotten that this was an era where generations of people had lived through two world wars. It seemed strange to think that the third war would be Armageddon itself.</p><p>Sam and Walter made their way to the dining car.</p><p>Eli dabbed at the corners of his mouth and set the napkin onto his plate. He then grabbed for the case that housed the scrolls.</p><p>Dean looked at Julia. “You’re on.”</p><p>Julia glanced at Eli, and drained her martini glass. She approached Eli’s table.</p><p>“May I join you?”</p><p>Eli didn’t look up as he pushed out his chair. “I’m sorry, I’m leav—“ His eyes met Julia’s large baby blues.</p><p>“Oh please, do have one drink with me. It’s so dull traveling alone. Don’t you think?”</p><p>“I thought you were with that fellow over there?” Eli looked up, but Dean was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Oh that plebian, not at all. He invited himself to sit with me. All the while, I was hoping to join you for dinner.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>It was clear that Eli did not remember Julia. The refined woman wearing a blouse and a nice-fitting red suit looked quite different from the gun-toting, jeans-wearing, 1950s Lara Croft who had stormed the Waldorf’s Presidential Suite.</p><p>As Julia continued to chat up Eli, Dean met Sam and Walter in the hallway in the next car.</p><p>“Another demon,” Sam reported.</p><p>“Damnit. From where?”</p><p>“I don’t know. The one in the caboose was a security guard. Strange thing was his uniform said he was from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.”</p><p>“Let’s get everyone out of the dining car and get this freaking scroll from Howdy Doody. ‘Cause I want to get back home,” Dean said.</p><p>Julia was still talking to Eli when the boys and Walter walked into the dining car. Even though Eli was only giving one-word answers to Julia’s questions, he was clearly enthralled. Walter sat at the table right behind Eli.</p><p>Sam quietly ushered the other diners out of the car. After flashing a police badge, he said he was train security and there had been a series of thefts. Everyone was asked to go back to their cabins and seats and check all their belongings.</p><p>Dean asked all the waiters, most of whom were African-American, to go back to the kitchen car. This was official train business, he explained, and they needed to use the dining car.</p><p>None of them moved. “What kind of official train business? We weren’t told of anything,” a lithe black guy said to Dean, “and they always tell us if it has to do with service.”</p><p>Dean noticed that James had disappeared from the doorway. That’s not good, he thought. He turned to the waiter.</p><p>“Can you get me all the salt you have in the kitchen?”</p><p>“Salt? Sir, I’m truly sorry, but I can’t—“</p><p>“Listen, dude, I get it, you’re just trying to keep your job. But right now there is a distinct possibility that a whole host of very ancient and pissed off demons are on this train. And I need that salt.”</p><p>“Demons? Why didn’t you say?” The guy pulled a small green cloth bag out from the collar of his shirt. “Chicken bones, feather, little dust. Demons don’t scare me none.”</p><p>“Hoodoo?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Born and raised and taught by my momma.”</p><p>“Great. Then please get me all the salt you have, and start making lines at the doors and windows.”</p><p>“You got it. Name’s Ray.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you. Dean.” Dean shook Ray’s outstretched hand. A couple of other guys followed Ray out of the dining car to the kitchen.</p><p>Julia looked down at her watch. “Well, look at the time. We really do need to retire. We reach Chicago quite early tomorrow, don’t we?”</p><p>Eli noticed the car was now empty of diners, save for two big guys and the old man seated behind him. Finally, he took a good look at Sam. Recognition dawned on his face. Eli got up and moved to pick up his case.</p><p>“I’ll take that,” Walter said, pulling the case from underneath Eli’s chair.</p><p>“That’s mine. You can’t have it. I remember you—you were at the auction too.” Eli looked around the room. “You all were.”</p><p>Dean trained a shotgun on Eli.</p><p>“Yes, and you took something that we need.”</p><p>Walter backed up behind Sam and Dean as Julia stepped away. Eli visibly started to panic.</p><p>“You don’t understand—I need those.”</p><p>“Yeah, buddy, so do we. Sort of like the entire planet hangs in the balance.”</p><p>An enormous crash echoed from the dining car ceiling.</p><p>“What was that?” Eli shrieked. Small flakes of paint floated down from the gilded ceiling.</p><p>“They’re on the roof,” Sam cried. “Walter, Julia, make these signs everywhere!” Sam threw them wax pencils.</p><p>“You,” Dean indicated Eli. “Stay where you are.”</p><p>Eli shuddered as he watched Walter attempt to open the locked case. A series of bumps and thumps emanated from above.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Eli demanded, sounding scared.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what’s going on,” Dean snapped. “The contents of your little suitcase there comes with a whole mess of angry demons that are bound to protect it. During your Thomas Crown moment they were released, and now they’re after whomever has the scrolls. So bite it, buddy. Right now we’re saving your sorry ass.”</p><p>Dean hastily drew a Devil’s Trap on the ceiling, then another right next to it.</p><p>Ray and the other waiters returned from the kitchen car.</p><p>“Hey man,” Ray said warily, “I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but it’s looking bad out there. Like a damn demon hoe-down.”</p><p>“Just my type of gig.” Dean handed Ray a wax pencil. “Don’t need to be da Vinci.”</p><p>The banging sound from above stopped.</p><p>“Where’d they go?” Julia asked, peeking out of the window.</p><p>“They’re trying to find another way in,” Dean said.</p><p>“Will they?” she asked.</p><p>“Hopefully not, but if you see one, use this.” Dean handed her a shotgun filled with salt shells. “I have a feeling you can handle it.”</p><p>Dean then grabbed his brother and they moved to a corner to confer.</p><p>“So what’s the plan?” Sam asked.</p><p>“They’re here for the scrolls right? But we don’t know which one—are they protecting all of them, or only one?”</p><p>“I would guess that if Lilith has anything to do with the demon possessing James, then it has to be our scroll. The War Scroll. If you were Lucifer, wouldn’t you want to protect the battle plan to defeat you?”</p><p>“Right, but... musty old ancient bitch demon, how does she know what we give her?”</p><p>Sam and Dean set about tearing up linen tablecloths.</p><p>“Hey Ray, are there any canisters in the kitchen, like for flour or something?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Absolutely. But I don’t think I want to go out there.” Ray motioned toward the door scrawled with the Devil’s Trap. “They sound like some bad-ass demons.”</p><p>“I’ll go with you.”</p><p>Dean grabbed the shotgun back from Julia.</p><p>“You know, you could have brought along your own firearm, if you’re so women’s lib.”</p><p>“What?” Julia asked, puzzled by the modern reference.</p><p>Dean aimed the shotgun at the sky as Ray opened the door and they crossed the rattling platform to the kitchen car.</p><p>Dean kicked open the door, the stainless steel glinted from the fluorescent lights. He stepped in further.</p><p>Ray gasped. The chef, a pudgy man with floppy ears, was splayed out on the floor, his heart split in two by a meat cleaver. The sous-chef had fallen at his side, with a soup ladle impaled through his eye.</p><p>“Bernie and Ralph didn’t deserve that,” Ray muttered.</p><p>“Let’s get that flour.” Dean stepped over the bodies to the baking area. He grabbed four steel flour canisters and handed them to Ray.</p><p>“Well, well,” a voice said. “I was hoping to meet the son of the mother slain, the vessel of goodness and light.”</p><p>Dean spun around to face a young girl in a Waldorf Astoria maid’s uniform. With her blouse half-unbuttoned, her skirt cinched up, and her lips blood-red, she was clearly a full-on, fully sexed-up demoness.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?” Dean’s shotgun was aimed right at her heart.</p><p>“Exactly. I do love scholars. I’m Eisheth, sister to Lilith.”</p><p>“Lilith has family?”</p><p>“Sister by marriage. I’m one of Lucifer’s wives and so is she.”</p><p>“So you’re like Mormon demons? Kinky.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes flashed red.</p><p>“I wouldn’t make it mad,” Ray whispered.</p><p>Dean moved toward Eisheth. “Well, listen, this was really fun and all, but we better be getting back.” He trained the gun on the demoness and stepped toward her, Ray close behind him. “Just a little warning, the salt in here is going to burn a lot, like a bad herpes outbreak. They have that back where you’re from?”</p><p>“You remind me of the town leper,” Eisheth growled.</p><p>“Yeah, I get that a lot.”</p><p>They circled one another until Dean and Ray could back-peddle out of the kitchen toward the dining car.</p><p>Ray opened the door and backed out first.</p><p>There was a low growl. Dean turned his head to see James perched above them on the scaffolding between the train cars. Before Dean could get off a shot, James jumped at Ray.</p><p>Ray hit the deck of the car and almost rolled off. Dean shot James in the shoulder, making the animal even madder. He turned and lunged at Dean.</p><p>From inside the dining car Sam had his shotgun trained on the back of James’s head. Dean gave a nod and ducked as Sam took the shot. The window shattered.</p><p>James’s body fell forward, lifeless. The demon inside shot up into the air and out of sight.</p><p>Dean spun around just in time to catch Eisheth dragging Ray back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Leave him alone, he didn’t do anything. We’re the ones with the scrolls.”</p><p>“I’ve always liked a proper sacrifice,” Eisheth hissed. She produced a long blade, picked Ray up by the neck and in one swift movement sliced him from groin to throat.</p><p>“No!” Dean got off another shot as Eisheth flung Ray aside and raced toward him.</p><p>Dean dived back into the dining car. Two of the waiters pushed a wooden table up against the door’s broken window. Eisheth pounded on the other side of the barrier.</p><p>Dean pushed his back against the wall—that wasn’t a fair way for Ray to go.</p><p>“I found out who we’re dealing with,” he said.</p><p>“Who?” Julia came forward.</p><p>Eli sat quivering in a corner.</p><p>“Bitch named Eisheth. Know anything about her, doc?” Dean looked at Walter.</p><p>“Yes, she’s one of Satan’s wives. She doesn’t come up very much.”</p><p>“Yeah, because she’s playing second fiddle to Lilith.”</p><p>Sam looked to see if Eli had any inkling as to what they were talking about. From the look on his face, it seemed like he did.</p><p>Sam leaned over Eli. “What do you know about the scrolls?” he shouted into the little guy’s face. “You’re not telling us something. Why did you want them so badly?”</p><p>Eli scrambled to the other side of a table.</p><p>“They’re precious. You wouldn’t understand. The scrolls were written by the Essenes, devout followers of Judaism. They are pre-biblical.”</p><p>“Tell us something we don’t know.”</p><p>Just then, the train lurched. Everyone fell forward.</p><p>“What is that bitch doing now?” Dean got up and pushed his head out of the window. Eisheth was underneath the train. Sparks flew as a piece of the undercarriage rolled down the incline of the train tracks.</p><p>“Hope we didn’t need that.” Dean trained his shotgun at Eisheth. The shots went wide.</p><p>“So now what do we do?” Walter had spread the War Scroll over a couple of tables.</p><p>“You put that in here.” Dean threw him the metal container.</p><p>“But this isn’t sterile. This is centuries-old parchment, it can’t be exposed to foreign substances.”</p><p>“Well it’s a foreign scroll in a foreign land. Put it in there.”</p><p>Walter gently wrapped the scroll in a tablecloth and put it in the canister.</p><p>“Now give it to Sam.”</p><p>“You don’t understand—“ Walter faltered.</p><p>“Old man, do you want to get out of here alive or not? Give it to Sam!”</p><p>Sam took the canister and placed it in the duffle bag that hung from his shoulder.</p><p>“Julia, take the scroll jar and stuff it with strips of tablecloth. We’re going to make a little ancient trade. Who wants to play bargain with a demoness?”</p><p>No one raised their hands.</p><p>“Okay then, guess I have to have a little tête-à-tête with this bitch myself. Sam?” Dean beckoned to his brother.</p><p>They huddled together. It was a bad situation and the fact that they were on a moving train just added to their problems.</p><p>“This is what I figure,” Dean said. “We need to get the passengers away from her. And we need to get away from her. I say we play a little Great Train Robbery and detach the cars.”</p><p>“What about Eli?”</p><p>“We have the scroll, right? Just let him go.”</p><p>Five minutes later, Sam had scaled the train through the back door of the dining car. The roof of the car was rain slicked, and a wind blew off the Great Lakes on his left. He made his way over the top of the dining car toward the bar. Sam had to move quickly in order to get over to the passenger car and detach it from the train.</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean cocked his shotgun as he stepped out of the dining car. Julia followed him holding the jar containing the pieces of tablecloth. She salted the door behind her and went after Dean.</p><p>“Hey second string!” Dean called into the night air. He and Julia stepped into the next car. A long wooden bar extended down one side.</p><p>“Wow, swanky. Hey Lilith’s handmaid, where you at?”</p><p>Eisheth appeared between them and the dining car. Great. Now Dean was going to have to make a deal with Eisheth and get around her before Sam detached the car from the train.</p><p>Two more demons popped up from behind the bar.</p><p>“Drink?” Dean asked as he moved toward them.</p><p>“Who is she?” Eisheth pointed at Julia.</p><p>“My little sister. She comes with me everywhere. Always tagging along. Sort of like you and Lilith.”</p><p>“That whore? I was shut away for thousands of years while she got to play out in the world.”</p><p>“Oh come on, she’s family, you gotta love your sister. Well, maybe not. I mean she did get to shack up with Lucifer way more often than you did. Do you think they have a china pattern?”</p><p>“Retribution comes to those who wait.”</p><p>“I think it’s ‘good things,’ but whatever. So Eisheth, how about we make a deal? I give you the scroll, and you go on your merry way. And while you’re at it, you can let these poor people who your friends are knocking around in go. They can just jump out of them and leave them in peace.”</p><p>“War doesn’t leave anyone unscathed.”</p><p>“Semantics, Eisheth. About the scroll.”</p><p>“Is that it?”</p><p>Julia placed the ancient jar on the bar.</p><p>A possessed bartender reached for it, black eyes flashing.</p><p>“Leave it!” Eisheth eyed the guy. “It’s not yours to defile. It’s my responsibility.”</p><p>“So this is all about responsibility? Fantastic. I admire that in a demon. You take your job seriously. I get it. Now we’re just going to scoot on out of here.”</p><p>“Wait! I want to see it,” Eisheth hissed.</p><p>Dean hoped that Sam was just about done playing model train because things were getting bad down here.</p><p>Sam was in fact hanging onto the side of the train, in between the bar car and the passenger car. He was struggling with the hitching mechanism when he realized the steel levers that hooked the train cars together required a key. He scaled the ladder once again.</p><p>Sam sprinted across the tops of the cars. He looked into the distance. It was dark, no lights—he couldn’t see anything speeding toward him as he ran. One tree branch or tunnel would do him in. Could he die in the past? He was pretty sure he could.</p><p>Sam jumped down to the platform of the engine. He tried the door, but the lever wouldn’t budge. Sam banged on the door until the engineer emerged out of the darkness. He was a tall guy in striped overalls. Just like you would expect. Sam motioned for him to let him in.</p><p>“Who are you?” the engineer asked as he pushed open the door a crack.</p><p>Sam played dumb. “I seem to have lost my way.”</p><p>In a flash, he shoved himself through the opening and gave the engineer a smack to the nose with his elbow. The man fell to the ground.</p><p>“Where’s your hitching key?” Sam demanded.</p><p>The prone engineer pointed to a long steel rod hanging on the wall.</p><p>“When you feel the train get lighter you push this thing full throttle, okay?” The man nodded.</p><p>Sam leapt out of the car and scaled the ladder once again.</p><p>Dean heard Sam run across the roof for the second time in five minutes. He must be close.</p><p>“Why do you want to see it?” Dean challenged. “What’s on it that’s so important.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes flashed red again.</p><p>“You know what I think?” Dean continued. “I think you’re torn, because you promised your husband that you would protect this thing for him. But at the same time you know what it says. It’s how to kill him, isn’t it?”</p><p>Dean saw Julia glance at him out of the corner of his eye. Her look said, Surely this isn’t the best way to negotiate with a demon?</p><p>Ignoring her, Dean carried on goading Eisheth.</p><p>“You know what else I think? I think that you’re pissed Lucifer gave you the babysitting job, and now you just might want to read that little battle plan for yourself. You know, take your husband’s job, sort of like a senate seat.”</p><p>Eisheth lunged at Dean. He knocked her back with the butt of his shotgun.</p><p>“No touching.”</p><p>Eisheth lunged at him again, just as the train sped up dramatically. Through the window he could see the passenger part of the train start to pull away. The split-second distraction enabled Dean to push Julia toward the dining car.</p><p>Eisheth spun around and attacked Dean. He fell to the ground, face first. The shotgun skittered away from his reach.</p><p>Julia darted forward and picked it up, blasting Eisheth in the shoulder and knocking her off Dean. The two bartenders came after Julia, but in a surprising move she coupled a round-house kick with a flash of a blade.</p><p>The gashes to the demons’ bodies flared orange and they dropped to the ground. Ruby’s knife!</p><p>“What the —! Julia run!” Dean screamed as he rolled over and kicked Eisheth in the chest, sending her flying across the bar.</p><p>Dean turned toward the door. Sam was waving urgently. He was now in the process of unhitching the bar car.</p><p>Dean leapt to his feet and got halfway out onto the platform, but Eisheth was close behind. She grabbed him and pulled him to the ground in the doorway. Below him, Dean could see the levers clicking as the car struggled to detach. Sam was pushing heavily on the lever.</p><p>“Time to go, Dean.”</p><p>Eisheth got her hands around Dean’s throat. He struggled to breathe.</p><p>“Wow, 3,000 years in a jar hasn’t done anything for your dental hygiene,” he croaked.</p><p>Dean managed to get his knees up and reverse donkey-kick Eisheth back into the bar car.</p><p>“Now!” Sam screamed.</p><p>Julia opened fire on Eisheth. The salt bullets penetrated her body, each shot pushing her further back into the bar car.</p><p>Dean rolled backward into the dining car just as the bar car split off. The rest of the train hurtled down the tracks.</p><p>Eisheth was left standing in the bar car, cursing.</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The bar car plummeted into the darkness of the night. Sam and Dean shut the door behind them. They had gotten rid of Eisheth for now, but she would be after them as soon as she realized that the scroll had been switched.</p><p>Inside the dining car, Julia tried to avoid Dean’s gaze. He walked up to her and roughly grabbed her arm.</p><p>“What the hell was that?” he demanded.</p><p>“Get your hands off her!” Walter protested.</p><p>“Wait your turn, old man, you’re in on this too. You have our knife! Do you know how useful that could have been the last couple of days? We’re fighting demons, and it’s the only thing that kills them. Hello, fighting demons.” Dean motioned to the carnage around him. “Not to mention the fact that you did steal it from us. Do you have anything to say for yourself?”</p><p>Julia looked up at Dean. “I’m sorry. We needed to find out who you were. And I took it. I didn’t know what it was for, until today.”</p><p>“Which begs the question: Who are you?” Dean stood beside Sam glaring at Walter and Julia.</p><p>Walter stepped forward. “We’re hunters. Just like you.”</p><p>“And you were going to tell us this when?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Doesn’t anyone care that there were demons on this train!” Eli wailed in panic from his corner.</p><p>Dean, Sam, Julia, and Walter turned toward him in unison and shouted, “SHUT UP!”</p><p>Julia tried to speak soothingly to Dean. “I know you feel betrayed, but we were trying to protect ourselves just as much as you were. I didn’t steal it in order to put you at a disadvantage.”</p><p>“You sure about that?” Dean spat.</p><p>“Here.” Julia held out the knife. “I know I can’t make up for it.” She pulled out Sam’s BlackBerry and held it gingerly. “I took this as well, but I don’t know what it’s for.”</p><p>Sam grabbed it from her, and concealed it inside his jacket.</p><p>“You have a lot of explaining to do, young lady,” Dean said.</p><p>“Right, well, maybe,” Walter conceded reluctantly, “but right now we need to get as much track in between us and that demon as possible.”</p><p>Dean scowled at Julia. Besides his hunter instincts, which told him never to trust her again, Dean felt a knot of discomfort in his stomach. His feelings were hurt.</p><p>Dean sublimated his anger and hurt while they looked at the rail line map of the Water Level Route. It ran from New York City to Albany along the Great Lakes to Chicago. They were just about at Albany.</p><p>“We need to get a move on,” Dean said as he grabbed a shotgun and headed for the engine car.</p><p>Sam and Dean made their way over the platform between the cars.</p><p>“Go easy on the guy, I already clocked him once,” Sam said as he knocked on the car’s door. No answer. Dean took the butt of the shotgun and slammed it against the wood.</p><p>The engineer immediately opened the door.</p><p>“Okay, okay.” He backed up from the doorway with his hands up. “I haven’t done nothin’. I’m driving her as fast as I can.”</p><p>“And you’re going to keep driving it all the way through Albany. Don’t stop until we’re outside of Chicago. You got that?”</p><p>“I’ll have to call ahead and get them to change the tracks. What do I tell them?” the engineer stuttered.</p><p>“Tell them Eisenhower is on board. Top secret mission and there’s no stopping,” Dean said.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Wow, okay. Yes sir. Right outside Chicago it is.”</p><p>Dean nodded and they headed back to the dining car.</p><p>“Do you have the feeling that people really are more innocent in the fifties?” Dean asked.</p><p>Everyone in the dining car looked a little the worse for wear. Julia sat with her legs up on a chair. Dean immediately noticed their slender shape, and the way her ankles tapered down to her feet. Walter mumbled to himself while sat at a table. Eli was a mess. But the waiters seemed to have taken everything, even the gruesome death of one of their own, in their stride.</p><p>“Everyone get some rest. We’re skipping Albany and going straight for Chicago. Good burger town,” Dean announced.</p><p>Everyone grabbed extra tablecloths and lay down on the floor or on tables pushed together. They had over 500 miles to sleep through.</p><p>Dean and Sam sat in the corner holding shotguns while everyone else slept.</p><p>“I don’t trust them,” Dean said quietly. “Even if they are hunters. Where do they get off stealing things like that?”</p><p>Sam shot Dean a look. Was he whining?</p><p>“We always steal things.”</p><p>“I know, but we need them. And, like, I would never steal from another hunter.”</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s not like we know hundreds of other hunters, either.”</p><p>“Whose side are you on?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“I’m on your side, Dean. Why are you PMSing?”</p><p>“I’m not PMSing. You are.”</p><p>Sam thought it best to change the subject. “So what do you want to do?”</p><p>Dean peered at Walter and Julia’s sleeping figures in the darkness.</p><p>“We have the scroll. First light we get the hell out of here.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. They would find a way to translate the last pages of the scroll somehow. If not, they could always have Abbandon do it for them. He was the one that had told them all about the scroll in the first place, so surely he could read it.</p><p>Sam watched as lights from tiny towns flickered across the dining car’s blood-red rug. For a moment, in all this craziness, he missed Ruby. It was an awful thing to feel, since she had betrayed Sam into thinking she was on their side. She had fed him her own blood, which made Sam incomprehensibly more powerful than he ever thought was possible for a human being. But, then again, he wasn’t really a human being in some senses. Would a human being drink demon blood? Sam doubted it.</p><p>“What do you think is on the scroll?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. Hopefully a step-by-step recipe, like a brownie mix. Something that tells us what Lucifer’s weaknesses are. There has to be another way.”</p><p>Sam hoped that was true.</p><p>At first light the train was on the edges of Gary, Indiana. The morning was grey, low clouds hung over the lake, threatening summer thunderstorms. Dean woke up first, nudged Sam, and they got to their feet quietly. In the half-light Dean could see Julia and Walter covered with tablecloths, still sleeping.</p><p>Dean and Sam crept out of the dining car. Sam had the scroll secure in the duffle bag hung over his shoulder. Up ahead, the train tracks took a lazy swing to the left—the train would slow enough for the brothers to leap off. They climbed down the ladder on the side of the kitchen car and waited as the train slowed. Sam took the first jump. He rolled down a six-foot incline into a soft green field. Dean then jumped after him. He hit the incline at the wrong angle and tumbled ass over elbows to the bottom.</p><p>“I miss my Impala,” he said, dusting his suit off.</p><p>The train disappeared into the distance. Julia, Walter, and Eli would all find their way. The most important thing was they had the scroll. Now all they had to do was find a way home—back to 2010.</p><p>The boys walked alongside the train tracks. In front of them the town of Gary was beginning to come to life. Small trails of smoke rose from the stacks looming above the steel mills.</p><p>“You know who grew up in Gary?” Dean said.</p><p>“Who?” Sam asked, looking at his brother—he had a feeling this was going to be bad.</p><p>It was. Dean did his best moonwalk, crotch pull and fake head dip.</p><p>“Michael Jackson.”</p><p>“Highly disturbing, Dean.” Sam increased his pace.</p><p>They reached a dirt road that headed west.</p><p>“You’re no fun,” Dean said. “Let’s get to town, get a car and figure out where the hell we’re going.”</p><p>They climbed up a small incline to the road.</p><p>“Nice morning,” a voice called breezily.</p><p>Both brothers swung around. Standing on the other side of the road were Walter and Julia. Julia walked with a sexy swagger toward Dean.</p><p>“Shame on you for not waking us first. We wouldn’t want you to leave without saying goodbye.” She gave him a push and her tone switched from playful to angry. “Who the hell do you think you are?”</p><p>Dean and Sam exchanged looks. Loaded question.</p><p>“That scroll is just as much ours as it is yours. You’re not taking it from us.”</p><p>“Listen lady,” Dean said, “I get it, you’re tough. But we’ve come a long way for this scroll. A lot further than you have. So you and Daddy Warbucks just go on back to New York. We have stuff to do.”</p><p>Sam and Dean continued to walk toward town. Julia raced to keep up with them, while Walter struggled with his bad leg.</p><p>“I didn’t risk my behind so you could take it from us,” Julia cried.</p><p>“Your behind?” Dean smirked. “That’s exhibit A that you’re over your head.”</p><p>He and Sam continued walking.</p><p>“Take one more step and I blow your balls off.”</p><p>They paused, and turned around slowly. Julia was aiming a pistol at them.</p><p>“This isn’t full of rock salt either.”</p><p>“Aww, man,” Dean whined, “are you really going to do this? Where’d you get that?”</p><p>“It’s the engineer’s. Now let’s all get to town and have a nice long talk, shall we?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The ragtag group walked in silence. Dean was clearly pissed. Sam was trying to figure out if there was any other way to get Walter to translate the last pages of the scroll.</p><p>Julia glared at the nape of Dean’s neck.</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>“You’re burning a hole in my head, sweet-stuff. Look somewhere else.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a look of distaste.</p><p>On the outskirts of Gary they spotted a lone diner on a corner. It was oblong, all glass windows and steel. The rest of the area was basically empty gravel lots.</p><p>They headed for the diner. Inside, a Formica countertop ran the length of the narrow restaurant. Each table had an individual jukebox and a window view. Sam could see two waitresses, both of whom wore yellow dresses with frilly white aprons.</p><p>Three steel workers made a rowdy group, cracking jokes at a corner table. Clearly they had just come off the night shift at one of the mills.</p><p>Walter and Julia slid onto the benches at one of the tables, while Sam and Dean headed for the men’s room.</p><p>“I’ve had enough of the goon suits. Now that we’re back in the real America, I’m putting my jeans on,” Dean said as he unbuttoned.</p><p>“Good thinkin’ Palin,” Sam said as he too began to undress.</p><p>Walter and Julia were speaking in hushed tones when Dean and Sam reappeared. They broke off as the brothers approached. Four cups of coffee steamed in front of them. Dean sat down next to Julia and leaned across her, essentially putting his armpit in her face.</p><p>“Excuse me, got to get the sugar.” Dean grabbed at the sugar shaker. Julia bristled.</p><p>“Okay. First things first,” Walter said, “you don’t leave without us. We all worked to get the scroll. None of us can lay claim over the others.”</p><p>Dean huffed. “Walter, we came a long way for this—“</p><p>“So did we,” Julia insisted.</p><p>Just then a heavy-set woman with a large beehive hairdo sashayed up. She slid menus onto the table.</p><p>“Hi there. I’m Marge. I own this place. Let me know if you need anyth—“</p><p>She trailed off as her eye lit on something outside the diner. Dean followed her gaze out of the window and clocked the deserted lot across the street. Picking their way over the gravel were Eisheth and her cronies, among them several people in Metropolitan Museum of Art uniforms.</p><p>“Incoming,” Dean said quietly. He got up and pulled a shotgun from Sam’s duffel bag.</p><p>“Young man, shotguns are not allowed in my restaurant,” Marge chided.</p><p>“Listen Marge,” Dean said firmly, “out there is a group of very dangerous people. So I apologize if your place gets a little messy.”</p><p>The steel workers in the corner got up to leave.</p><p>“I wouldn’t go out there if I were you,” Dean warned them, glancing over his shoulder. He had the shotgun trained on Eisheth.</p><p>“Buddy, what the hell you doing with that rifle?” one of the steel workers demanded.</p><p>“Believe me, it’s safer in here,” Dean said.</p><p>Julia pushed Walter toward the kitchen. “Dad, get the salt.”</p><p>A waitress walked out with a couple of plates of eggs. Catching sight of the shotgun, she promptly spun on her heel and headed back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Barricade any doors in the back too,” Dean called after Walter.</p><p>Ignoring Dean’s warning, the steel workers walked out of the door onto the sidewalk. Not two seconds later they were attacked by Eisheth’s group.</p><p>A little girl in a Catholic school uniform approached the first steel worker. She kneed him in the groin. When he stumbled and fell to the ground, she smiled sweetly, then slit his throat with a jagged rock.</p><p>The other two men tried to run. A uniformed Met worker shot out his hand and grabbed one of them by the throat. The demon’s strength meant the guy was choked to death in seconds. The third man managed to escape.</p><p>Eisheth stood on the sidewalk, looking up at Sam and Dean. The thin strip of macadam that served as the parking lot was the only thing that separated them from her. That and the salt that Walter and Julia were spreading on the window sills.</p><p>“Game plan?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean stared out at the waiting group of demons.</p><p>“We can stand and fight or make a run for it. Either option is probably a death wish. Though not for you — they’ll keep you alive.”</p><p>Sam looked solemn. He knew it was true. The demons wouldn’t hurt a hair on his head. For the rest of them, however, it was a different story.</p><p>Eisheth made the first move, but was thwarted by the Devil’s Trap Julia had hastily drawn in front of the glass doors.</p><p>“Aww, why don’t you come out and play Sammy?” she called plaintively. “I mean, we’re practically family. I never thought I would get to meet you—my husband’s favorite vessel.”</p><p>Julia looked at Sam with suspicion. “What does she mean by that?”</p><p>“Why, you don’t know? Sammy here has been chosen—“</p><p>Dean blasted Eisheth with a salt shotgun, sending her sailing through the air. She landed on her back, but it didn’t seem to faze her one bit.</p><p>“You can’t stay in there forever,” she said levelly.</p><p>She gave a signal and the demons attacked. The first wave came from a handful of demons crawling up onto the roof.</p><p>“Can they get through that?” Walter asked.</p><p>The creaking sound of ripping metal from above signified that indeed the demons could.</p><p>“What the hell is going on—they better not be taking off my roof!” Marge went behind the counter and pulled out her own shotgun. She let a couple of rounds loose at the ceiling, right below where the demons were trying to break in. “Damn, I just put a hole in my own roof.”</p><p>The first demon that dropped down into the diner was a woman of about Julia’s age. Her eyes flashed black as she sped toward Walter. Julia drop-kicked her, then tried to shoot her with her pistol. But the demon was too fast. She knocked Julia’s pistol away, and pounced on her. Julia twisted, grabbed the demon’s neck, and with a mighty kick threw her over her head.</p><p>The demon landed flat on her back. Julia crawled over to her pistol just as the demon attacked again. Julia turned and shot the woman. Black smoke poured out of her mouth and her body crumpled to the ground.</p><p>“Watch out!” Dean called to her. He spun and started unloading more rock salt bullets at the ceiling as another two demons dropped down onto the counter top. One kicked over the metal cake stand that displayed a cherry pie.</p><p>“Hey man, show some respect to the pies,” Dean shouted.</p><p>He shot the guy in the shoulder. Black smoke shot up and out of his mouth, disappearing into an air vent.</p><p>Outside, the rest of the demons looked like they were itching to join the fight.</p><p>Julia spun and drop-kicked another demon.</p><p>“How are we going to get out of here?” she cried.</p><p>They all heard the rumble at the same time. The cab of a large diesel eighteen-wheeler was barreling over the gravel lot toward the diner. Five demons were dispatched as the grill of the truck ran them over.</p><p>“Get out of the way!” Dean yelled.</p><p>The truck cab hit the front part of the diner. It tore open like tin foil. Inside the cab was the third steel worker.</p><p>“I know trouble when I see it. Get in!” he called.</p><p>Sam continued to shoot at Eisheth.</p><p>“Not the last you’ve seen of me, baby doll,” Eisheth purred.</p><p>Walter, Julia, Sam, and Dean scrambled onto the front of the cab.</p><p>“Not so fast.” Marge shot out her hand and grabbed Walter’s foot. Her eyes flashed black. “Someone needs to stay here and help me clean up this mess.”</p><p>Walter struggled to hold on to the truck’s hood.</p><p>The steel worker looked at his side mirror.</p><p>“We gotta roll. More are comin’ our way.”</p><p>Marge slashed and pulled on Walter’s ankle as Julia tugged at her father’s wrists. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean kept Eisheth and the others at bay.</p><p>“Dean, help!” Julia cried.</p><p>Dean twisted and shot Marge between the eyes. She rolled off the front of the cab and dropped to the ground. Black smoke poured out of her mouth.</p><p>“Go, go, go!” Sam shouted.</p><p>The driver punched the cab into reverse and swung wide, running over a couple more demons. As they perched on each side of the cab, Sam and Dean shot at the demons. The truck barreled off. Julia pulled her father into the cab.</p><p>“Thank you so much!” Julia exclaimed, wiping the sweat from her brow.</p><p>“My pleasure.” The steel worked introduced himself. “Name’s Mike. It looked like you needed some help. Once I saw what those things did to Benny and Jim, I knew I had to do something. I just gotta return this cab to the mill by nighttime.”</p><p>“No problem. Can you take us past Chicago?” Dean called.</p><p>The truck sped down the streets of Gary and then swung onto a two lane interstate highway.</p><p>With the horizon clear of demons, Sam and Dean ducked inside the cab.</p><p>“How do you think she found us?” Julia asked. “Wasn’t James supposed to be her bloodhound?”</p><p>“Dumb luck,” Dean said. “We should have headed the other way. She won’t find us again. We’re going to be long gone.” He was sure of it.</p><p>Mike let them off 200 miles west of Chicago, just before Davenport. Walter, Julia, Sam, and Dean got off at an unmarked exit ramp. They thanked Mike for saving their lives.</p><p>“So now what?” Julia asked.</p><p>Dean noticed that Julia had ripped her skirt and her blouse had lost buttons.</p><p>“You need to get yourself some demon-fighting clothes,” he commented. “Those things aren’t going to cut it anymore.”</p><p>The four of them walked up the road in the twilight. Soon they came upon a friendly looking motel where each room was an individual little house. A small café was attached to the office.</p><p>“I think I’m going to check in, then go to bed,” Walter said wearily.</p><p>“Me too,” Sam said. “Dean?”</p><p>“Going to stay up for a bit. Sort of jacked up.”</p><p>Dean headed toward the café.</p><p>“I’ll join you,” Julia said.</p><p>“Why don’t you freshen up first, sweetheart.” Dean suggested with a hint of spite.</p><p>Julia nodded and headed toward the motel office.</p><p>Dean and Sam stood in the gravel parking lot watching Walter and Julia.</p><p>“Ditching them went well.” Dean looked at his brother. “Now what?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “Let’s sleep on it. Next thing we need to do is get the hell back home.”</p><p>“Any suggestions? Because I’m getting sort of tired of Pleasantville.”</p><p>“Let’s go back to Waubay, South Dakota, and hope Don has enough wherewithal to pick us up from there. I’ll go check us in.”</p><p>Dean noticed Julia standing in the doorway of her cottage. Moments later, Sam reappeared with two keys and threw one to Dean. He ducked inside his cabin.</p><p>Half an hour later, Dean lay on his bed. Sam had decided to grab some food after all. Dean was bored. There wasn’t a TV in the room, the only entertainment offered was a selection of black and white pamphlets explaining the local tourist attractions.</p><p>“Oh good, a milking museum,” Dean said to himself.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door.</p><p>“It’s open, Sam.”</p><p>Julia appeared in the doorway. She had changed into a sweater and jeans and a pair of hiking boots. Dean wondered where she’d managed to find clean clothes.</p><p>“May I come in?”</p><p>Dean sat up. “Sure, yeah.”</p><p>Julia shut the door, and leaned against it.</p><p>“Need some company?” She smiled.</p><p>“Not usually.”</p><p>“That was some fight back there,” she said, and sat down beside him on the bed.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “I have a feeling you’ve seen it all before. So tell me, what do you and your father really specialize in? It has to be something scholarly. I know—lying and stealing, maybe even some money laundering thrown in for good measure. Anything to survive—right?”</p><p>“I have a feeling you and your brother do the same.”</p><p>“Maybe, but you’re as fake as silicone, baby. And I hate silicone. Ruins the moment, you know.”</p><p>Julia let out a small laugh.</p><p>“Sometimes I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>She crept her hand closer to his. Dean looked down.</p><p>“Sweetheart, I’m tired. Anyway we can put this off until... say never?” Dean looked her in the eyes.</p><p>Julia didn’t seem to be putting on a front now. It had been a long time since Dean had spent this much time with a woman. The Apocalypse, Sam, Lucifer, it had all worn him down. He was on autopilot. Dean wondered whether he would wake up some day and his entire life would have been one bad dream.</p><p>“Maybe you like me so much because you know we are both always pretending to be someone else. I see myself in you.” Julia breathed shallowly. “Maybe you see yourself in me.”</p><p>“Wow, there are so many different ways I could take that.” Dean smiled. “But sorry, I don’t get close to people. Not in my line of work.”</p><p>“Me neither.”</p><p>“I doubt that very much.”</p><p>“Why can’t you be nice to me?”</p><p>“Not my nature. I’m a hunter, I don’t get close. It becomes your weakness. It’s bad enough to hunt with family.”</p><p>Julia nodded. “I know how you feel. My mother died at the hands of something evil. My father swore to avenge her death. And he did. He was born into this life. He never knew anything different. My mother, however, she didn’t pick this. She had no idea. I was only a baby when she died. So my father took me with him. I studied with him. I grew up knowing about demons, monsters—“</p><p>“Everything that goes bump in the night.”</p><p>“Yeah. I guess. There are a lot of people like us. A whole group of people we work with. We meet up every month and pool our resources. You would be amazed what you can get done in groups. Demons sure, but vampires, easy to wipe out with a group of a hundred hunters.”</p><p>“Wait a minute, you know a hundred hunters?” Dean stopped caressing her thigh for a moment.</p><p>“Yup. So if you’re hunters and we’re hunters, why haven’t we heard of you?” Julia asked.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “My father taught us to be on our own. He always said other hunters are fine for some jobs. But in order to keep moving, best to be by yourselves.”</p><p>“I guess so. Still strange though. We have an entire network of people and you’ve never come up.” Julia cocked her head to the side, looking at Dean.</p><p>“Like I said, best to be on your own.”</p><p>Dean’s cheeks flushed. He grabbed Julia by the wrist and pulled her on top of him. He held her head in his hands. She stared into his eyes.</p><p>“Why do you need the scrolls?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you that.”</p><p>“My father knew that he was destined to do something good for people. Then, when they started finding the Dead Sea Scrolls, he knew that he had to find the one scroll his mother always told him about. The ultimate battle plan for the war between good and evil. Hundreds of people have been waiting thousands of years for that scroll to appear. And your brother has it in his bag in a flour can.”</p><p>“Could be worse, I guess.” Dean shrugged.</p><p>“You really piss me off, you know that?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>Dean gave her a long kiss. Her lithe body relaxed on top of his. He pulled her sweater up over her head, and ran his hands over her sinewy back. She quickly undid his belt buckle with one hand. Dean raised an eyebrow, impressed. He kissed her again.</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Dean woke the next day, Sam was standing in the doorway. Silent. He made a face. Dean shrugged. Sam soundlessly closed the door behind him.</p><p>Dean looked at Julia still asleep beside him, then levered himself carefully out of bed. He grabbed his jeans and leather jacket, then struggled to get his boots on. He left the room and walked across the gravel parking lot. Sam was nowhere to be seen. Dean muttered curses under his breath. He needed coffee and Sam had wandered off like a kid at Disneyland.</p><p>Then Sam swung into the parking lot. Dean gulped as he saw his brother was driving a brand-new green-and-white 1953 Oldsmobile Fiesta. It had a large chrome grill like a duck bill on the front, white wall tires, 170 horsepower and two-tone seats. Only four were made in 1953.</p><p>“Do you know how much one of these is worth?” Dean said excitedly.</p><p>“Keep your voice down. The sticker price is $5,700. I found it in the glove compartment.”</p><p>“One of these sold at auction for 150 K, just last year. Well, you know, in fifty-five years. Man, I wish I could bring this back with me!”</p><p>“Speaking of which. Let’s get on the road. I have an idea that Don will know to look for us in Waubay.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Dean got into the passenger seat.</p><p>“You don’t want to drive?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Didn’t get much sleep.” Dean smirked. “By the way, they have a network of like a hundred hunters.”</p><p>Sam looked at his brother in surprise.</p><p>“You’re kidding me. We’ve never come across that big an organised group before. What do you think happened to them?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “And supposedly, they all know about the scroll. Specifically the War Scroll.”</p><p>Sam looked stunned. He pulled the car out onto the two-lane highway and headed north.</p><p>“How do they know about it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. A whole group of hunters all believing the scroll has a meaning. Sounds sort of like a cult. But they know about it, that’s for sure.”</p><p>“Do you think Julia and Walter told them?”</p><p>Dean looked out of the window. “Whether they did or not, we’ll be long gone into the future by the time they find out.”</p><p>For the first time since they were flung back to 1954, Dean felt a squeeze of regret. Sure he had spent loads of time with plenty of women. But it was true that very few of them meant anything to him. Somehow Julia seemed different. Not only did she know the life that Dean had grown up in, but she was similar to him. Dean never had trouble being himself around people—that insecurity type thing wasn’t his bag, there were too many other more important things to deal with—but Julia made Dean want to be better. Just being around her made him want to not be such a jerk. He’d been fighting it since they met. But somehow Julia had an affect on Dean. Oh my god, am I turning into Jack Nicholson in that Helen Hunt movie?</p><p>Dean swallowed and noticed there was a lump in his throat. He looked down at his sweaty hands leaving imprints on his jeans.</p><p>Sam glanced over at his brother.</p><p>“What’s your problem?” Sam raised a curious eyebrow.</p><p>“Nothing. Shut up.”</p><p>For about a hundred miles Dean stared out of the window. He kept going over and over in his mind the first time they had met. He didn’t feel guilty about leaving her. He had a job to do. He’d left plenty of women while they were sleeping.</p><p>So why was he feeling guilty now?</p><p>Seven hours later they pulled into Waubay. The town didn’t look much different in the 1950s, everything just looked fresher, the paint wasn’t peeling and the roads were newly paved. The bar where they would meet Don was basically the same, except the building didn’t have as many cracks in it.</p><p>They took a booth in the back and ordered two beers.</p><p>Sam brought out the flour can with the scroll stuffed inside.</p><p>“Put that away,” Dean hissed, scowling. “If Don zaps us back to 2010, we don’t want to accidentally leave the scroll behind.”</p><p>“So, I have a thought. If in the future only the last pages of the scroll are missing, what do you think happens to the rest of it? We know it eventually ends up back in Israel. How do you think it gets there?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Maybe Eli the garden gnome shows up again and takes it there. Who knows? I don’t care. We have the scroll, we’ve got what we came for.”</p><p>The Winchester brothers finished three more beers apiece. Still no Don. Dean was getting agitated. Local patrons had come and gone. The bartender had already given them complimentary fish sticks. But still Don was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“You think we should use the sigil?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No, that will invite every angel that’s on Earth right now. We’ve flown under the radar up until now, let’s not draw attention to ourselves.”</p><p>“Good point.”</p><p>The bar closed at twelve. The brothers thanked the bartender, a large gruff guy in a plaid shirt, and told him that if anyone showed up looking for them, they’d be at the motel down the road. The bartender nodded.</p><p>The next day, the boys resumed their vigil in the bar, still waiting for Don to zap them back to 2010.</p><p>“What the hell is taking him so long?” Dean growled.</p><p>“I don’t know. There really isn’t anything else to do but wait.”</p><p>“Great. Waiting around for another angel, exactly what I wanted to spend my life doing. At this rate we’ll be seventy by the time he shows up.” A cloud passed over Dean’s face. “You don’t think he’ll leave us here that long, do you?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But think about it this way—you could spend the rest of your life with Julia. Happily ever after.”</p><p>Dean knuckle punched Sam’s arm. “Shut up.”</p><p>He tried to change the subject. “Why don’t you just study up and translate the scroll? Maybe we can get out of here that way.”</p><p>“I’ve been trying. It’s beyond what I can translate, Dean. It’s ancient Aramaic, written in Aramaic script. It’s half language, half symbols. I have no idea what it says. Without Don we have no chance of finding out the final battle plan for Lucifer.”</p><p>“Well, can’t you learn?”</p><p>“I could, but we would need to go to a large university, like Chicago or Berkeley. The texts that would teach me ancient Aramaic aren’t just lying around the Waubay Library. And then I would need to study for months to be able to understand even the most elementary of symbols. I mean, look at it.”</p><p>Sam made sure no one in the bar was taking notice. Then carefully pulled out the scroll and smoothed it onto the table top.</p><p>“Look at how complicated this is. It’s not like learning an alphabet. There is a symbol for every word. And a sound that goes with every symbol.”</p><p>That was the end of the discussion.</p><p>On their third day of waiting around in Waubay, Dean got out of bed and looked out of the window at the foggy summer morning. They had to do something. This was ridiculous.</p><p>“Sam.”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>“Sam, wake up.”</p><p>Sam rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “I’m up. What?”</p><p>“We’ve got to call Julia and Walter. We need Walter to translate the scroll. It doesn’t matter anymore if he knows what the scroll says. Someone else will have to know what the last pages say besides us, right? We have to call them.”</p><p>“Dean, we have no way of getting in touch with them. They don’t have cell phones. I can try Walter’s office back at the Biblical Society in New York, but I doubt they went back there. What do you suggest? Besides, are you sure this isn’t because you just want to see Julia?”</p><p>“No, Sam, it’s not. We have nowhere else to turn. If you have a better idea, I’m all ears.”</p><p>Dean did in fact want to see Julia. Every fiber of his body wanted to, but his mind kept telling him, “No.”</p><p>In truth though, Julia and Walter were the only people they knew in 1954 that could help them. If they translated the page, they would have an idea how to defeat Lucifer. At least with that information they could call the angels to help them.</p><p>Sam and Dean had—very reluctantly on Dean’s part— ditched the Oldsmobile Fiesta and hotwired an old Chevy instead. It didn’t go very fast, but they didn’t want to draw attention to themselves anyway.</p><p>They rolled into a local electronics store. It was filled with black-and-white TVs. In the center of the store, on a raised platform covered in a green shag rug, was a color television. Mesmerized kids sat in a cluster in front of it. Even the adults couldn’t look away.</p><p>A guy in a brown suit approached Sam and Dean.</p><p>“Looking to buy a new television set, gentlemen? Look at this beauty, a hundred dollars, top of the line. Technicolor they call it. Look at that picture. It’s like you’re really there.”</p><p>“Thanks Crazy Eddie. Do you have CB radios?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Of course, all brand new. Biggest craze yet, huh? Right over here.”</p><p>Crazy Eddie led them to the back of the shop, where a series of CBs and ham radios were set up. None of them were plugged in.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. Sam looked at Dean. Eddie went back to the customers crowded around the color TV. Sam and Dean grabbed some equipment and hid it in their leather jackets.</p><p>As they walked out, Dean patted Crazy Eddie on the back.</p><p>“Thanks, think we’ll pass.”</p><p>“Anytime,” the man said genially.</p><p>Back at the motel, Sam and Dean set up the ham radio and CB.</p><p>“How do you know they’ll even be on a CB or ham radio?” Sam said as he plugged one of the units into the wall socket.</p><p>“Guess we’ll just have to chance it. How else is this group of hunters communicating?”</p><p>Sam and Dean spent the next couple of hours putting out feelers on the radio units.</p><p>“Breaker, breaker. Looking for Papa Bear and Baby Bear. Ten, thirty-five. We’re up in the land of the Walleye. Anyone read?”</p><p>Sam and Dean had no idea what Julia and Walter’s handle would be. But they had an idea that they would be monitoring the airwaves.</p><p>About six hours later, Julia’s voice crackled over the CB radio.</p><p>“This is Baby Bear.” Dean could tell from Julia’s tone that she wasn’t happy with his moniker for her.</p><p>“Is this Dopey? Come in Dopey?”</p><p>“Yeah Baby Bear, this is Dopey. You and Papa Bear want to meet up?”</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the radio.</p><p>Eventually, “What’s your twenty?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Two Pines Motel,” Dean said.</p><p>“Be there in twelve hours,” Julia responded. “Over and out.”</p><p>The radio was taken over by static. Dean looked at Sam.</p><p>“Aren’t you the least bit pissed that we didn’t know they were hunters?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What else can we do? Besides, does it matter? Let’s just get out of here as soon as we can.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Exactly twelve hours later, there was a knock on the motel room door. Julia and Walter stood in the doorway, wearing what looked like fishing gear.</p><p>“Were you fishing?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Trying not to draw attention to ourselves,” Julia said tersely as she pulled a large shotgun out of one leg of the rubber waders she had on. “Plus, it’s a good way to carry around firepower.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>Walter walked into the room and sat on the bed.</p><p>“So, you ditch us and now you need our help?” He stared pointedly at Dean.</p><p>Dean gulped. Had Julia told her father they slept together? Dean met Julia’s eyes. She looked away. That was an affirmative. Crap.</p><p>“So you can’t translate the scroll on your own. Just like you couldn’t have gotten it on your own. And now you need our assistance. Again,” Walter said.</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said. “It would take months. Can you help?”</p><p>“You’ve ditched us twice now. There is a hoard of demons looking for us because of you. I’m not quite sure what’s in it for Julia and me.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s because of us—“ Dean interrupted.</p><p>Walter held out his hand to stop him.</p><p>“Regardless, now you come begging for our help.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t exactly say begging,” Dean said.</p><p>“Boy, let me finish.”</p><p>Dean was about to tell Walter he reminded him a lot of their friend Bobby, but he decided to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>“Let’s get started,” Walter said.</p><p>Walter laid a large suitcase out on the bed. It was filled with loads of dusty texts—most looked even older than the ones he’d had in his office in New York.</p><p>“From my own private collection,” he said.</p><p>“Where did you get all of these?” Sam asked. He was amazed at the array of books. There were sixteenth-century Bibles, dozens of books in ancient Greek, even some old parchment scrolls.</p><p>“I’ve collected them since I was a boy, in anticipation of this very moment. We have a safe house south of here, and I locked them up in a bomb shelter there. I always knew they would be important.” Walter grew somber. “I’ve known about the existence of the scroll since I could talk. I knew I would one day hold it in my hands. It was my destiny. I’m part of the link in the chain to ultimately defeat evil. And that destiny is coming true.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a look but said nothing.</p><p>Walter pulled out the bedside table in between the twin beds, so it stood halfway down the beds. He then took the round side table and put that next to the bed on one side, and took a chair and put that on the other side of the other bed.</p><p>“Can I have the scroll?”</p><p>Sam reached into his bag and pulled out the steel flour can. Walter reached for it gingerly. He took out the scroll and gently laid it on the round side table. He spread the scroll out, end to end. The last couple of pages came to a rest on the chair.</p><p>“Walter, can we start from here?” Sam indicated. He knew exactly where the translation of the scroll in modern times had left off.</p><p>“Why? It’s a twelve-foot scroll.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. This time, a whole unspoken discussion passed between them. They couldn’t explain that they already knew what the first ten feet of the scroll said. Sam looked back at Walter.</p><p>“Legend has it that it’s a battle plan, right? So let’s start from the end. Eisheth is already on our tail. Let’s just cut to the chase. We can always go back.”</p><p>“You have a point. Okay. Let’s get started.”</p><p>Walter opened up each and every one of the books that he had brought. Leaning over the parchment, he traced a symbol with his finger then started paging through a book looking for its match.</p><p>“Grab one, this is how it’s done.”</p><p>Sam sat down on the floor, grabbed a book and started thumbing through it.</p><p>“I’m going to go get some air,” Dean said.</p><p>“Me too,” Julia agreed. “Dad, you okay?”</p><p>Walter waved her away.</p><p>Dean and Julia stepped outside. There was an awkward silence.</p><p>Julia broke first. “I bet you don’t call a lot of women after you spend the night with them.”</p><p>“Not usually. No.”</p><p>“So this is good, you can use my father just like you used me.”</p><p>Dean looked her in the eyes. “I didn’t use you. And as far as your father is concerned, he’s a grown man. He knows the deal. You’re hunters, right? Sometimes you use people for information—just like you used Sam and me back in New York.”</p><p>“That was different, I needed to find out who you were.”</p><p>“Well, now you know.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that I like you, now that I know the real you.”</p><p>Dean walked away from Julia across the parking lot.</p><p>“I wasn’t untruthful.” Julia followed him.</p><p>“You weren’t exactly forthcoming either.” He spun around. “All that bullshit about your father being a scholar, and then you show up here with an arsenal taped to your back. What else are you hiding? I mean, I like a girl with a hint of danger, but you’re far and away the most dangerous piece of ass I’ve ever had.”</p><p>Julia slapped him hard across the face.</p><p>“My father was a scholar. He is a scholar. But we have another life.”</p><p>Julia looked up at Dean with tears in her eyes.</p><p>“I have no choice. Don’t you understand that? Look at every other girl my age. They’re married, have a house, a husband. Kids. Do you know that by the age of nine, I knew I would never have that? Ever. That is not a normal existence. So excuse me if you didn’t get all the information. I had other things to do.”</p><p>“Like saving the world?”</p><p>“We don’t know what’s on the scroll. Maybe there is a part for me to play. I hope so. I don’t know. But I don’t have a choice. Do I?”</p><p>“No, you don’t. Nobody does. I’m finding that out.”</p><p>Standing next to Julia, watching the grass swaying in the warm evening breeze, Dean felt a brief moment of happiness. Strange as that is, he thought.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to slap you.”</p><p>Dean lifted her chin gently in his hands. He gave her a slow, deep kiss.</p><p>“You’re forgiven,” Dean said.</p><p>“That wasn’t an apology,” Julia huffed.</p><p>“It’ll do. Let’s get some coffee.”</p><p>Sam and Walter worked diligently into the evening translating the text. Walter knew a lot of symbols that weren’t in the books. It would have taken Sam a lot longer if he had done it on his own. But still, the process was laborious.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean and Julia sat in the café across the street from the motel.</p><p>“So, no picket fence for you?” Dean said, stirring his coffee.</p><p>“Don’t think so,” Julia absent-mindedly scribbled on a napkin. “So what about Eisheth, what can we do about her?”</p><p>“I don’t know. She’s supposed to guard the scroll that essentially tells the secret of how to destroy her husband. She’s going to go after it with everything she’s got. That’s why it’s so important that we find out what it says. If she shows up again, I have a feeling that she’s going to have made a lot more friends.”</p><p>A few hours later Dean and Julia headed back to the motel room.</p><p>Sam and Walter were wide awake and still working hard, though Sam’s hair was wet, so he must have just taken a shower. Walter peered at his daughter and Dean as they stood in the doorway.</p><p>“Shut the door. The scroll shouldn’t be exposed to the elements,” he said.</p><p>Dean sat down.</p><p>“Have you found anything?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Yes, and no,” Walter replied as he peered through a magnifying glass at the scroll.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Dean said with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>“Well, the text on top says that the battle lines are drawn with people’s faith. The believers versus the non-believers. In order to defeat Lucifer it says this, ‘The Adversary’s undoing lies in a trail of blood across the ages. All that become hosts must become ash.’”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. They knew what hosts becoming ash meant.</p><p>Oblivious, Walter carried on. “But often the writers of ancient scrolls tried to hide something beneath the actual text. They would create a chemical reaction which would reveal the true text. Sam and I finished and the text seemed pretty cut and dry. But then, Sam took a shower.”</p><p>“He always makes a mess, doesn’t he?” Dean said.</p><p>“Yes, he does. But the steam coupled with the water droplets coming off his body as he reached for another towel... Well, it produced this.”</p><p>Walter gently held up the last pages of the scroll. Though Aramaic script could be seen plainly on the page, another page seemed to be underneath it.</p><p>“It looks like a list,” Julia said.</p><p>“Yeah, it does.” Dean looked closer at the parchment.</p><p>“Can you tell what it says?” Julia asked.</p><p>“They’re names,” Walter said.</p><p>“Names?” Dean said, alarmed—your name on a scroll that Satan was trying to protect. Well, it couldn’t be good.</p><p>“But that’s not the most peculiar thing,” Walter said. “Some of the names belong to angels.”</p><p>“That’s weird.” Dean looked at his brother. Was there something more? Sam was eyeing Dean. Dean knew that look. It was the We gotta talk look.</p><p>“I think I have something in the car that can help,” Sam said. “Give me a sec.”</p><p>Sam and Dean walked outside to the parking lot.</p><p>“So, what did you really find?” Dean asked as soon as they were out of earshot.</p><p>“Walter’s right, they’re names—paired up with the names of angels.”</p><p>“So what, that’s what Don wanted us to find? A list of angel names.”</p><p>“Don’t you see, Dean, if the angels don’t have vessels, there’s no war. Yes, our names are on the scroll. But there’s more. It’s basically a roster of all the soldiers in a battle. But we’re here for a different reason.”</p><p>“That was his plan? No vessels, no fight?” Dean punched a car hood. “That’s ridiculous. I’m going to kill him when I see him.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “The demons aren’t going to kill these people... Abaddon sent us to do it...”</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The four of them sat in the motel room largely in silence as Walter transcribed the names, slowly but surely teasing out the angels’ most monumental secret.</p><p>The scroll associated each angel with the bloodline of his or her potential vessels. Sometimes only one host was listed, sometimes many. When Walter got to the line that read, “‘Castiel—borne by the progeny of Ishmael: Gregory Novak, who begat James Novak, who begat Claire Novak,’” Dean’s jaw clicked shut. Sam looked over at his brother. They had met Castiel’s vessel, Jimmy Novak, and his daughter Claire, while Cass was being interrogated in Heaven.</p><p>The process dragged on, as each name required Walter’s deliberation. Meanwhile, Sam had surreptitiously started translating from the bottom of the page, where the very last name seemed to read: “Michael—borne by the Sons of Light, John Winchester, who begat Dean Winchester.” It would take Walter another hour to get there. And then, Sam thought, they’ll know everything.</p><p>“Stop,” Dean blurted out suddenly.</p><p>All eyes turned to him.</p><p>“Stop writing.”</p><p>Walter let slip an exasperated breath, but continued to scan his magnifying glass over the tiny sigils.</p><p>“Every minute the scroll spends exposed to moisture degrades the pigment,” he muttered impatiently.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said, “‘cause we’re not doing this.” Grabbing the battered and fragile parchment away from Walter, Dean made for the door.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Julia asked, hurt in her voice. “We finally get a chance to read the thing, and you want to walk away?”</p><p>“Are you not paying attention? Damn thing wants us to butcher a thousand innocent people.”</p><p>“More,” Walter corrected simply. “At least 2,000.”</p><p>Dean held the parchment up to the light. “We’re in this to save lives, not end them. This list—these people haven’t done anything wrong.”</p><p>Walter never took his eyes from the scroll, as if breaking his gaze would cause it to crumble.</p><p>“They’re angelic vessels,” he said calmly. “Both sides in the final battle are angels... and with no hosts, they can’t fight. No Apocalypse. One of the people on this list will be Lucifer’s host on Earth, and we have the chance to kill him.”</p><p>Dean looked to Sam to back him up, but his younger brother was looking away, lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>“Dean, remember why we did this. All of us.” Julia stepped closer to him, her hand beginning to reach out for the scroll. “We want the same thing, and this is how we get it.”</p><p>Dean’s mind was racing. After all, their points were entirely valid. One way or another, the angels were ultimately responsible for the Apocalypse, and killing their vessels would rob them of their foothold on Earth.</p><p>It would also rob the entire Winchester family of their lives.</p><p>“The price is too high,” Dean said softly, despite his thoughts to the contrary. If only dying was enough.</p><p>“What happens to mankind when Lucifer rises?” Walter demanded. “‘And they came forth, winging from Heaven and Hell to the place between. The fates of men hung on their swords, in a place called Armageddon.’”</p><p>Dean recognized the curious quote from one of the more gruesome editions of The Book of Revelation that John Winchester had carried.</p><p>“Billions dead,” Walter said.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, without acknowledging the others, Sam pulled himself out of his chair and left the room. Dean stared after him, imagining how he must be feeling. A 2,000-year-old scroll just told him his family has to die so that he can’t destroy the world. Probably not feeling great.</p><p>“I know the figures,” Dean said to Walter. “Planetary enema, half the world on fire, all of it. That doesn’t change what’s right and wrong.”</p><p>“None of it is right. But there are two options, and one of them is a lot less wrong.” Walter’s lower lip trembled with emotion. “Three billion strangers versus 2,000 strangers.”</p><p>“The difference is who kills them,” Dean shot back.</p><p>“I don’t want to kill anyone,” Walter said. “But I can’t live out the rest of my life knowing the end is coming, and... and not do anything.”</p><p>“What if it’s wrong?” Julia said hesitantly.</p><p>Walter stared at her for a moment, not understanding.</p><p>“What if the list is wrong, and none of these people are vessels?” she persisted.</p><p>Walter huffed at her, incredulous. “This document was written millennia ago, and it lists a ‘Craig Masterson’ and a ‘Danny Fuller’. Do those names sound ancient to you?”</p><p>“So they were clued in to the future,” Dean said. “The future can change.”</p><p>“No, it can’t,” Walter replied. “Destiny does not change.”</p><p>“My life hasn’t been decided, buddy,” Dean blurted.</p><p>Walter paled, his frown deepening.</p><p>“There will be another way to stop Lucifer,” Dean insisted. “There has to be.”</p><p>With a nod, Walter sat back down. “When I was eight years old, my father bought an automobile. The first in our town. Every boy in my class wished their father could do the same, but... for most of them, it would be years before they could afford it. Two weeks later, my father was the first person in town to crash a Model T. First person to die in an automobile accident.”</p><p>Dean didn’t know where the old man was going with the story, but decided he was better off listening than interrupting. He knew from experience that “dead dad” tales were a sensitive subject.</p><p>Walter continued. “My mother told me, ‘This is what God wanted for him.’ That there was a plan. But deep down, I knew there wasn’t. It was senseless and stupid and unfair. For years, I hated her for saying that. And then, after I’d grown up a bit, I learned the truth. It hadn’t been an accident. My father had been killed by a demon. Protecting me while I slept.” Walter paused for a moment, observing Dean’s muted reaction. “There was a purpose to it. A plan. He gave his life for mine, so that I could be here for this.”</p><p>It was all Dean could do not to roll his eyes.</p><p>“This moment, this choice, it’s what my mother warned me about. It’s fate—“</p><p>“It’s bull,” Dean snarled. “That’s a swell sob story, but I’ve got one just like it. Only my dad didn’t give his life so I could go on to murder innocent people, he gave his life so... so I could get a fair shake. That’s it.” Thinking about John Winchester was always difficult for Dean, especially when he was forced to marginalize his sacrifice. “If he could have kept me from this life, he would have. Same with my mom. I’m sorry to say it, but just about everyone in this line of work loses someone to it eventually.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a cold look, but he soldiered on.</p><p>“It doesn’t give you a special destiny. It gives you attachment issues and a manageable drinking problem.”</p><p>Frustrated, Walter tried another tack. “This is bigger than all of us. We have to at least let the others weigh in.”</p><p>“Others?”</p><p>“The rest of the hunters, at our headquarters.”</p><p>Dean’s confused look drew suspicion from Walter.</p><p>“You weren’t kidding about doing things your own way. Never heard of a hunter that didn’t report in at least once in a great while.”</p><p>“We’ve never been to... ‘headquarters.’ And we don’t plan on going now.”</p><p>“I can’t let you walk off with the scroll, Dean.”</p><p>“And I can’t let you kill those people!”</p><p>Walter looked Dean in the eye and said with calm authority, “Hand back the scroll, or things are going to get ugly.”</p><p>From beneath the table, Dean heard the unmistakable click of a revolver’s hammer pulling back.</p><p>He had no choice but to comply.</p><p>Sam kicked at the dirt of the parking lot, watching the dust fly up into gloomy clouds that reflected his mood perfectly. He could hear Dean inside, talking to Walter and Julia, but didn’t want to be anywhere near that conversation. The idea that Sam’s death could halt the Apocalypse in its tracks wasn’t a new one—in fact, he himself had thought of it almost immediately after learning that he was Lucifer’s chosen vessel. To have it be Abaddon’s promised solution, however, was devastating. Sam had long ago given up on any hope of a normal life, but giving up on life entirely, along with all of those unknowing souls? He remembered what he had read about Abaddon back in New York. I should have known this would turn out badly, I should have warned Dean. He had wanted to find another way so badly that he had allowed them to walk into this trap.</p><p>When Dean exited the motel room and ambled toward him, Sam made a concerted effort to reign in his emotions.</p><p>“Sammy...”</p><p>“You don’t have to say it. You’re going to figure something out, we’ll stop them from committing mass murder, I know.”</p><p>“No, just... I’m sorry. I know how much was riding on that being the thing to get us out of this mess. And now, it just gets messier.”</p><p>Sam nodded toward the motel. “Where’d you leave things?”</p><p>“At gunpoint. Walter’s convinced this is his destiny, like he’s the Luke Skywalker of the Apocalypse, and that list is going to bring down the Emperor.”</p><p>“Well, it would,” Sam offered. “I mean, the plan would work, right? Cut off the angels from their vessels, they can’t fight the final battle—even using backups.”</p><p>“You’re not actually thinking about this, are you?” Dean asked, his brow furrowing.</p><p>“I’m... I don’t know. What I do know is that if it came down to it, we’d both...”</p><p>“We’d do what we had to do,” Dean said. “Hell, we’ve both died before. But we’re not there yet. And this isn’t just our lives we’re talking about, it’s 2,000 people, probably mostly children. People that have no part in this besides drawing the short straw, genetically speaking.”</p><p>Sam nodded his agreement, but his heart wasn’t in it. Part of him had always wished for an easy way out, and sudden lack-of-existence would certainly do the trick. He tried to change the subject.</p><p>“What are they going to think when they get to the end of the list, and there we are?”</p><p>“Let’s not even go there,” Dean replied. “What I don’t get is why Abaddon would send us here in the first place. Says he wants to defeat the Devil and go on sipping pina coladas for the rest of eternity on Earth. But think about it, if we destroy all the vessels, that means his, too.”</p><p>“So he’d be stuck in Hell.”</p><p>“And he said that he wanted Lucifer to be destroyed entirely, but this would just keep him locked up,” Dean added.</p><p>“With Abaddon stuck guarding him,” Sam continued.</p><p>Both of them paused to reflect on the pretzel that was temporal mechanics. Then Sam chimed back in. “He must not have known exactly what was on the scroll...”</p><p>“Or he’s just another angel douche, playing us for fools,” Dean said bitterly.</p><p>“Where does that leave us?”</p><p>“Screwed, as usual,” Dean said.</p><p>“What if... what if we’re the ones who destroy it?” Sam ventured.</p><p>“Back up.”</p><p>“In 2010, history records that the last page is missing or destroyed. What if we’re the ones who destroy it? To stop Walter from fulfilling his... destiny, or whatever.”</p><p>“Then we’re going to have to fight our way past Walter to get it,” Dean answered. “He’s not going to let that thing out of his sight again, not after we got the slip on him the last time.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean seriously. “Could you do it?”</p><p>“Kill Walter?” The words rolled a little too effortlessly off Dean’s tongue.</p><p>Outwardly, it seemed as though the notion didn’t faze Dean, but Sam knew it did. Dean would never admit to having a soft spot, but right now, it was the exact size and shape of Julia. In fact, it was a novelty for Sam to be on the other side of their usual dynamic—instead of being the lovestruck kid brother falling for the wrong woman, he was the protective one waiting for the right time to intervene. After what had happened with Ruby, Sam doubted if he’d ever again be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman. Not that it matters, since I’ll probably be dead soon. God, that wasn’t morbid at all.</p><p>Dean stared back at the motel room.</p><p>“No. Probably couldn’t,” he conceded.</p><p>“Guess we need another plan,” Sam said, relieved by his brother’s candid response.</p><p>“Yeah.” Dean kicked at the dirt, billowing it into a gloomy cloud, matching the one Sam had made earlier. “I think I’ve got one.”</p><p>Later that evening, Dean went looking for Julia. He found her scrubbing the bands of her car’s CB radio, listening for any hint of voices in the static. Before alerting her to his presence, he took the opportunity to watch her with her guard down. He imagined that she carried herself differently when she thought no one was watching—that he could see the ‘real’ Julia underneath the layers of defenses.</p><p>“I know you’re watching me, Dean, and it’s creepy.”</p><p>Guess that theory’s shot.</p><p>“I came to see if we could mend some fences,” Dean said.</p><p>“Nothing to mend. You made it pretty clear what your intentions are regarding the scroll.”</p><p>“And now we share the biggest secret that anybody’s ever kept. The key to stopping the Devil. And that means we’re going to have to work on our trust issues.”</p><p>Wearily she looked at Dean. “I don’t have the energy to get into all of our issues.”</p><p>“The way I see it, I have no choice but to trust you.”</p><p>“Why’s that?” she asked.</p><p>“Because without your help, I’m not going to be able to stop your dad from murdering a lot of innocent people. And the only way I’ll be able to convince you to help me is to tell you the complete God’s honest truth, and that means trusting you not to flip out when you hear it.”</p><p>“I’m a big girl.”</p><p>Dean sized her up. “Not that big.”</p><p>“My dad has been working toward this his whole life. What makes you think I can convince him of anything?”</p><p>“You’re his daughter. That’s how daughters work. Look at Paris Hilton, she runs around showing off her hoo-ha and her dad just keeps refilling her checking account.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Right. See, that’s the problem. Different frames of reference.”</p><p>“Get to the point, Dean.”</p><p>“Fine. You and I are both hunters. We both have missions to complete, it’s just that... mine has taken me a little farther from home.”</p><p>“How far?”</p><p>“Fifty-six years.”</p><p>Dean could see that Julia was trying to process the information, but she gave no indication as to whether she believed it was true or not.</p><p>“Let me go back to the beginning,” Dean said.</p><p>“That would be helpful.”</p><p>“With a father like yours, you must know the story of Lucifer and Michael. Lucifer loves God more than anything else, but can’t stand his creations. Us. He doesn’t think we deserve to live in Paradise. He rebels, and big brother Michael has to put him down. Sweet family story.”</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, Julia turned off the buzzing CB radio, focusing her attention on Dean.</p><p>“Lucifer spends all his time in the pit gearing up for the rematch. But, it’s not that simple. First, he has to be let out. Second, the rematch has to take place on Earth, so he has to find the perfect meatsuit to jump into, and Michael has to find his. And here’s the kicker, their vessels... have to be brothers. ‘So it is in Heaven, so shall it be on Earth.’”</p><p>Realization began to dawn on Julia’s face. Dean hurried to finish before the inevitable questions started.</p><p>“A battle for the fate of Earth, fought by two of the names on that list in there. And it’s true, if all those bloodlines were cut, the angels would be all dressed up with no place to go. But Walter’s wrong about one thing. They’re not strangers.”</p><p>“You...”</p><p>“... and Sam. Hounded by this crap since birth. And fifty-five years from now, Lucifer will be freed. The Apocalypse will start. And we’ll find a way to stop it. Without killing hundreds of people.”</p><p>Julia turned away, pushed one step too far.</p><p>“So, let me get this straight, you’re a time-traveling angel-vessel from the future.”</p><p>“I’m the angel vessel. Michael’s.”</p><p>“And Sam... is Lucifer.”</p><p>“His vessel. Yes. But angels, even fallen ones, aren’t like demons—they need permission to come in. And Sam won’t give it.”</p><p>“If you really believe that, you wouldn’t be so desperate to find another way to stop him.”</p><p>“I trust my little brother.”</p><p>“You don’t trust anyone, Dean. Even now, you’re thinking of ways to take back everything you just said.”</p><p>“What makes you think that?”</p><p>“Because that’s what I’d be doing. This line of work isn’t designed to let people make friends. Even if they’re family.”</p><p>“Well, Sam’s all I’ve got,” Dean said. “And if you think I’m going to let Walter murder him...”</p><p>“If your story’s true, you’ve seen the start of the Apocalypse. And as a hunter, you’re not willing to do whatever it takes to stop it?”</p><p>“There’s another way. We’ll find it.”</p><p>“We go out every day and put our lives on the line for other people. This is the single biggest evil sonofabitch there ever will be, and that’s not big enough for you to lay down in front of?”</p><p>“Hunters don’t lay down. If I’m going down, I’m going down swinging.”</p><p>Julia’s mouth curled into a half-smile. “Okay.” She turned away from him. “Right answer. But... what makes you think there’s another way? Chances like this don’t come twice...”</p><p>As earnest as he’d ever been, Dean moved to look her right in the eye.</p><p>“I have to believe that there is. Your dad... he wants his destiny. Sammy and me, we don’t. Most days, I wake up and feel like running. But this is what we’re saddled with, so we’re going to find our way out from under it. But fifty-six years from now. Not today. Not like this.”</p><p>“You said you’d put your trust in me, but you’re asking me to put a hell of a lot of trust in you. I’m supposed to trust my grandchildren’s lives to you being able to punt your way out of this.”</p><p>“I thought you didn’t want the picket fence.”</p><p>“I want it, Dean, I’m just smart enough to know I’ll never get it,” she said sadly.</p><p>Dean was entirely spent. There was nothing else he could say to her that hadn’t already been said, so he went back to the beginning.</p><p>“Talk to Walter.”</p><p>She nodded, but didn’t say a word. Her facial expression was unreadable.</p><p>“We save people. We don’t murder them.”</p><p>“Let me sleep on that,” she said as she walked away.</p><p>* * *</p><p>It was late, and Dean forced himself to go to bed. There was nothing for him to do besides wait, putting him in an uncomfortably passive position. As a hunter, his tactic had always been to keep moving, to keep testing every option until he found a solution, but that rarely involved letting a woman ‘sleep on’ the most important decision of her life.</p><p>Sam was already asleep in his bed. Instinctively wary, Dean locked the door to their room and checked the windows were sealed. He trusted Julia; he had to. But now she knew that, in theory at least, Sam’s death could save the world from the Apocalypse, it didn’t hurt to take some precautions.</p><p>Despite all of the thoughts swirling in his head, the comfortable mattress and backlog of sleep deprivation quickly took its toll, and he fell asleep with his shotgun beside him.</p><p>When Dean awoke, the sun was shining brightly in through the motel window. It’s got to be least 10 a.m., he realized.</p><p>Swinging out from under the covers, Dean noticed the empty bed next to his. He had a moment of panic—where was Sam? But he pushed it aside, Sam always wakes up early. He’s probably grabbing some coffee. Stepping outside, he felt the cool morning breeze on his skin. It would have been refreshing, if he wasn’t in such a hurry to hear what Julia had to say.</p><p>Stopping outside her door, he raised his hand to knock, then thought better of it. Serious morning breath. Should have brushed before I came over. He and Julia obviously had no future together—since her future was in the distant past—but that didn’t mean Dean had given up entirely.</p><p>As he turned back toward his room, Julia’s door swung open.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, framed in the open doorway, a broken look on his face. “We have a problem. They’re gone, and they took the scroll.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-28">CHAPTER 28</span><a href="#chapter-28" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Throughout Dean’s life, he’d been betrayed by anyone who had got close to him. With Julia he had allowed himself to hope, even though, Dean realized, it was an idiotic notion to fall in love with someone born fifty years before him.</p><p>A burning anger bubbled up within him. He returned to their room and headed straight for the closet.</p><p>“They said they weren’t going to make any moves until we talked about it some more,” Sam said.</p><p>“Well, they lied. Seems like Walter’s plan to play a part in saving humanity means he’s going to do whatever it takes.”</p><p>“Aren’t we as well?”</p><p>Dean stared at his brother. “We’re not killing people, Sam.”</p><p>“How are we going to find them? We have no idea where they’ve gone.”</p><p>Dean held up the cord of the CB radio.</p><p>“We’re going to track them as we go.”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they pulled into the electronics store. As they raced inside Crazy Eddie was there, smiling broadly.</p><p>“Good morning gentlemen. Can I hel—“</p><p>Dean put his hand in his face.</p><p>“We’re taking some equipment.”</p><p>Dean pulled a CB converter off the wall, and Sam grabbed a large extendable antenna. They left without saying another word to the store clerk.</p><p>“You’ve got to pay for those!” Eddie called after them.</p><p>Sam assembled the gear as Dean drove. The plan was to find the signal that Walter and Julia were using, and quickly, before they could tell anyone about the list. But chances were slim. They had no idea which direction Walter and Julia had gone in. Moreover they had no idea what kind of hunter network they were a part of. John Winchester had always taught his boys a sort of code: they might have to kill the bodies demons inhabited, but they don’t kill people. From the conversations they had had last night, it seemed that not all hunters thought that way. To Julia and Walter, the greater good was worth sacrificing some human life.</p><p>Dean gripped the steering wheel; all these things flying through his mind as they burned down the freeway.</p><p>Sam regarded his brother. Sam was pissed. Dean knew better than to get involved with someone, especially another hunter. Just at the time when the outcome of the Apocalypse would be determined by whether Sam and Dean could find away to keep Lucifer and Michael at bay, Dean decides to get involved with a chick. Sam knew his brother would never let him get away with that if the tables were reversed. Example, Ruby.</p><p>Sam fiddled with the CB radio, but all they heard were truckers all over the Midwest; not one spec of evidence that Walter and Julia were out there.</p><p>Dean pulled over for gas. They had been driving south in a crisscross fashion for hours. The new Oldsmobile they had hotwired was a gas-guzzler.</p><p>Dean hit the head at the rest stop. Staring into the mirror in the men’s room, he wondered if they would ever be able to leave 1954. Would they run into their father at some point? Would this mean that they would never be born? How long could they live in the past? Would they even age? Dean took off his jacket and set it on one of the sinks. He ran some water over his face. As he reached for his jacket, he noticed a small piece of paper hanging out of the inside breast pocket.</p><p>It was a napkin from the café across the street from the motel. On it was scribbled a little drawing that Julia had doodled while they were having coffee the previous night. It was an arch, with little stick people figures underneath it. Dean had teased Julia that she was terrible at drawing, and that he would never pick her to be on his Pictionary team. She didn’t understand the reference, but she did give him the drawing. The arch looked like it could be the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Dean could be totally wrong, but it was the only lead they had.</p><p>“They’re in St. Louis.” Dean jumped into the driver’s seat.</p><p>“How do you know?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean held up the napkin. “Julia drew this, sort of looks like the St. Louis Arch, right? I wasn’t paying attention to what she was doing. I bet that’s where they’re based. When we called them on the CB, it took them twelve hours to get to us. It’s a twelve-hour drive to St. Louis, especially in these old cars.”</p><p>“They have a twelve-hour jump on us. Let’s get going.”</p><p>Dean hit the gas and headed due south.</p><p>Around eight hours later, as they reached the outskirts of St. Louis, they turned on the CB again.</p><p>Dean nodded toward the radio. “Flip through, see if you can’t get a higher frequency for any emergency calls.”</p><p>Sam did as he was told. Surveying the upper frequencies of the CB might lead them to any emergency calls coming into the St. Louis Police Department. If Walter and Julia were serious about killing off some of the angelic bloodlines, there probably would be some witnesses to the violence. Unless they were really, really good.</p><p>In a quiet residential street, Dean pulled over to the side of the road. It was around eight p.m., the sun was going down and several families were out for an evening stroll.</p><p>Sam diligently switched through the frequencies, going all the way up and then back down again. Then he caught it. It was faint, but they had picked up the local police radio.</p><p>They listened for more than an hour. All the police calls were for public drunkenness or the occasional domestic dispute. Dean leaned back and closed his eyes. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Dana Mey Smith was on her hands and knees looking underneath the bed for Bertrand.</p><p>“Found him!” She appeared back at her son’s bedside with the erstwhile missing bear. “Don’t let him drop down there again,” she said with a sincere maternal voice.</p><p>Dana smoothed down the blond cowlick of her son’s hair; ever since he was born, the absurd tuft of hair had adorned her son’s forehead. If it hadn’t smoothed out in five years, she was certain it was never going to. But at least the hair’s disposition fit the popular hairstyles of the times.</p><p>“I won’t,” Cory said as he closed his eyes contentedly and turned over.</p><p>Dana tiptoed out of his room and down the stairs. At first she didn’t notice anything out of place. It was still hot in her small two-story Victorian, though she kept all the windows open all the time when it was the middle of summer like this. And she didn’t lock the door because Greg would be returning home from his shift. So it wasn’t unusual to have the long curtains move in the breeze. But as Dana turned toward the kitchen, she saw a figure outlined in the curtain. The figure was tall and dressed in black clothing with a ski mask on his face. She screamed.</p><p>He moved toward her. She screamed again and tried to run toward the back door. The man tackled her to the floor. She tried to knee him in the groin, but he was far too fast and too strong.</p><p>Dana felt her head hit the floor. A hot tingling feeling ran from her ears to her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t have any money. I don’t have any money,” she cried through her tears.</p><p>The figure put his hands around her throat and started to squeeze. She struggled at first, pulling at the fists around her neck. In a matter of thirty seconds her body went limp.</p><p>The man got up off the floor and pulled the dead body into a pantry inside the kitchen.</p><p>“Ma!” a small voice called from the front of the house.</p><p>The figure turned, his eyes shifting around the living room. He peeled off his ski mask. The man’s sandy blond hair was matted down with sweat. He put on a smile and approached the stairs. On the top of the landing was a small boy, about four or five years old. He was in his pajamas.</p><p>“Ma, Bertrand fell again.” The little boy’s eyes focused on the man in black, standing at the bottom of the stairs. “Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m a friend of your mom’s.” The man said through a plastered-on smile. “Can I help you find Bertrand?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>The man had just stepped onto the staircase when the door flew open. A policeman stopped in his tracks, and surveyed the situation. The man opened his mouth as if to offer some excuse. That’s when the cop tackled him. Cory screamed and ran back to his room.</p><p>The man drew a knife and plunged it into the cop’s soft belly. The dead weight collapsed onto him, but he managed to roll out from underneath.</p><p>A second, younger cop appeared at the door, gun drawn. The intruder rose to his full height. The cop let loose three bullets, but two went wide, with the third passing straight through the man’s shoulder. He turned and took off through the back of the house. The cop dove over his partner in pursuit, but the man had apparently vanished into the summer night.</p><p>He returned to his partner’s side and fell to his knees. The prone cop opened his shirt to reveal the deep stab wounds. He tried to speak, but a stream of blood poured out of his mouth. His eyes rolled back. He was dead.</p><p>Sam and Dean had heard the police call. Following the patrol car to the scene, Dean left Sam waiting outside, while he headed around the side of the house.</p><p>“Dean, he’s coming through the back!” Sam yelled.</p><p>Hearing his brother, Dean jumped a fence and went around the back. That’s when he saw the man in black sprint out of the house across the backyard. Dean took off after him.</p><p>The man vaulted over a six-foot wooden fence. Dean was close behind. He reached for the guy’s black sweater. It half ripped as he pulled away, but the small delay allowed Dean to punch him in the back of the throat with his right hook. The man fell to the ground. Dean flipped him over and started pummeling him in the face.</p><p>“You a hunter? Hey, you a hunter?” Dean growled.</p><p>“Go to Hell,” the man spat.</p><p>“Been there, done that.” Dean punched the guy in the ear, knocking him out.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam hissed.</p><p>“Over here.”</p><p>Sam appeared with a flashlight. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Sam took the guy’s legs and Dean wrapped his arms underneath his shoulders. They made their way to the car, opened the trunk, swiftly bound the guy’s hands and feet and roughly folded him inside.</p><p>Then they jumped into the front seats and took off.</p><p>The brothers pulled into a motel, checked in, and, under the cover of night, carried the guy into their room.</p><p>Dean threw a cup of cold water at the man’s face. He opened his eyes and tried to move.</p><p>“Hey, get these off me!” He struggled against his bonds.</p><p>“You need to answer some questions first,” Dean said.</p><p>“Screw you. You have no idea what you’re dealing with.”</p><p>Sam leaned over the guy menacingly. “You just murdered two people. We’ll be happy to let you go. I’m sure the police will completely understand as they tear you limb from limb. They have the death penalty in Missouri, Dean?”</p><p>“Please, it’s 1954, of course they do.”</p><p>“Fine, what do you want to know?” the man hissed.</p><p>“What were you doing in that woman’s house?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“I was asked to do a job. I did it.”</p><p>“Who asked you?”</p><p>“I don’t know, never saw the guy. He called me up and said he wanted some skirt laid up, and I told him my price.”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“Normally I don’t like to kill ladies. But he offered me a grand.”</p><p>“A grand to kill a woman? And the kid?”</p><p>“I didn’t know there was a kid. I wasn’t going to hurt him. Honest.”</p><p>“How were you going to collect the money?”</p><p>“The guy said to call him and we would meet up.”</p><p>“You really think you were going to get paid? Do you even know where this guy lives?”</p><p>“I’m not an idiot. I got a bead on him. He’s some old guy.”</p><p>Dean’s face hardened; deep down he was still hoping their suspicions were wrong and Julia and Walter weren’t behind this. But he had a bad feeling they were right.</p><p>“Call him.” Dean grabbed the telephone off the night-stand and forced the receiver into the guy’s face.</p><p>“Um, hello? Hands are tied.”</p><p>“What’s the number?” Dean held his hand over the rotary telephone. “Come on.”</p><p>The guy recited the number. Dean put the receiver to his ear. On the other end of the line it rang, and then there was a female voice.</p><p>“Hello? Hello?”</p><p>Dean scowled—it was Julia. She and Walter had hired someone to kill the first of the angelic vessels.</p><p>“Hello? Is anyone there?” Julia said impatiently.</p><p>Sam quickly took the receiver from Dean, and put it up to the guy’s ear. He motioned for him to speak.</p><p>“Hey, it’s Grant. Deed’s done. When can we meet up?”</p><p>“One second,” the end of the line was silent for a moment. “Rick’s Drive-In. One hour. I’ll see you.”</p><p>There was a click. The guy looked up at Dean and Sam.</p><p>“Can you loosen these ropes now? I can’t feel my dick.”</p><p>Dean punched him hard in the face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-29">CHAPTER 29</span><a href="#chapter-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It was around midnight, and the drive-in was hopping. Dean pulled the car into the darkest corner of the parking lot. They had bound the guy in the backseat, and tied him down.</p><p>“Hey, I can’t see. How are you going to find her?”</p><p>“We’ll find her,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean noticed a young couple making out in the car nearest to them. The windows were all steamed up.</p><p>“Very American Graffiti” he spat.</p><p>Sam leaned back and stuffed the nose of the gun into the guy’s stomach.</p><p>“Remember, if you mention one word about the kid to them, you’re dead. You understand?” Sam’s face and voice made it clear that he was completely serious.</p><p>“Yeah, man. I get it. It’s cool man,” he grunted.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Julia and Walter pulled up in a station wagon. They took an end parking space, closest to the exit. If Julia looked in her rearview she might see them, but she was engrossed in surveying the people milling under the bright lights of the drive-in’s carport.</p><p>Dean reached into the back of the car with his hunting knife and cut the cords on the guy’s wrists.</p><p>“Go get your money, scumbag.” Dean opened the back door.</p><p>The man scrambled out of the car and approached the back of Julia’s on the driver’s side. She swiveled around as he approached. Twenty yards back, Sam and Dean watched from inside their car. The guy touched his face, where Dean had repeatedly punched him. From afar, it seemed like he was making some excuse for his appearance. Julia passed over an envelope. The guy glanced back at Sam and Dean and then started walking at a rapid pace through the crowd around the driv e-in.</p><p>“You’re just going to let him go?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have bigger fish to fry,” Dean said coldly.</p><p>Dean watched Julia pull the car out of the parking lot. They followed slowly behind.</p><p>Julia turned right onto a main street and headed for downtown St. Louis. Dean stayed two car lengths behind her; he didn’t take his eyes off the station wagon.</p><p>“Dean, try to calm down. We’ll figure this out,” Sam said as tactfully and gently as he could.</p><p>“Leave me alone, Sam.” Dean gripped the steering wheel even tighter. “She just murdered an innocent woman. She’s a liar. Who knows how many other people died tonight? I’m not going to let any more people get killed because of this God-damned Apocalypse.”</p><p>Sam was silent. They drove for the next twenty minutes without speaking.</p><p>Julia pulled into a large brick industrial-era warehouse on the outside of town. She drove the car around back, so it was hidden from the street. Dean idled the car at the curb. He was perfectly still.</p><p>“Do you want me to go in?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No,” Dean said, shaking the cobwebs away. “I’m good. I got this.”</p><p>They took two shotguns, one salt-filled and one they had loaded with regular bullets, and of course Ruby’s knife.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Dean said.</p><p>He headed off into the dark toward the looming building. Sam followed close behind. They crept around the back of the structure and spotted half a dozen cars. There were no lights. But it didn’t look like anyone was lurking around. A large steel door was cut into the back of the building. Dean tried to push it, but it was locked from the inside. It would probably make too much noise to open it anyway. He spotted a six foot-long transom window, which was about nine feet off the ground and swung open from the top.</p><p>“Sam, give me a lift.”</p><p>Just then a large bear of a guy careened around the corner and barreled headfirst into Sam. Sam went down in a heap.</p><p>Dean swung at the guy with the end of his shotgun. It connected right under the guy’s chin, but only sent him stumbling back a couple of steps. Dean picked up a handful of gravel and threw it in the guy’s face, momentarily blinding him. He threw a blind swing and went down on his ass. Dean leap on top of him, and landed elbow first, smashing into the big man’s kidneys. He curled up like an infant. Dean put both hands round the guy’s throat, constricting his airway until his face turned purple. Just before the guy passed out, Dean let go. That should keep him down for a little while.</p><p>Dean held out his hand to Sam. “Come on, let’s go. Stop laying around.”</p><p>“Do you think there are more of them?” Sam asked, rubbing his head.</p><p>“That guy was big enough to be three guys. Come on. Alley-oop.”</p><p>Sam held Dean by the knee. Pushing his weight up, he managed to grasp the ledge above. In an impressive rock-climbing move, Dean swung his leg onto the cement ledge underneath the window, pulling himself so he was half inside the building and half out, balancing on his stomach.</p><p>He disappeared into the black interior of the building.</p><p>Sam was glad that the little bit of action had made Dean communicative again. When Dean was silent and brooding things could get rough.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Dean pushed open the large steel door.</p><p>“This place is a fortress. Not good,” Dean said as he slid the steel portal closed behind Sam.</p><p>Inside the building, there was a steel staircase that led up one side. In the centre was a very large open space, and for the first time Sam noticed a pair of railroad tracks that led underneath the massive steel door. On the tracks sat an old steam engine, facing toward the door as if ready for a quick get away. The building was a large repair station for many Midwest rail lines. It didn’t look active to Sam.</p><p>Dean motioned for Sam to follow him as he slid against the wall and peered over a railing. Beneath was a basement. One side was open and the other was underneath the cement and steel floor. It allowed for about ten feet of space from the ceiling to the floor. Old steam engine parts had been pushed up against the walls and a long steel table had been placed in the middle of the basement structure. About fifty people milled about, crowding around something on the table. When the bodies parted, Sam caught a glimpse of the War Scroll laid out on the table.</p><p>A wooden door opened and Julia and Walter appeared. Dean’s eyes turned steely.</p><p>When Julia spoke, everyone quieted down.</p><p>“Thank you all for coming. First off, I’d like to say that I appreciate your sacrifice. And it will be a sacrifice, because as we go into this battle, despite our precautions, some of the people standing next to you may die. You may die. And though what we are embarking on is bloody, it is necessary. We are faced with the destruction of the Earth. To stop it there are actions that we as people, and as hunters, need to take. As you see, we have the last bit of the War Scroll, the sacred scroll written by the Essenes outlining the battle plan for the Sons of Light to overtake the Sons of Darkness.”</p><p>A murmur rose from the group.</p><p>“We were brought together decades ago for this express moment,” Julia continued. “Many of you knew my grandfather, and my grandfather knew your great grandfathers. We have waited for this moment for generations. And now it is here. We are all meant to play a part in defeating evil for the very last time. The Apocalypse we know will come. The Mayans weren’t far off; though the threat to end the world will come three years earlier than they thought. I unfortunately have intimate knowledge of this. But with this scroll we can stop it. What you see written behind the main text of the scroll is a list of names.”</p><p>All heads bowed once again to look at the scroll.</p><p>Up above, hiding in the darkness, Sam peered at his brother. Dean didn’t take his eyes off Julia as she moved around the room, almost military style. If she hadn’t been rousing people to murder, it might have been impressive.</p><p>“This is a list of names, each is a bloodline which will produce the vessels for the angels to fight Lucifer. We know that these bloodlines have been cultivated over 3,000 years by the angels, all for the impending fight with Lucifer. But, if the angels don’t have the vessels, there is no fight. Do not think of this task as extinguishing a heavenly light in this world. That’s not what we are doing. We are preventing that from happening. We are preventing the greatest fight man will ever know. We will be saving a billion lives.”</p><p>Dean watched Julia as she handed out a list of names to each hunter.</p><p>“On these pieces of paper there is a list of about fifty names, all are within your specific regions. Pass them to everyone you are working with. My father and I have already started and we have the name of Lucifer’s vessel and intend to take the appropriate action. Be careful, crafty. Dip into the funds if you need to hire someone in your stead. Do it quickly to avoid prolonged hysteria. We would like to extinguish these bloodlines by the end of the month. That gives you about ten days.</p><p>“Go out there and do this for the love of man. Good luck.”</p><p>One hunter pounded the butt of his shotgun on the table. Then another and another. The sound was a somber drum beat of death echoing through the large building. Then silence. Maps were laid out on the table. The people split into groups and the planning began.</p><p>As Julia spoke to a tall older man, she looked up into the darkness of the building, almost directly at Dean. Dean’s breath caught in his throat. Julia’s face registered a half second of recognition and then she looked back to the man in front of her.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” Dean whispered.</p><p>“We’re just going to let them do this?” Sam asked.</p><p>That’s when Dean heard it; it was far off in the distance, but the sound was unmistakable. It was the chugging of a train. The tracks below the brothers started to shake. Dean looked around—there wasn’t a Devil’s Trap to be found. How could Julia be so stupid?</p><p>Downstairs, the group fell silent, then en mass they grabbed their guns and ran up the staircase like battalions exiting u-boats.</p><p>“Turn on the lights!” someone called.</p><p>There was the clunk of a large switch being flipped and all the lights flickered on. That’s when Julia spotted Dean and Sam standing above her. Dean’s eyes met hers; Julia’s immediately welled with tears.</p><p>Outside, the engine had reached the outer edge of the train yard. It flew through the chain link fence, flinging cars out of the way like falling dominos.</p><p>The engine crashed into the steel door with such force that a six-foot-high span of bricks above the door cracked and fell to the ground. The door folded in half like an envelope. The hiss of the engine blew steam into the rafters forty feet above.</p><p>A silhouette appeared at the top of the engine.</p><p>Dean whispered, “Eisheth.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-30">CHAPTER 30</span><a href="#chapter-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>70 A.D. Khirbet Qumran, West Bank</p><p>The evening wind blowing in over the Dead Sea was, appropriately, as cold as death. Eisheth detested it, it whipped open the tents, and sand would kick up and cut into faces like glass, sending humans running for cover. She just about detested everything about life on Earth. After what she had seen, no one could blame her. Within the Lord’s Kingdom there was no bad weather, no wanting for food—and there certainly were no foul-smelling goats. Which wasn’t the case when living amongst the Essenes.</p><p>Her host was a girl of only eight years. At that age, children naturally demonstrate enough idiosyncratic behavior that no one noticed a little bit of demonic possession. That’s one positive thing about my new life, Eisheth thought, no more begging and pleading with vessels. “Please, it’s for the greater good,” she used to say. “It’s God’s Will. Say ‘Yes.’” The life of an angel required constantly asking for consent, and constant capitulation to the whims of others.</p><p>Demons didn’t have to ask. They took what they wanted, when they wanted it, used it up, and left what remained to rot. It suited her personality so much better.</p><p>Yet, what Eisheth wanted most, simple as it was, she could not take.</p><p>Sick of the biting gale, for after all she was in a human body and hated when it was uncomfortable, she sought shelter within one of the many canvas-walled tents that made up the majority of the settlement. The colony was substantial, but dwindling. Thousands of people, mostly men, gathered here to celebrate their shared faith... that unfortunately required them to remain celibate. How they intended to keep their faith alive into the next generation, Eisheth wasn’t sure. Her “father” had settled here after his wife died in childbirth, believing her death was his punishment for selfishly valuing his own pleasure over his God. Humans.</p><p>Inside the tent, Abaddon was already waiting.</p><p>“I don’t have long,” he said.</p><p>It took all of Eisheth’s considerable willpower to maintain her composure.</p><p>“Did he send word?” she asked. Abaddon avoided her gaze. “Of course. The Morning Star sends his deep affection...”</p><p>Not his love, she thought.</p><p>“... and wishes to know what you’ve found.”</p><p>Eisheth nodded, her cracked lips quivering.</p><p>“The prophet finishes his work as we speak.”</p><p>One half of Abaddon’s face pulled into a smile, while the other remained eerily blank.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>Prophecy was laborious and frustrating, coming in fits and starts, with no set schedule and no guarantee that the results would make sense. Eisheth hated being here among the zealots of the day. Despite that, she had dutifully watched the group... for him. Finally, one of the men she was particularly close to had written something of interest. She had immediately called Abaddon.</p><p>Abaddon and Eisheth entered the cave slowly, their human eyes adjusting to the dim surroundings. The prophet sat with his back against the rock wall, a small fire burnt to embers in front of him. At his side, a set of clay jars waited to be filled and sealed.</p><p>Fear flitted across the prophet’s face as Abaddon approached.</p><p>“Who... who...” he stuttered.</p><p>Without a word, Abaddon reached out and touched the man’s forehead. He collapsed to the ground with a dull thud, his mind wiped completely of a year’s work.</p><p>“I can’t stand small talk.” Abaddon picked up the completed scroll, admiring the intricate lettering. “We should use him more often—beautiful penmanship.”</p><p>“What now?” Eisheth asked, looking for her reward. “He’s happy with what I found, isn’t he?”</p><p>Abaddon moved to pick up one of the clay jars, hefting it and feeling its weight, then putting it back down.</p><p>“Oh, very. Tickled,” he said as he clapped his hands together. For a moment, nothing happened. He looked around the cave, surprised, apparently waiting for something to appear. Once again, he clapped loudly.</p><p>From outside, a low rumble filled the air, reverberating around the cave walls and shaking loose dirt from the ceiling. A swell of black smoke surged in through the cave’s opening, dancing through the air before finding its way to one of the clay jars.</p><p>“Who was that?” Eisheth asked as Abaddon placed the lid on the jar, sealing the demon inside. “Anyone I know?”</p><p>“An insurance policy,” Abaddon responded. “Something to help you find your way.”</p><p>“My way?” she asked.</p><p>“Do you remember Lilith’s hobby?” Abaddon asked with a dark grin, clearly aware that Lilith’s name would provoke a strong response from Eisheth.</p><p>“How could I forget,” she replied, memories of Lilith’s pet fresh in her mind. It was one of many lines that Lilith had crossed that Eisheth was unwilling to. Torturing an animal, twisting it into something unnatural, for no reason other than her own amusement. “The dog.” She hated the dog.</p><p>“I love that dog,” Abaddon said.</p><p>“So does Lilith. Why would she give him up?”</p><p>“Because he asked her to.”</p><p>Eisheth swallowed reflexively.</p><p>“He knew you’d need it.”</p><p>The pieces weren’t connecting for Eisheth. She had read the prophecy, though she didn’t fully understand the text. She knew that the battle it described was thousands of years in the future. What she didn’t know was the role that she was destined to play.</p><p>“I want to see him,” she said, desperation seeping into her voice. It had been years. How many, she didn’t know. It felt like thousands. “I need to see him.”</p><p>“I’m afraid you have a different destiny.”</p><p>Words had never had a more sinister edge. Eisheth backed away from Abaddon as he lifted the lid from another jar. His finger circled the rim, searing an Enochian sigil into the clay. Eisheth recognized the angelic script instantly. It reminded her of home—her first home. Heaven. Looking at Abbandon, this was beginning to feel like a terrible mistake.</p><p>Perhaps wholly trusting Abaddon wasn’t a wise move, he was a fallen angel after all. They were crafty, not single-minded like herself, a demon. Perhaps she shouldn’t have had her lust move her feet into blind submission to Abaddon’s direction.</p><p>In that moment, she pondered the extent of God’s forgiveness. If he could forgive humans for their vanity, their cruelty and their lust, surely he could forgive her. Surely love wasn’t so abhorrent a sin—</p><p>The thought ended there with a flick of Abaddon’s wrist. Eisheth’s soul, blackened by its union to Lucifer, jetted out of the young girl’s mouth in terrible, choking spasms.</p><p>Husband, why have you forsaken me?</p><p>She wouldn’t get her answer for nearly 2,000 years.</p><p>1954 A.D., St. Louis, Missouri</p><p>Didn’t see that coming, Dean thought.</p><p>Standing atop the engine, the demon’s eyes flared crimson—it was as if the blood pumping in her host’s veins was visible through her pupils.</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a harried glance, both understanding that any chance of peacefully defusing the situation had perished with the arrival of Eisheth and her horde.</p><p>From within the train, her demonic followers began to appear. First, a pair from the conductor’s hatch, clambering out and over the twisted steel that once was the building’s door. Next, a bald-headed man leapt with inhuman agility out of one of the cargo compartments. A veritable flood followed them—Dean counted about a hundred demons, every one of them moving into position around the assembled hunters. Reflected light from the glowing fire glimmered in their ebony eyes.</p><p>“Everybody stay back,” Dean shouted, trying his best to take command of the situation before someone tipped its delicate balance. His thoughts flipped quickly between regret—for having created the quagmire in the first place— and anger, directed squarely at Julia and Walter for fanning the flames.</p><p>To Dean’s chagrin, Walter shoved his way through the crowd of hunters and stood before Eisheth.</p><p>“You don’t know what you’ve walked into, demon,” he called out to her.</p><p>Chuckling, Eisheth squinted at Walter.</p><p>“Aren’t you a sad little creature,” she cackled. “Puffing out your chest like a man.”</p><p>If he was offended by the jab, Walter didn’t show it.</p><p>“Seems to me, this is about the worst place you could find yourself. Going head to head with the only people on this Earth who know how to kill you.”</p><p>Behind him, over a dozen of his compatriots formed into a rough phalanx, preparing for the inevitable fight.</p><p>With a look to her followers, Eisheth indicated for them to move forward.</p><p>“I am willing to find an equitable arrangement,” she said. “Give me the scroll, and we’ll only kill...” She trailed off, scanning the crowd, finally pointing a threatening finger at Julia. “Her.”</p><p>Dean bristled, and jostled his way through the crowd to stand next to Walter.</p><p>“Listen, bitch, we’ve heard about enough from you,” he growled.</p><p>Sam followed him out of the throng, taking up a defensive position next to his brother. Walter noticed and immediately stepped away from him. Julia must have told him everything, Dean realized. Of course, by now he’s had time to translate the entire list, so he could have found out about us on his own.</p><p>“Samuel Winchester,” Eisheth snarled. “I thought you, of all people, would understand what a mistake this is. Do you honestly believe you’ll be allowed to succeed?”</p><p>“We’re not afraid of you,” Walter said. His eyes shifted nervously between her and Sam, betraying the bravado in his words.</p><p>Eisheth ignored him, and continued to address Sam.</p><p>“As if your name isn’t on that list. Do you really think the angels will let you destroy their entire stock of vessels?”</p><p>Sam remained silent. Now it was Julia who stepped forward.</p><p>“We don’t give a damn what you or the angels think,” she said. “This is our planet, and we’re not going to let you destroy it.”</p><p>“Samuel. I’m speaking to you.” Eisheth glared at him. “Not the riff-raff.”</p><p>Behind Sam, Walter nodded toward several of the hunters. They pointed their rifles at Sam. Another set raised theirs toward Eisheth and her horde.</p><p>“Ah. I see. We have ourselves a little intraspecies squabble.” Eisheth smiled at Sam. “And you were such fast friends the last time we saw each other. What happened? Somebody find out your little secret?”</p><p>She addressed the group. “You really should be bowing before him, not pointing guns at his back. Do you realize how perfect a specimen he is? Do you know what kind of strength it takes to house an archangel?”</p><p>“He’s a freak,” Walter declared. “Just like you. Now why don’t you take your little circus and leave town? Can’t promise not to catch up with you, but I’ll give you a head start.”</p><p>“Things sure have changed since I was bottled up,” Eisheth said. “2,000 years ago, people had so much faith that they refused to marry. Thought it would take up too much of their prayer time. Now look at you.”</p><p>“You want to talk about faith?” Walter cried furiously. “You’re a monster! A blight on God’s creation.”</p><p>“If you cared about God’s creation, you’d let Him do with it as He wished. If He wants to take His ball and go home, let Him. Except in this case, He wants to smash His ball to pieces.”</p><p>“He wants me to save it,” Walter said with fervor.</p><p>“Please,” Eisheth said exasperated. “You? Look at you! You think you’re important enough to be part of God’s plan?”</p><p>Blood rushed to Walter’s face. Dean could see the fury in his eyes, every taunt bringing him closer to breaking point.</p><p>“Enough!” Sam shouted, stepping between Eisheth and Walter. “Walter, you think you’ve figured out what part you have to play, but trust me, you don’t want to play a part. It’s hell. And it’s not fair. I don’t want anything to do with Lucifer, and I’m going to do my damnedest to avoid it, but those are the cards I was dealt. Maybe the cards you got let you sit this one out. Maybe you have something else to do with your life, besides throwing it away trying to stop the inevitable.”</p><p>Dean shot Sam a look. Inevitable? What was he saying? That he knew he’d have to say yes to Satan eventually?</p><p>“Glad you’ve accepted that, Sam,” Eisheth stated.</p><p>She stepped off the roof of the train engine and dropped, landing with a thud on the cracked flooring.</p><p>“If you wish it... I will spare them.”</p><p>Sam and Dean both recoiled in shock. What did that crazy broad just say?</p><p>“In exchange for one thing.”</p><p>Of course, Dean thought. Of course there’s a catch.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, Sam said quietly, “What?”</p><p>“When the time comes, and Lucifer is finally freed... I want you to kill Lilith. Before you say yes to Lucifer, considering you won’t have much of a say in things after that.”</p><p>Sam’s face went slack. Was she serious? Did she really not know?</p><p>Shaking his head, Sam backed away from her.</p><p>“No. I—I can’t.”</p><p>Eisheth fumed. “Fine. Don’t say I didn’t give you a choice.”</p><p>She held up her hand, getting the attention of the demons around her. Then she brought her hand down, toward Walter and Julia’s army.</p><p>“Wait! Sam. Sammy,” Dean cried out. “You can reconsider, right? Seems like killing Lilith might be something you’re into.” He shot Sam a big-eyed look, hoping that his little brother would realize how stupid he was being. Lie to her, dumbass! Give Walter and Julia a chance to tuck their tails between their legs and run, then we can deal with this the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Eisheth motioned to her demons, stopping them, and waited for Sam to respond.</p><p>“Why do you care?” Dean asked, trying to draw her out while he figured out a plan.</p><p>“Guess my story didn’t make it into your copy of the Bible,” she barked angrily. “I was an angel. I was supposed to be up there, among the Heavenly Host, deciding all of your pathetic little fates. But I made one mistake. Loved an angel I wasn’t supposed to, and look where it got me.” She indicated the pack of fiends behind her. “Lilith, a damned human, comes in and pushes me out, so I ripped out my grace and became human for him, too. But even that wasn’t enough. It was as if Lucifer only had space in Hell for one of us.”</p><p>“Sounds like Lucifer’s not your biggest fan then, if he let that happen,” Dean said.</p><p>His words caused Eisheth’s jaw to grind. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. She did what humans do. She manipulated, schemed, and back-stabbed until she had the support of his... caretaker.” She paused, then added, without much conviction, “Lucifer never stopped loving me.”</p><p>“I bet.”</p><p>“When this was discovered, it was I who brought it to Abaddon’s attention,” she said, pointing at the list which was still laid out on the table, “because I was the better wife. More loyal than Lilith. I gave everything up for him. I told Abaddon that.”</p><p>“Wait, Abaddon?” Dean said, his head reeling. How could that be true? Who was Abaddon loyal to—Heaven or Hell?</p><p>Eisheth smiled cruelly. “You know him?”</p><p>Dean looked at the floor, considering the options. One: she was lying. She was a demon, after all. Two: Abaddon was a spy infiltrating the bad camp 2,000 years ago, and that’s how he knew Eisheth. Three: Abaddon was bad and always had been, or his true motives were too complicated for Dean to ever figure out, and he was best left going with his gut, which at this juncture was telling him to kill Eisheth and run.</p><p>“You’d remember him if you’d met him. He’s not exactly a charmer.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that,” Sam interjected. “But what does he have to do with the scroll?”</p><p>“Look who’s chatty now,” Eisheth said. “Abaddon was the one that told me I would be in Lucifer’s favor for showing him the scrolls. He was the only link I had to a very absent husband. And he’s the bastard who sealed me in the jar.”</p><p>Sam and Dean shared a wary look. At the moment, they were facing a firing squad on one side, a bitter old demon and her lackeys on another, and if they ever found their way home, an angel gone bad would be waiting for them. So, it was a lot like any other day.</p><p>“I spent 2,000 years in that damn jar, puzzling over what it all meant, why my husband would let that happen. And I think I’ve figured it out.”</p><p>“Yeah? What’s that?” Dean said. As Eisheth related her story, he was busy scanning the room for something that would give them an advantage. But as he currently saw it, there were over a hundred demons, and just over fifty hunters. The hunters had guns, the demons were almost impossible to kill. If Eisheth was anywhere near as powerful as Lilith, the advantage was certainly on her side.</p><p>“The task I’ve been given, it’s a test. I stop you, and I’ve proven my worth. Lucifer wants nothing more than to have a fight. I’m here to make sure he gets it. The vessels must be preserved.”</p><p>“After all he put you through, you’re still doing his chores?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I love him.” It seemed that to Eisheth, it was as simple as that. No matter what had happened to her, what she had been forced into, her mind was made up.</p><p>“This is insane,” Dean said with vitriol. “We’re talking about thousands of lives. It’s not a test; it’s not a special destiny. It’s about right and wrong, and damn if the demon isn’t right this time. I have no intention of letting Michael and Lucifer fight it out, not with the whole world hanging in the balance, but I’m not going to give up on doing the right thing just to take the easy way out. There’s an easy fix for all of us. Walk the hell away—“</p><p>Before Eisheth could respond, Walter stepped forward and placed a rock salt shotgun firmly to her temple.</p><p>“Dad! No!” Julia cried out, rushing toward her father, but it was too late. In a blur of motion, Eisheth slammed her fist into his ribcage, instantly shattering it. He reeled from the blow, his shotgun blasting uselessly into the air as the demon dove at him, gripping him firmly by the neck.</p><p>With a sickening crack, she ended his life. His body went limp and she let it drop to the floor. For all his talk about destiny, Walter had ended up deciding his own fate.</p><p>“Kill them all. Except for Samuel.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-31">CHAPTER 31</span><a href="#chapter-31" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean fired a round of bullets at the surrounding demons, creating a haze of smoke and salt. Bodies keeled over. Sam slashed a couple with Ruby’s knife. The demons’ wounds flashed a hellfire orange as they were dispatched into nothingness.</p><p>While Eisheth was distracted, Dean ran to Walter’s body. Figuring the old man would not have let go of those precious last pages of the scroll, he patted him down and sure enough found them in his breast pocket.</p><p>“Sorry old man. I hope it was worth it,” he said, carefully pulling out the papers and pocketing them.</p><p>The fight raged around him, the air filled with shotgun blasts and the screams of hunters as the demons overcame them. The hunters were fighting back but there were just too many demons. It’s a massacre, Dean thought, and there’s nothing we can do to save them.</p><p>Through the chaos he spied Julia. In a rage of grief she was drop-kicking, stabbing and shooting at demons from all sides, but they were closing in. Fighting his way through the maelstrom, Dean grabbed hold of her. She struggled against him as he pulled her down the steel staircase to the room underneath the engine work floor.</p><p>Sam stood at the bottom of the staircase and shot rounds of salt over their heads.</p><p>Eisheth turned back around and saw Dean disappear down the staircase.</p><p>“Come on Winchesters,” she cried, standing tall and bloody amongst the dead and dying hunters, surrounded by her horde. “I just want to talk.”</p><p>They barricaded themselves in an ante-room which led off the basement.</p><p>“So now what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Is there another way out of here?” Dean asked Julia, who stood immobile, staring at the floor.</p><p>He grasped her by the shoulders.</p><p>“Julia! Is there another way out of here?”</p><p>She looked up. “I killed him.”</p><p>“No, you didn’t. Walter died for what he believed in. No one was going to convince him otherwise, not even you. Now we have to find a way out of here.”</p><p>Dean looked around the room. “What is this place?”</p><p>Crates and sacks were stacked up against every wall of the rectangular room. A distinct pungent odor hung in the air. The only fresh ventilation was coming through a large grate in the ceiling.</p><p>Dean pried open a crate and looked inside. Dynamite.</p><p>“That explains the reinforced steel door,” Sam said, looking over his shoulder. “I bet this was used as some sort of hub when they built the Atlantic Pacific Railroad. They’d need explosives to grade earth and create suitable terrain for the rail lines.”</p><p>“Now I feel bad about taking away your Thomas the Train toy.” Dean glanced witheringly at his brother. “This stuff must be like seventy years old. Do you think it still works?”</p><p>There was a loud bang at the door, then another. The demons were trying to get in. Each impact dented the steel a bit more. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>“We’re not going to have time to find out,” Sam said, guarding the door. “Let’s get these things unpacked.”</p><p>Minutes later the trio were hard at work. Julia was stringing detonation wire between the crates of dynamite, and Sam and Dean were ripping open all the various sacks of chemicals and gunpowder. By the time they were done they were knee deep in explosives.</p><p>The demons continued to work on the steel door, it was beginning to tear like tin foil.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” Dean said, unscrewing the bolts on the ventilation shaft.</p><p>A faint scratching sound could be heard coming from above.</p><p>“Did they get inside there? That’s our only way out,” Julia said nervously, looking up into the darkness between the metal slats.</p><p>“We’ve got no choice now. I’ll go first. Julia second. Sam, you cover the back and lay the wire as we go.”</p><p>Dean stood on a chair and lifted himself into the vent. He pulled Julia up behind him. Sam managed to bury the denotation wire in the explosives below. The demons were almost all the way through the door when Sam lifted himself up into the shaft and hastily put the grid back on it.</p><p>They crawled through the ventilation shaft on their hands and knees. It ran underneath the engine work floor and every twenty feet or so it changed direction. They soon felt like they were going in circles.</p><p>“Are you sure you know where this is going?” Julia asked.</p><p>“It has to lead somewhere,” Dean said. The enclosed box shape of the duct-work made Dean uneasy, it reminded him of being stuck in a coffin after his death. “This is so not good for my claustrophobia.”</p><p>Sam was bringing up the rear, sliding his shotgun in front of him and then crawling up to meet it. The action made a lulling swish-swish sound. But then he heard the distinct screech of metal scraping against metal.</p><p>“Dean, I think you need to speed it up a bit,” Sam called ahead.</p><p>“I’m going as fast as I can.”</p><p>“I think they just got into the vent.”</p><p>“Damn it.”</p><p>“Hurry!” Sam called. He could hear the demons getting closer.</p><p>Sam took the right turn behind Julia, but his leg wouldn’t move. He looked back. A demon, a man in overalls, smiled a toothless grin at him.</p><p>“Where you goin’ pretty boy?”</p><p>Sam flipped onto his back and shot the man between the eyes in one motion. The salt pellet burned into the demon’s head. Smoke escaped from his mouth, sped across the top of the ventilation shaft and disappeared out of the grate.</p><p>“Dean, we need to get out of here!”</p><p>Dean slid underneath the grating that led to the outside. He crouched down then pushed it with his back. It wouldn’t budge.</p><p>“It’s stuck!”</p><p>“I have a whole load of demons on my ass. Figure something out!”</p><p>Dean pushed again. The grate gave a bit, then a little more. He scrambled up and disappeared outside.</p><p>Another demon quickly crawled toward Sam. He spun and shot it in the heart.</p><p>Julia clambered out of the grate ahead of Sam.</p><p>Sam managed to follow her, squeezing through the opening just as more demonic black eyes appeared out of the darkness.</p><p>He found himself standing on a grassy patch about fifty yards away from the engine warehouse.</p><p>Dean started shooting salt rounds into the hole Sam had just vacated. He yelled at Julia over his shoulder.</p><p>“Get that car over here.” He pointed at a car parked on the street twenty feet away.</p><p>“Let’s get the grate back over it,” Sam said, indicating the hole.</p><p>They pulled the iron grate onto the hole just as three more demonic faces appeared below them.</p><p>“Suck it, bitches.” Dean smiled.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s going to hold,” Sam said.</p><p>An engine roared. From behind the wheel of the car, Julia motioned for them to get out of the way. She stopped directly over the grate. They could see the demons trying to push the grate open, but it would only move so far up against the undercarriage of the automobile.</p><p>Sam pulled the detonation wire about ten feet from the car.</p><p>“Find some cover,” Dean called to Julia.</p><p>Julia exited the car and took cover behind another car parked on the dark street.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. “Let’s hope this works.”</p><p>Sam lit the detonation wire. It sparked, then fizzled out.</p><p>“Aww, come on! Let me try.” Dean took the Zippo from his younger brother and tried lighting the wire, but it refused to ignite.</p><p>“It’s too old,” Dean said. “Eisheth’s still in there. Let’s light that bitch up.”</p><p>“Someone has to go in and light it some other way. I’ll do it,” Sam said.</p><p>“Sam, no. No telling what Eisheth will do to you if she catches you.”</p><p>“Let me do it. I started this.”</p><p>“It’s a suicide mission.”</p><p>“It’s not like that. We need to kill Eisheth, she’s leading the charge in there. Those poor possessed people are already dead. We need to put them out of their misery.”</p><p>Dean nodded his head, his brother was right.</p><p>Sam took the Zippo from Dean.</p><p>“Wish me luck.”</p><p>He ran off toward the warehouse.</p><p>Sam peeked through a dusty window—the warehouse was crawling with demons. Eisheth had somehow recruited yet more. The bodies of the hunters were littered across the floor, not one of them was still standing. Poor people, Sam thought, all of them thought they were on their way to fulfilling some sort of destiny, and they all died today. Because of me.</p><p>Sam kicked open the window and climbed inside. He stealthily made his way to the steel staircase. The basement was full of demons all still fighting to get into the anteroom where they had been holed up. Sam looked around for something to light. He saw an old piece of rope and an empty beer bottle. Sam took some oil from a can and poured it into the beer bottle, then he dipped the rope into the oil and shoved that into the top of the bottle.</p><p>“I was hoping we would get a little one-on-one time,” a voice said.</p><p>Sam spun around to see Eisheth leaning suggestively against the dead body of a hunter splayed over a piece of machinery. She smiled and sauntered toward him.</p><p>“I have to say, Lucifer did well. He always had good taste. You’ll soon find that out.” Eisheth reached her hand up to touch Sam’s face. “We are going to have such fun together.”</p><p>Sam pulled away. “You disgust me. You should’ve stayed in your genie bottle.”</p><p>“Oh, come now, Sam. Aren’t you even a little bit happy to see me? I’m happy to see you. I was cooped up for so long in that jar. I had plenty of time to fantasize about what vessel Lucifer would pick for himself when he rose. And, my oh my, I am glad it’s someone so tall. You know... when Lilith wasn’t around,” Eisheth pressed up close to Sam, “Lucifer and I did some wonderful things together. Would you like me to show you?”</p><p>She trailed her fingers over Sam’s chest and down toward his belt buckle.</p><p>“Maybe in my next lifetime.”</p><p>Eisheth laughed. “You are a comedian, aren’t you? Don’t you understand? I’m your future wife. Maybe not in this body, but I’ll make sure she’s really nice and young. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? In fifty years, when Lucifer is out and inside you... Well, let’s just say I can’t wait to get back to playing our old games.”</p><p>Eisheth leaned in to kiss Sam. Sam took a step, spun around and simultaneously lit and threw the bottle into the basement and right at the ante-room door. A couple of demons were blown apart in the quick flare up. It would only be a matter of time before the entire room went up.</p><p>Eisheth grabbed Sam by the neck, and threw him up against a wall.</p><p>“You think I care about a hundred lesser demons? Burn them all. I just care about you, Samuel. I want you to be safe.”</p><p>Sam pushed himself up and lunged at Eisheth. With the demon knife, he slashed at her belly. She moved away with a quick step.</p><p>“Silly boy, you can’t kill me. I’m over 2,000 years old.”</p><p>Eisheth threw up her hand and Sam went flying fifty feet through the air, landing at the base of the steam engine. His head cracked against the iron.</p><p>“Now look what you made me do. I didn’t want to hurt this perfect specimen.”</p><p>Eisheth strode toward him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-32">CHAPTER 32</span><a href="#chapter-32" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What’s taking him so long?” Dean asked.</p><p>Dean and Julia were hidden behind a car, waiting for the four-story brick building to blow.</p><p>Without warning, the windows blew out, and hot mercury-colored glass shot in all directions.</p><p>There was a rumble, and then another blast as more fire exploded from the windows and roof of the building. Its seven-story smoke stack started to sway. There were a series of smaller percussions which rattled windows in the surrounding buildings. Then everything was silent for a moment.</p><p>A sizzling noise came from within the damaged structure, like a thousand tons of bacon frying. A blast like a mini atom bomb shot up into the air, crumbling the fifty-foot walls and sending flaming debris a hundred yards in all directions.</p><p>Dean looked at the destroyed shell of foundation.</p><p>“Sam?” he said in a small voice.</p><p>Then, against the light of the burning inferno, a silhouette appeared. Sam? The figure gradually revealed itself to be Eisheth. She strode up to them, dragging Sam’s body behind her.</p><p>Dean leveled his shotgun at her.</p><p>“He’s not dead, don’t worry. I’m as upset as you are. His body is so magnificent. I told him I can’t wait until I get to explore it all over.”</p><p>“Put him down,” Dean commanded.</p><p>Eisheth dropped Sam face first onto the gravel.</p><p>“What would you like to do now? I did my job. I stopped all those holier-than-thou hunters from killing the vessels.”</p><p>“You killed my father!” Julia shouted.</p><p>Eisheth regarded Dean with a smirk.</p><p>“Really, this whiney little mouse is attractive to you? Okay, listen sweetheart, I had a job to do. I had to stop all you blood-filled air suckers from thinking you are doing God’s work. If you only knew. From my perspective, God created a hot, dry, dusty, famine-filled world for you. Why would you ever want to help his cause?”</p><p>“Hey, Sigourney, can you stop playing Gate Keeper for a moment, and let’s get this over with,” Dean shouted over the roar of the fire.</p><p>“Just one more thing, then I’ll get out of your hair. I need the last pages of the scroll. My job is to protect those names, and I’m not letting anyone else get any crazy ideas about killing off the vessels, especially now I’ve met my husband’s. I’m talking to you, mouse.”</p><p>Julia stepped out from behind the car and leveled her gun at Eisheth. A lightning quick unseen force pulled Julia toward Eisheth. She flew through the air and landed unconscious at Eisheth’s feet. The demon knelt down and picked her up by the hair, examining her face.</p><p>“Nice face, but a little petite, don’t you think? Oh, and by the way, thanks for this. It’s like a token from my homeland. Makes me nostalgic for all those sacrifices people used to do.”</p><p>Eisheth held the demon knife at Julia’s throat.</p><p>“I know. She’s definitely not like me, but she will bleed regardless. I’m going to have so much fun with this knife. Do you know what I’m going to be able to do with it?” Eisheth dropped Julia and began ranting and gesticulating with the knife like it was a piece of chalk held by a professor. “I can kill off all Lucifer’s precious little demons. I’ll be able to slaughter each and every one. Then he’ll have to listen to me.”</p><p>Dean had to think fast.</p><p>“What’s your plan?” he said. “You reckon killing demons is going to make your absent husband take you more seriously? You can boil little bunnies Glenn Close-style all you want, Lucifer has bigger fish to fry. You’re just a distraction to him. Second fiddle. He’s Tiger Woods and you’re just another cocktail waitress to text message.”</p><p>“Are those the last words your true love is going to hear you say?” Eisheth spat. “Fine with me.”</p><p>Grabbing her hair, Eisheth lifted Julia’s body off the ground. She pushed her neck back and held the knife to her throat again.</p><p>“What if we could make you a deal?” Dean asked, eyeing the glinting blade as she pressed it to Julia’s skin.</p><p>“What could you possibly have that I would have the slightest bit of interest in?”</p><p>“We can take you to Lucifer. Now. You won’t have to wait.”</p><p>That made Eisheth pause.</p><p>“It seems like you haven’t had a face-to-face with your hubby in a long time. Maybe now is the time to try to get into couples therapy?”</p><p>“I don’t like the way you talk.”</p><p>“You’re a smart chick. Despite those 2,000 birthday candles on your cake, I know you get it.” Dean smirked.</p><p>“Someone broke the seals?” Eisheth asked.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. Seemed everyone thought it was impossible.</p><p>“Someone broke the seals. Lilith did, to be exact, and she’s gone.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes glowed brightly, the thought of her husband unfettered, free of his favorite wife, was the consolation and redemption she had been waiting for.</p><p>Dean needed to rope her in quick.</p><p>“Lucifer is walking around just like you and me. But there’s a catch— it’s fifty-six years in the future. But we have a way to get you there.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“All things come to those who wait. You need to do something for us first.”</p><p>“I don’t do favors.”</p><p>Dean looked at her steadily. “You’ll do this one. Just let Julia go.”</p><p>Eisheth looked down at Julia’s limp body.</p><p>“Fine,” she said, dropping her to the ground. “What do I have to do?”</p><p>“First things first, we have a couple of stops.”</p><p>“Where’d you say you found me?” Leanne Keeny asked.</p><p>“Wandering around St. Louis. You don’t remember anything?” Dean shot her a sideways glance as he negotiated the country dirt road.</p><p>“I thought I went to New York. I got a job, I think. It was my first day. That’s the last thing I remember.”</p><p>“You’re a lucky girl. Is this it?” Dean turned the car up a long driveway leading to a white clapboard farmhouse. “Nice place. I’m sure your parents will be happy to see you.”</p><p>“They weren’t expecting me until Christmas.”</p><p>“Leanne, do me a favor. Stay here on the farm. Raise a family. You don’t need to go to New York to have a good life.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Guess you’re right. Besides, New York was awfully expensive.”</p><p>“There you go. Smart girl.”</p><p>Leanne flashed him a big smile as she got out of the car. She shut the door and leaned in through the open window.</p><p>“So,” she hesitated, “maybe you and me could go get a float sometime.”</p><p>“Sorry sweetheart, I’m not the settling-down type.” Dean winked, put the car into reverse and peeled off down the driveway.</p><p>Leanne Keeny took a long look at her parents’ farmhouse and then ran inside.</p><p>Hours later, Dean pulled into the Twin Pines Motel in Waubay. He parked the car. Julia appeared in the doorway of a cabin. Dean couldn’t take his eyes off her.</p><p>“Where’s Sam?” he asked as he shut the car door.</p><p>“He’s in a cabin. Sleeping, of all things. Are you sure about all this?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “I’m never sure about anything. But we had to take the risk. Besides, she had a knife to your throat.”</p><p>“Thank you for saving my life.” Julia looked up into Dean’s eyes.</p><p>He put his arms around her waist and gently pushed her into the cabin, closing the door behind him with his foot.</p><p>Dean gently slid onto the bed, pulling Julia with him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry for everything,” Julia said as she smoothed her hands over Dean’s chest. “Everything I believed in, everyone I’ve ever known... is gone.”</p><p>Dean gazed into her eyes for a moment. It was true that Julia’s life was forever changed. She had lost her father, all of the hunters who were her friends; she had lost her way of life. Dean thought about how hard it would be to go back to living a normal existence. Would there always be an itching to be on the road? Dean didn’t know any other life. But Julia, she was different.</p><p>“You’re free, Julia. You’re now free to do what you want.”</p><p>Julia pulled back to look at him. “What I want is to be with you.”</p><p>“That can’t happen. You know that.”</p><p>Julia nodded sadly and laid her head on Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>In the early dawn, Dean woke up. As quietly as possible, he crept out of bed, gathered his clothing up off the floor, lingered a moment at the door, then left.</p><p>He walked into the other cabin, where Sam was apparently still sleeping.</p><p>“You awake? We need to do this.”</p><p>Sam sat up in bed. He was already dressed. He nodded and followed Dean out into the parking lot. They walked west into a field by the motel. Dean took the last couple of pages of the War Scroll from inside his leather jacket. Holding them up by one corner, he lit his Zippo and the flame caught the parchment. In a matter of seconds the pages had curled up like black tongues licking up the fire.</p><p>As the last bit of the War Scroll disappeared into ash, there was a bright flash of light.</p><h2><span id="chapter-33">CHAPTER 33</span><a href="#chapter-33" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Castiel had told Dean many times about the difficulty of moving objects through time. How it exhausted him, and left him barely able to think, much less fight. Dean was beginning to learn, from first-hand experience, that it was also true for the traveler. As the 1954 world flashed out of existence around him, a deep, gurgling something bubbled up in his stomach. He mentally prepared himself for the possibility that he’d puke when they got back to 2010. God, I hope it comes up as puke, not out the other side.</p><p>When the world re-formed, Dean was no longer standing. He was sitting in the back booth of the Waubay bar, a cheeseburger and a freshly poured beer waiting on the table in front of him. Sam was seated next to him, uncomfortably close.</p><p>“You want to give me some breathing room?” Dean scooted sideways slightly.</p><p>Sam didn’t respond. He just tapped the glass in front of him, as if it wasn’t real.</p><p>“Hey, you want to sit on a guy’s lap, wait till Christmas,” Dean said.</p><p>Finally, Sam slid out of the booth and stood up, surveying the rest of the room.</p><p>“Do you see him?”</p><p>Dean looked around the bar. Don, or Abaddon, or whoever the hell he was, apparently hadn’t stuck around to greet them.</p><p>“Dude zapped us back. Gotta be around here somewhere.” Remembering their earlier encounter, Dean looked toward the back of the bar. “Check the bathroom. Guy has a woman’s bladder. Then we’ll check outside.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the bathroom’s only occupant was a large Peruvian man, who incidentally did not like having his privacy invaded. Sam learned that lesson very quickly, much to Dean’s amusement.</p><p>As they left the bar, Dean saw something that nearly brought a tear to his eye. The Impala, in all its glory, rested under a nearby oak tree.</p><p>“Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” he said, running his fingers over the cool metal of the hood.</p><p>“Why are you stroking a car?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Give me a break, I haven’t seen her in weeks.”</p><p>“Her?”</p><p>Dean was distracted when he noticed a white spot on the windshield. That’s when it hit him —something was seriously wrong here.</p><p>“Didn’t park it here,” he said, mostly to himself.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I left the car at the motel. We... we got zapped back from the motel, not the bar. The Impala shouldn’t be here.”</p><p>He pointed at the white spot. “And when have I ever parked her under a tree, where birds can... do things on her?”</p><p>“Sorry about that, Dean. I moved it for you,” Abaddon’s voice called out from behind them. “Thought you’d appreciate a welcome home meal, rather than a stuffy motel room.”</p><p>“That’s awfully nice of you, Donny, but why don’t you cut the crap?”</p><p>Abaddon hung his head, as if in shame.</p><p>“Ah. So I take it your trip didn’t go well?”</p><p>“You know exactly how it went. You knew all along what we were going to find, and what we’d have to do when we found it.”</p><p>“You know, Dean, you really should let your baby bro get a word in edgewise sometimes. I think he’d really appreciate it.” Don looked amused.</p><p>Sam was apparently speechless with anger. His face had contorted in rage at the sight of Abaddon.</p><p>“See, he looks a little... piqued.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about him,” Dean said. “Worry about me, and what I’m going to do to you. What the angels are going to do to you when they find out you’ve been batting for the other side.”</p><p>“Oooooh. I’m scared.” Abaddon shielded his face in mock alarm. “Don’t tell Daddy on me. Oh wait, my dad’s dead. Gone to wherever omnipotent but lazy deities go when they finally get bored with their creations and abandon ship.”</p><p>“So what, now you kill us? Put us through the funhouse and then slit our throats when we find our way out?”</p><p>“Buddy, you’re not getting the lesson at all.”</p><p>“What can I say. I’m a drop-out.”</p><p>“That’s fine, since it’s not really for you to get, anyway. It’s for our good friend over here.” He nodded toward Sam.</p><p>“Tell me if you’ve heard this before: You’re going to say yes. And it’s not because you’ll be tricked, or because you’ll be forced. It’s because the other options don’t work. Not for you.”</p><p>“You don’t know all our options,” Dean retorted.</p><p>“I just gave you a great one. And what did you do? You went out of your way to keep things the way they are. You got your friend killed to save Lucifer.”</p><p>“We didn’t kill anybody.”</p><p>“Honestly, it’s a win-win for us either way,” Abaddon continued. “If you’d tried to kill all those vessels, you would have failed. You would have moped and felt terrible for trying, and we would have ended up in this exact same place, only you’d be one step closer to damnation. Like it or not, all three of us know that the fight is inevitable. And that’s why you did what you did.”</p><p>Sam could no longer hold his silence.</p><p>“You pretend that you thought of everything, that the outcome was determined before you set things in motion.”</p><p>Abaddon turned to Sam, a little disconcerted by his calm tone. And there was something else in his voice as well. Abaddon frowned slightly.</p><p>“But you’ve left a loose string,” Sam said. “You forgot about my destiny.”</p><p>“Your destiny... is with Lucifer.” Abaddon seemed suddenly uncertain.</p><p>Sam smiled broadly. It was so out of character in that moment that it even rattled Dean.</p><p>“That’s more true than you know,” Sam said. “And when I’m finally returned to him, I’ll be sure to tell him how easily you were fooled.” Sam’s eyes flashed red.</p><p>“Eisheth.” The truth hit Abaddon heavily. It looked as if the air had been pressed from his lungs.</p><p>Dean’s heart was racing. They had taken an awful risk, and so far it had paid off. With any luck, Abaddon had been weakened enough by transporting them to be an easy target for Eisheth. Whether Eisheth behaved herself in Sam’s body was another question.</p><p>“I’m going to make you suffer, Abaddon,” Eisheth said. “For at least 2,000 years.”</p><p>She flew at Abaddon, supernaturally propelled at an impossible speed. Bones crunched as they slammed against an oak tree. Abaddon was up in a flash, fiercely pounding Sam’s body with his fists.</p><p>“Careful with my brother,” Dean shouted from the sidelines.</p><p>Without looking up, Eisheth lifted Abaddon off his feet and threw him clear across the parking lot. He struck the metal dumpster outside the bar, crumpling its sides like an empty beer can.</p><p>The possibility that the fight would go on for hours was very real. Dean had no idea how powerful either creature was, but he knew the human bodies they wore would be destroyed long before the twisted souls within them. Alright, time to figure out an endgame.</p><p>As Abaddon lifted himself from the buckled dumpster, Dean made his move. He ran full-tilt toward the bar’s front door, swerving to avoid the scuffle. Abaddon landed a solid blow across Sam’s face just as Dean entered the bar.</p><p>“Phone. I—I need to use your phone.” Dean’s pale face and desperate tone were enough to convince the bartender to immediately grab the receiver from below the bar.</p><p>“It’s not long distance, is it?”</p><p>“Well, I’m calling Heaven...”</p><p>Thirty seconds later, Castiel picked up his cell phone. “Hello?”</p><p>“Cass. It’s Dean. I need your help. Right now.”</p><p>“Dean. Your absence has been... concerning me.”</p><p>“That’s great, man, I’m touched, but I need you to get your ass moving. Waubay, South Dakota. It’s the only bar in—“</p><p>Castiel appeared next to him. The bartender and his pack of regulars looked on in awe.</p><p>“—town.”</p><p>“Where’s Sam?” Castiel asked.</p><p>“Look outside,” Dean said. “I think we might need some backup.”</p><p>Within a minute, Cass had assembled a mixture of odds and ends he had found in the bar’s tiny kitchen. Herbs, a pile of toothpicks, and an assortment of other seemingly random ingredients that apparently formed a potent magical cocktail.</p><p>“You’re the MacGyver of magic, Cass.”</p><p>“I need blood,” Castiel said, as if he was asking Dean to pass him the salt.</p><p>“Whose?”</p><p>“Yours. That’s what will attract the angels. They’ll be looking for any sign of you.”</p><p>At that very moment something—or someone—was thrown against the side of the building, knocking knick-knacks off the walls. Dean took that as a sign. He grabbed a knife from behind the bar and opened a deep gash on his palm.</p><p>“A sigil,” Castiel said. “Quickly.”</p><p>Outside, Sam’s face was bloodied, his body bruised and beaten, and the fight was nowhere near over. Eisheth used Sam’s good left arm to smash Abaddon across the face, toppling him to the ground.</p><p>“I trusted you,” Eisheth said coldly. Sam’s fist pounded down against Abaddon’s cheek, sending blood spilling out of his mouth.</p><p>“You were never his favorite,” Abaddon hissed, barely able to move his lips. “You were no more than a pet. Why’d you think we put you—“</p><p>Eisheth punched him in the face again.</p><p>“—with the dog?” Abaddon cackled, blood pouring down his face and onto the dirt. A second later, his manic smile froze. He had seen something behind Sam that terrified him.</p><p>Eisheth turned and saw it as well. Five black specks dotted the otherwise clear sky. Within a heartbeat, they filled the heavens —five men, held aloft by invisible wings, fury in their eyes.</p><p>The angels descended on them in a flash, knocking Sam aside and plunging their heavenly daggers deep into Abaddon’s flesh. As he writhed in pain, Dean and Castiel rushed forward.</p><p>“Cass, get us out of here!” Dean cried as the angels turned from Abaddon to Sam.</p><p>Castiel and the closest angel were both speeding toward Sam. For Dean, time seemed to slow. If Cass didn’t reach him first, the angels would show Eisheth no mercy. Sam would die as collateral damage.</p><p>The next thing Dean knew, he was standing outside a greasy burger joint.</p><p>“What happened?” he asked, looking around.</p><p>Next to him, Sam stood, much the worse for wear, but alive. Castiel stood on his other side, having teleported them clear of the fight.</p><p>“Abaddon was destroyed. They’ll... Excuse me, but why is there a demon inside Sam?”</p><p>“It’s a long story, Cass.”</p><p>Castiel narrowed his eyes at Sam, studying him closely.</p><p>“Don’t. Don’t start anything. Just... let her go.”</p><p>Eisheth turned to Dean, surprised. “Let me go?”</p><p>“That was the deal. You save our asses, we save yours.”</p><p>“Dean, this is not just any demon,” Castiel said gravely.</p><p>“I know. And it could very well bite us in the ass. But that’s what’s happening.”</p><p>Five minutes later, they were sharing an odd farewell with Missy Fuller, former employee of Burger Junction, current bride of Satan.</p><p>It had been a strange few weeks.</p><p>Sam and Dean recounted their journey to Castiel over burgers. Sam noticed that Dean left out a lot of details, most of them concerning Julia.</p><p>That there had been a list of angelic vessels wasn’t news to Castiel. He’d heard rumors over the millennia that the list existed, but no one in Heaven had ever known its exact location.</p><p>“Except Abaddon,” Sam pointed out. He was still in considerable pain, despite Dean having patched him up and forced a cocktail of painkillers down his throat.</p><p>“His deception will have caught Heaven off guard. The angels are not going to blindly trust each other nearly as much as they once did.”</p><p>“So at least we’ve accomplished something,” Dean said with a touch of bitterness.</p><p>After eating their fill, Castiel helpfully teleported the Impala to the Burger Junction, then disappeared. He was off, once again, to try and find his absentee father. Sam and Dean both empathized.</p><p>As they climbed into the Impala, Dean frowned. “What do you think it’d be like? Having a home base like Walter and Julia did? Hunter HQ?”</p><p>“We’ve got Bobby. Besides, it didn’t work out very well for them.”</p><p>“I can’t shake this feeling... that our lives could have been different if they were still around. They were organized. They were everywhere.”</p><p>“Dad didn’t report in to anyone, and he got by just fine,” Sam said. “That’s what made him Dad.”</p><p>“What if they could have stopped Yellow Eyes. Saved Mom.”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He already felt the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn’t particularly want to feel any more.</p><h2><span id="chapter-34">CHAPTER 34</span><a href="#chapter-34" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean’s footsteps creaked on the ancient wood floor of the Rustic Pines Retirement Community. It smelled like a hospital— every surface regularly wiped with disinfectant chemicals, stale processed air. Old people.</p><p>At the end of the hallway, a woman was waiting for him. She introduced herself as Betty, the resident coordinator. As they walked toward the East Wing of the building, she rattled off a list of facts that left Dean’s consciousness as soon as they entered. He really didn’t care about the bingo schedule. He was here for something else entirely.</p><p>They walked past a dozen rooms, all of them occupied. The faces inside looked friendly, content, which comforted Dean. Not a terrible place to grow old.</p><p>“The storage area is downstairs,” Betty said with a glued-on smile. “Excuse the conditions. We don’t usually bring guests down here.”</p><p>She wasn’t kidding. The basement was damp and unwelcoming, to say the least. Dean imagined he could feel the chill of the bare concrete through the soles of his shoes.</p><p>“Just through here,” she indicated.</p><p>A large door blocked their path. Its hinges were rusty and groaned loudly as she tugged on the metal handle. Inside, a sea of musty, ancient boxes greeted them. The remnants of entire lives, Dean thought. Like in the pyramids.</p><p>“I believe the articles you’re looking for are over here.”</p><p>With practiced swiftness, Betty navigated the maze of boxes and pulled out one in particular. The cardboard sagged at the bottom from the weight of its contents.</p><p>“Tell me again, what was your relation?”</p><p>Dean struggled with his answer. In the moment, with that box right in front of him, he couldn’t remember what he had told her on the phone. He took a stab in the dark.</p><p>“She was my great aunt.”</p><p>“She never talked about family. And no family ever visited.” That last sentence contained a jab directed squarely at Dean. An accusatory “Where were you?” was definitely implied.</p><p>“Yeah. Things were strained.”</p><p>“Better late than never, I guess. Although, for Julia, I guess not.” With that, Betty left Dean alone with the box.</p><p>He opened it delicately, almost afraid to touch the material inside.</p><p>Once Betty was definitely out of earshot, Dean whispered quietly, “I’m sorry you didn’t get your picket fence, Julia.”</p><p>Sam waited outside, leaning wearily against the Impala. Things are finally back to normal, he thought. More or less. Not that normal was good. In fact, Sam found himself missing 1954. For all of the tragedy, it had been nice to experience a time when things had been less complicated for a while. No Apocalypse. No horsemen. No impending battle to end all battles.</p><p>Dean walked slowly down the front steps of the retirement home, carrying a single piece of paper.</p><p>“You found her stuff?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah. Let’s get moving.” Dean’s voice was gruff. Sam recognized his I-don’t-want-to talk-about-it face. Not that Sam ever let him get away with it...</p><p>“Dean, come on, what did you find?”</p><p>Dean stopped at the driver’s side door.</p><p>“Nothing worth yapping about.”</p><p>In one swift movement, Sam reached over the hood and snatched the piece of paper from Dean’s hand.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“We’re gonna talk about it eventually. I’m just skipping a six-hour car ride with you brooding the whole way.” Sam unfolded the paper, finding a list written in blocky handwriting. A guy wrote it, Sam realized. Specifically, Walter.</p><p>Sam held in his hands Walter’s transcribed list of bloodlines. At the very end, the words “Michael” and “Lucifer” were written on two consecutive lines. Next to each—nothing. The paper had been cut, Dean and Sam’s names removed from the list.</p><p>“She kept it,” Dean said after a while. “Don’t know what that says.”</p><p>“But she took our names off,” Sam said. “I think that says a lot.”</p><p>Dean opened his door and sat heavily in the driver’s seat. He exhaled loudly enough for Sam to hear it.</p><p>“You... You think you could drive?”</p><p>Those words were so seldom spoken that it took Sam a second to register them.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yeah. I’ve been in the driver’s seat a little too much recently.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Sam rounded the front of the car and swapped seats with Dean.</p><p>“Where we heading?”</p><p>In the passenger seat, Dean had already closed his eyes.</p><p>“Surprise me.”</p><p>As night approached, the Impala motored onto the open road. Toward—for better or worse—their destiny.</p><p><strong>THE END</strong></p><h2><span id="author-s-note">AUTHOR’S NOTE</span><a href="#author-s-note" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>I was pleased to be asked by Christopher Cerasi to write a novel for Supernatural. Since the deadline conflicted with my impending wedding, I asked David Reed if he wanted to collaborate. I owe him great thanks for picking up the ball and running with it when I was crying over the cost of chair rentals. Also much thanks to Christopher for the support and fun phone calls; he has turned out to be a great friend and believer in the show. Thank you to Cath Trechman, who exhibited patience and professionalism throughout this process, and whose love for the written word shines through in her impeccable work. — Rebecca Dessertine</p><p>The authors would like to thank the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, and the exec producers for continuing the most gutsy, rockin’ show on TV.</p><p>Rebecca would like to thank her husband Jason, for his support and love, and her sister Carrie, without whom she wouldn’t understand how deep the love runs between siblings.</p><p>David would like to thank his wife Mairin, for almost never complaining about the insanely late nights that come with writing a novel while also holding a full time job. He’d also like to thank her for baking really great cookies, pretending to be excited about new Halo games, being an amazing mom, and a million more things that make her a great person to be around. In addition, David would also like to thank his son for being so gosh-darn cute.</p><h2><span id="about-the-authors">ABOUT THE AUTHORS</span><a href="#about-the-authors" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>DAVID REED grew up without cable TV, but still turned out all right. After completing nearly half of a computer science degree, he realized that programming computers is way less interesting than watching them turn evil and murder people on television. With that in mind, he set off with his then-girlfriend for Los Angeles, where he got his break working on Battlestar Galactica, subsequently writing the comic book miniseries Battlestar Galactica: Final Five with Seamus Kevin Fahey. Since then, he has branched out from robot mayhem to general mayhem, writing the Syfy Original Movie Lake Placid 3 and the story for the Supernatural episode “Hammer of the Gods.” He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and infant son.</p><p>REBECCA DESSERTINE wrote her first screenplay in fifth grade. She was very disappointed her sequel to Stand By Me was never optioned. After attending NYU at sixteen, she transferred to the University of Virginia, where she finished a degree in drama that turned out to be quite a waste of money after she moved to Los Angeles and discovered she wasn’t a good actress. She has worked for Supernatural for three years. As a writer she co-wrote the second series of the show’s comic Supernatural: Rising Son. She also co-wrote the story for the episode “Swap Meat.” Outside of the Supernatural realm she produced an independent film, Loveless in Los Angeles, that can occasionally be seen on Comedy Central. She currently lives in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park with her husband, dog, and two cats.</p><p>A</p>]]></content>

The book that you currently hold in your hot little hands (or are reading virtually on your hot little tablet doo-hickey) was written by the <span class="italic">Supernatural</span> staff member who knows the inside of my sticky skull better than just about anybody. Better than Sera Gamble or Bob Singer, that’s for sure. You see, Rebecca has the unenviable job of my assistant. Which means she has to tolerate my bellowing rants, my hurling hot coffee in her face. Just kidding—I’m not really that kind of boss—more the compulsively neurotic type—a less photogenic Albert Brooks, if you will. But I digress. In truth, I interact with Rebecca more than anybody on the show—all my notes and drafts go across her desk, she performs crucial research, she contributes brilliant show ideas—and most of all, she sees how our grubby little series is made, from a catbird seat like no other. On top of it all—she’s smart. Damn smart. Damn good writer, too. And all of this adds up to the book (or hologram) you are currently grasping in your meathooks. I think you’ll enjoy the corner she’s staked out within our weird little universe. Because she lives inside that universe as much as any of us. Hell, maybe more. Anyway, have fun. And send a silent prayer to Rebecca—she needs it—after all, she’s got to put up with me.</p><p>Eric Kripke</p><p>Creator &amp; Executive Producer, <span class="italic">Supernatural</span></p><h2><span id="prologue-01">PROLOGUE 01</span><a href="#prologue-01" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Winter 1692</p><p>A pale sliver of crescent moon pinches at the sky. A lone pair of footsteps crunches over a snow-encased field. Through spindly black brush, a young girl emerges and makes her way over the frozen earth. Her full black skirts scrape hieroglyphic shapes into the powdery snow. She stops and studies the ground before her; a covered mound pushes upwards from the earth. Scraping off the moss with her mitten-covered hands she reveals a grave. Despite the cold she proceeds to kneel down before it.</p><p>From beneath her coat she takes out a folded piece of purple fabric. Unwrapping the triangles of cloth, she lays it ceremonially on the frozen earth. Out of her pockets, she produces various objects and sets them precisely on the shroud. Faint moonlight glints off a silver outline of the pentagram extending to the corners. The girl pulls forth several black candles, fighting the wind as she lights them.</p><p>Into a small brass bowl she drops various feather pieces, stone, crystal, and herbs. Then she pulls a small dagger from her coat and presses the blade against her palm. Wincing slightly she slices the soft skin from her index finger to the base. Blood drips into the bowl covering the objects.</p><p>From her pocket she produces a worn book, two fists thick. Nervously, she lays it on her lap, brushing the pages apart with her gloved hands. Her voice wavers as she starts to chant, softly at first, tracing the words with her finger as she reads.</p><p>The wind whips up, steadily increasing to a screaming gale. The girl shades her eyes from the blowing snow but continues to chant over the howl of the cold air. The flakes before her begin to gather, as if attracted to one another by an unseen force, becoming denser and denser. The whirlwind slowly takes on a shape.</p><p>With each howl of the wind more snow coagulates until the figure of a woman solidifies before the girl. The girl peers up at the tall figure. A faint gasp escapes her blue lips. Her eyes move over the vestige of rotting flesh before her. She bows.</p><p>“Madam. I’ve missed you so. I serve only you.”</p><p>The specter’s glassy, dead eyes seem not to register the plea.</p><p>The girl continues. “I’ve done exactly as instructed. I’ve tried so very hard.” She wipes away a small dribble of mucus from her nose. “Council me. I know not how to make more provisions for him.”</p><p>The corners of the specter’s mouth turn upwards into a curdled smile.</p><p>“Why child, know what ye must. Raise us all.”</p><p>The color drains from the girl’s face.</p><p>“I... What if I cannot?” Her tear-streaked face turns upwards. “I’m not as strong as you.”</p><p>The specter’s lips prune into a rotten scowl. Raising her arm, she gives a quick flick of her wrist. The girl catches her breath as if someone startled her from behind. Her hands fly to her throat as a phantom grip tightens down onto her doe-sized neck. Blood rims her corneas, she fails to draw a breath.</p><p>The woman leans down, eye to eye with the girl.</p><p>“Well then, if you cannot do it, I will find someone else.”</p><p>She slowly turns her hand. The girl’s eyes dilate to saucers as the vertebra in her neck go POP, POP, POP, snapping like chicken bones.</p><p>At that moment, from behind, a dark figure emerges from the tree line. She approaches the girl silently, produces a knife and with one hand grabs the girl’s neck as the blade slices across her throat. Her small body falls limp into the snow, lifeless dark eyes staring out across the white expanse.</p><p>The pages of the old tome flap like the wings of a downed bird.</p><p>The figure holds the knife downward as blood drips from its blade. She picks up the book and continues the incantation as the blood petals over the white snow; spreading and soaking the purple cloth.</p><p>“Deviser of Darkness, <span class="italic">imus adque deportamus...”</span></p><p>As the woman continues the chant, the specter darkens and materializes. With each word the figure becomes more corporeal: Her limbs take shape. The rancid skin on her face smoothes and tightens. Her rotting, torn clothes repair themselves.</p><p>The woman stops chanting, and looks at the creature before her.</p><p>“Dear mother, I’ve missed you so.”</p><p>The old woman nods, and the two walk off across the field together.</p><p>Snow wafts over the young girl’s dead body. Gradually, the snow covers the slight figure, blending it into the white landscape.</p><h2><span id="prologue-02">PROLOGUE 02</span><a href="#prologue-02" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>2010</p><p>Dean and Sam swig from a bottle as they barrel-ass down a dark country road. Dean cranks the tunes. Sam smiles and lays back into the Impala’s passenger seat. All is right with the world.</p><p>“How long till we get there?” Sam asks.</p><p>Dean casts a sidewards glance at Sam. “Dude, you’re my personal Garmin, figure it out.”</p><p>Dean smiles, he loves making Sam feel like the little brother. But Sam doesn’t respond.</p><p>“You’re my co-pilot. Just without the uniform.”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>“Sam? You in there? When are we going to get there?” Dean asks, a flicker of concern on his face.</p><p>Sam turns toward Dean.</p><p>“We’ll never get there, Dean. It’s over. All over. I’m gone.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean woke with a start. His flailing arm hit the quarter-full glass of Scotch on the bedside table. A brown spot on the cream-colored sisal rug widened to a stain. <span class="italic">Crap.</span></p><p>Hefting himself up off the bed Dean reached for the towel that was draped over the chair by the window. But as his feet hit the ground, the sheets wrapped around his ankles, impeding his progress. Tied and tripped up, he landed on his face.</p><p>“Perfect, another kick-ass way to start the day, Dean,” he muttered to himself.</p><p>The bedroom door creaked open. Dean studied the pair of feet sporting nicely painted toenails that moved into his eyeline. He looked up. Lisa Braeden stood over him with a pitying smile on her face. Dean had grown quite accustomed to the expression that he induced almost every time they spoke. It was the same face Dean was met with when six weeks ago he showed up on her doorstep, after God knows how many years. They hadn’t been serious, it was just a couple of dates, years ago. But Dean and Sam had come to her rescue when her housing development had been taken over by a serious case of deadly child-nappers.</p><p>“Nice to see you made it this far out of bed today. That’s farther than any day this week.”</p><p>Bleary-eyed, Dean nodded. This is his life.</p><h2><span id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</span><a href="#chapter-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’ll make you some eggs,” Lisa said as she picked up a pair of jeans from the floor. “We’re going to Morse Reservoir today, if you want to come.”</p><p>Dean heaved himself back onto the bed.</p><p>“No thanks. I’ll just stay here.”</p><p>Lisa’s eyes flicked over Dean’s unshaven face.</p><p>“Why don’t you come? It might be fun. Remember fun?”</p><p>Dean smiled tightly, the levity of the conversation almost making him nauseous.</p><p>“Besides, you haven’t talked to Ben in a week.” Lisa sat on the bed next to Dean, taking his hand in hers. “I don’t mind you staying in our spare room, but it’s like living with a ghost. I told you I wasn’t going to push you—“</p><p>“You’re right, you did.” Dean cut in, immediately regretting his tone. “I’m sorry. I’m trying.”</p><p>“I know you are. So am I. That’s why I’m asking you if you want to go to the park.”</p><p>She brushed the light hairs on the back of Dean’s hand. The pure emotion made his stomach twist.</p><p>Dean withdrew his hand from Lisa’s.</p><p>“Give me a couple minutes.”</p><p>Lisa pursed her lips, as though she wanted to say more. Instead, she kissed Dean on the cheek and stood up. At the door she turned and held up Dean’s discarded jeans.</p><p>“Just in case you care to join us, I’m going to throw these in the wash.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>Lisa closed the door to Dean’s room, slowly clicking the lock. She stood there for a moment wondering whether she had made a mistake when Dean came to her front door and she let him into her and her son’s life. Ben was twelve, impressionable and sensitive. She knew deep down how kind and generous Dean was, but she also knew that the years of hunting had calloused his ability to commit himself emotionally. She thought that perhaps she could get through to him. Two months on, she wondered if she had done the right thing. Emotionally, Dean was an out-of-control rollercoaster with faulty brakes. It was only a matter of time before he ran off the rails.</p><p>Dean sat on the edge of the bed, then lay back and closed his eyes. In his head he played over again the vision of Sam jumping into the pit of Hell: the fiery opening swirling and writhing in the middle of the cemetery. He had been there for his brother, but there hadn’t been anything he could do to stop him. Talk about being impotent. Sam <span class="italic">had</span> to jump, but an acidy feeling of regret constantly swirled in Dean’s stomach. He should have stopped him. But there wasn’t any other way. Every so often, like every two minutes, Dean’s heart would palpitate and leap into his throat. The reality was constantly there, Dean’s brain wouldn’t let it go: Sam was gone forever.</p><p>The smoky Scotch he drank in large gulps helped his cause. But frequently, mid-morning, after Ben had gone to school and Lisa had left to teach an early morning yoga class in Carmel, Dean’s mind would clear enough so that once again he remembered, moment by moment, Sam jumping into the pit.</p><p>There had been no other way to save the world. Sam had said “yes,” and Lucifer had taken over Sam’s body. The plan rested on the tenuous idea that Sam could somehow gain enough consciousness that he could hurl himself, with Lucifer within him, into the hole. The brothers had collected all four horsemen’s rings—Death gave Dean his ring outright—and together the rings opened up the portal to Hell.</p><p>But it didn’t go down like that. They weren’t able to get Lucifer into the portal. As was their fate, Lucifer and Michael met on the battlefield, ready to duke it out. The collateral damage would only be a few hundred million lives, and no one would need Pay-Per-View for this fight, it was going to be right outside everyone’s front door.</p><p>But on that field, in the middle of the fight, somehow Sam had gained enough control of his own body, while possessed by Lucifer, to hurl himself into the cage. And there he would stay for eternity.</p><p>With that act, a hole had opened up in Dean’s soul and there was no way to fill it. The Scotch only anesthetized him for a few hours. After that, the thoughts would come flooding back. The panicky guilt would set in and Dean would race down the stairs to the kitchen looking for everything and anything to drink in order to knock himself out again.</p><p>Once, Lisa had found him on the kitchen floor in just his boxers: a bottle of cough syrup spilled onto the linoleum beside him, a glass smashed on the floor and several shards embedded in his feet. Lisa had patiently brought him upstairs and put him into the shower then waited until he had sobered up enough to get into bed.</p><p>The next morning when Dean woke, Lisa was perched on the side of his bed watching him.</p><p>“Not your finest moment yesterday,” she said.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry about that. Maybe it wasn’t the best idea coming here.”</p><p>“Maybe, but I want you to get better, Dean.”</p><p>Dean drew his fingers across his brow and pinched them together.</p><p>“I don’t think you can get better from something like this. That’s why I should probably leave.” Dean made a move to get out of bed.</p><p>“You’re not leaving. You can stay here as long as you want. But you have to make the decision if you want to move past this.”</p><p>“You can’t just move on from something like this, Lis. I let him do it.”</p><p>“There was no other way. Remember you said that? I can’t forgive you, Dean. You have to do that on your own.” Lisa got up and turned at the door. “You couldn’t have done anything else.”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “I’m not so sure about that.”</p><p>“No one could have.” Lisa’s hand hovered over the doorknob. “I’ll bring you up some coffee.” She shut the door, leaving Dean with his heart beating in his ears.</p><p>Day by day, Dean had started to rejoin the ranks of the living: he got up a little earlier rather than sleeping until noon, at night he would join Lisa and Ben while they were watching TV, still with a bottle close to hand, but drinking a little less every day.</p><p>Dean’s relationship with Lisa thrived through Dean’s self-imposed confinement.</p><p>“I know how to do laundry, Lisa.” Dean leaned against the washing machine as Lisa separated out the whites and coloreds.</p><p>“No. You don’t. Everything you wear is that same olive grey because you don’t separate your whites and coloreds.”</p><p>Dean looked down at his olive-gray T-shirt. She had a point. “I like this color,” he said. “I look good in it.”</p><p>“It’s fatigue green. Let’s go get you something in blue or even red.”</p><p>“I’m not wearing red. It’s a shade of pink.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Lisa said, smiling as she leaned over to grab the laundry detergent, her face a few inches from Dean’s.</p><p>Dean looked into her dark eyes and grabbed her arm. A pull inside of him wanted to do more, to hold her. But he just couldn’t.</p><p>“I don’t want to mess up your life,” he said.</p><p>“You’re not. And I won’t let you. Now let me go. I have to put in the fabric softener ball.”</p><p>“What the hell is that?”</p><p>Lisa grabbed the powder-blue ball, snapped off the cover and poured fabric softener into the hole.</p><p>“What does that do?” Dean asked, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>“Fabric softener, to make your clothes softer.” Lisa smirked.</p><p>“I didn’t know that was really a thing. Making clothes softer.”</p><p>“Oh young Jedi, I have so much to teach you.” Lisa slammed the washer shut, spun the dial and gave Dean a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>It was the first moment of levity that Dean had felt for weeks. But even as Dean’s life normalized, thoughts about Sam haunted him.</p><p>“Never thought I would see you reading a self-help book.”</p><p>Dean opened his eyes. He had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room. On his chest a copy of <span class="italic">Chicken Soup for the Soul</span> was flipped open. That night Lisa had said, “Why don’t you read this?” She pulled it from a shelf and handed it to Dean. “It helped me when my grandmother died.” Dean accepted the book reluctantly, but after reading a couple of pages he sort of got into it.</p><p>Sam leaned over and pulled the book from Dean’s chest.</p><p>“‘101 stories to open the heart and rekindle the spirit’? Really Dean? That’s lame, even for you.”</p><p>Dean peered at his brother through sleepy eyes. Sam stood before him in bloody clothes, with his face looking like a wild animal had ravaged it. Sam’s lip had been torn—more like bitten off—his teeth peeked through beneath. His left ear had shriveled and darkened and on his left arm a swath of skin peeled from shoulder to wrist. His body had been scorched from top to bottom, layers of raw skin stuck to his clothes in slick black patches.</p><p>On some level, Dean knew he was imagining his brother standing before him. His dreams had been tormenting him like hounds. This evening was no exception.</p><p>“Sam.”</p><p>“Long time no see, bro. Of course, as you can see, I’m having some trouble. They burned my eyes with pokers. I can only really get a good look at you if I go like this.” Sam turned his head slightly to the side. His eyes were scarred into cataracts. Dean winced. Sam swung around, checking out the room. “Nice place. Comfy. Lot nicer than where I am. ‘Course it’s a little different for me down there being pulled apart fiber by fiber by a thousand rabid demons. No worries, though. I’m glad <span class="italic">you’re</span> comfortable up here.”</p><p>“It’s not like that, Sam. I tried. What else am I supposed to do? Cass is gone. How am I going to get to you?”</p><p>“No. I get it, Dean. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be okay. I’m fine being barebacked by Lucifer every second for the next couple of hundred millennia.”</p><p>“I would do anything to get you out.”</p><p>“You sure about that? It looks to me like you are just doing what you always wanted.” Sam growled, but the force of the movement proved too much. He shook his head and spit a molar out into his hand. “Never did get my wisdom teeth out. They’re taking care of that right now.”</p><p>Dean was now up off the couch, face to face with the specter of his brother.</p><p>“Sam, you told me to come here to Lisa’s. Remember? Barbecues, football games.”</p><p>Sam winced.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Oh nothing, just a pesky demon who keeps playing the Operation game with my liver. I lost my funny bone first, wouldn’t you know. Maybe that would have helped me get through this with a sense of humor.”</p><p>“Sam, tell me what I can do. There has to be someone down there that knows how to break you out.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me. Have a good life, Dean.”</p><p>With that, Sam vanished.</p><p>Dean woke up in a cold sweat. His hands had clenched the book so tightly, the paperback was waded into a ball. The room was empty.</p><p>Dean swung his heels to the floor and hung his head. He felt as if someone had reached inside and pulled out his intestines through his eyes. The excruciating pain, the guilt, was beyond anything he had ever experienced.</p><p>He heard footsteps and looked up to see Lisa appear at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>“You okay? I heard you scream,” she said anxiously.</p><p>“I’m fine. Go back to sleep.” Sweat dripped down his forehead.</p><p>Lisa walked across the room and sat down next to Dean on the couch.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” she insisted gently.</p><p>“Lisa, please. I’m fine.”</p><p>“We talked about you seeing someone before.”</p><p>“I’m not seeing a psychiatrist. I’m fine. Really.”</p><p>Lisa nodded and then left him alone.</p><p>Lisa had been trying to get him to see a therapist since he showed up. It was part of the normal mourning process, she told Dean. Not that the Winchester family had ever had a <span class="italic">normal</span> mourning process. It seemed to Dean as if they had died and come back so many times. Dean wondered how long it would be until he finally <span class="italic">did</span> crack. Until his soul finally fractured under all the pain he had seen, caused, and felt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-two">CHAPTER TWO</span><a href="#chapter-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“It’s normal to feel guilty when a family member passes, especially under extraordinary circumstances. Your brother died how, exactly?” Dr. Hodes took off her glasses and peered at Dean, slouched on the patterned couch opposite her.</p><p>“Um. Mining accident. We were both miners and he fell into a pit.”</p><p>“Terribly sorry. That’s an awful way to pass.”</p><p>“Yeah. It is. Listen Doc—“</p><p>“You can call me Linda.”</p><p>“Linda. I just need to know when this is going to go away. I’m putting my girl—well, my friend through hell. I’m staying at her place and I just need to be set straight again.”</p><p>“Dean, I’m sorry, things don’t work that way. We live in the real world where no magic power is going to restore your brother or take away your pain. What we need to focus on is why you have this guilt.”</p><p>“How about angels?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Nothing. I’m sorry. I think this was a waste of time.” Dean rose from the couch and dug into his pockets.</p><p>“Dean, why don’t you sit down? Let’s talk about how therapy might help you so it doesn’t feel like the weight of the world is on you and you alone.”</p><p>“It’s not anymore, Linda. It was on my brother and he took care of that. Thanks for your time.” Dean pulled a wad of cash from his pocket, counted out some bills and placed them on the coffee table. He then grabbed his jacket and left the office.</p><p>When Lisa returned home that night Dean was on the couch surrounded by a pile of books.</p><p>“I see you found the library,” she said putting down her purse and peering into the kitchen. “Where’s Ben?”</p><p>“He’s in bed,” Dean said flipping a page. “We ate macaroni and cheese, watched <span class="italic">30 Rock,</span> then he conked out.”</p><p>“So what’s all this?” Lisa already could tell she was going to regret asking the question.</p><p>“Um. Nothing really.”</p><p>“So you’re just doing some light reading?” Lisa picked up a Carl Sagan book, then put it down. “Why, Dean?”</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Because I want to know that I’ve exhausted every possible way of getting him out of there.”</p><p>“By what? Turning back time? I mean this is...” Lisa looked around wide-eyed. “This is even a little too much for me.”</p><p>Dean set down the book he was reading.</p><p>“I tried it your way; Dr. Melfi didn’t work. Let me exhaust this as one last option. Please?”</p><p>Lisa shrugged, what else could she do. These past weeks Dean had seemed more connected to her and Ben. If he needed to do a little reading, perhaps it wasn’t the worst thing in the world.</p><p>“Okay. I’m going to bed. Night,” she said.</p><p>“Night,” Dean said, already engrossed in another book.</p><p>“You know I’m not coming back,” Sam said. The light from oncoming cars flickered over his face.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m aware.” Dean clenched his jaw.</p><p>“So you’ve got to promise me something.”</p><p>“Okay. Yeah. Anything.”</p><p>“You got to promise not to try to bring me back.”</p><p>Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. What awaited Sam in Hell made Dean’s time down there look like the ball pit in a McDonald’s playground; fun but a little smelly. It wasn’t going to be the same for Sam. Sam was going to get the royal treatment. He would be toast. Dean couldn’t just let his brother rot in Hell.</p><p>“So, what am I supposed to do?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You go find Lisa. You pray she’s dumb enough to take you in. You go have barbeques. And you go to football games. You go live some normal apple pie life, Dean. Promise me,” Sam said, looking at his brother.</p><p>Far away lights blinked in and out over the cornfields of Michigan as the Impala raced past. They were rocketing toward their destiny. Sam knew it. Dean knew it.</p><p>Dean’s throat was dry. He wasn’t supposed to even <span class="italic">try</span> to get his brother back?</p><p>Dean lay in bed for twenty minutes staring at the ceiling, thinking about Sam. Downstairs he could hear Lisa and Ben getting ready to go to the reservoir. Dean knew life was precious, at any point they could go and most likely be gone forever. Then somehow whatever was holding Dean back, the bind finally dissolved. A weight lifted off him. Dean decided he should join Lisa and Ben. He would do this for Sam.</p><p>“Hey, buddy,” Dean greeted Ben gruffly as he appeared in the kitchen doorway freshly showered and shaved.</p><p>Ben looked up from his breakfast. He beamed an accepting smile at Dean.</p><p>“Hey. Are you coming with us today?”</p><p>Lisa looked over from the stove, a wordless communication passed between them and Dean nodded. She understood him. Her limitless patience and acceptance was not the only thing Dean appreciated. As Lisa turned back toward the scrambled eggs Dean couldn’t help but admire her tightly jean-clad backside. He quickly turned his attention to Ben.</p><p>“What’s on the agenda at the park?”</p><p>“Fishing,” Ben said, devouring the last bit of toast. “But I’m always the one that has to hook the worms for Mom.”</p><p>“I’m squeamish with anything squishy,” Lisa said, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, we can’t have that,” Dean said, taking a place on a stool next to Ben. “I mean, it’s every man for themselves when it comes to fishing. Right Ben?”</p><p>“I’ve tried to teach her, but it’s useless.”</p><p>“I have a Winchester method that my father taught me.” Dean lightly tapped Ben on the arm. “We’ll get your mom up to speed. Next thing you know she’ll be on <span class="italic">Bass Masters.”</span></p><p>Lisa set down some eggs, toast and a cup of coffee in front of Dean.</p><p>“I’m not going to be on <span class="italic">Bass Masters.”</span></p><p>Dean took a scoop of eggs.</p><p>“If I had known there was this type of service around here, I might have come downstairs more often,” he said.</p><p>Lisa smiled. “The chef serves, the eaters wash up.”</p><p>Dean made a face at Ben.</p><p>“I cleaned up last night,” Ben said, taking his plate to the sink. “That means it’s your turn.”</p><p>Lisa leaned over the counter and sipped at her coffee. She chided, “Gotta pull your own weight around here.”</p><p>Dean shoveled more eggs into his mouth. He might be able to do that.</p><p>“Ben, go get ready. Pull the tackle box and rods from the garage and set them out front. Okay?” Lisa said.</p><p>“Okay.” Ben slid off the stool and disappeared through the laundry-room door leading to the garage.</p><p>A silence fell between Dean and Lisa. She put her hand on his knee.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Dean set down his fork and peered into Lisa’s dark eyes. He gently brushed a lock of hair from her forehead. Dean had been sleeping in Lisa’s guest room for two months and never once had she asked why Dean had chosen her.</p><p>“Lisa, Sam told me to come here. To be with you.”</p><p>“Are you telling me you’re only here because Sam told you to come?”</p><p>“No. Initially, I didn’t know where else to go. But also, yes, because he wanted me to be with you. Because even if I didn’t want to admit it, he knew I wanted a life where I didn’t have to worry if there’s something around the corner ready to jump me. Sam knew me better than I knew myself. I’m sorry. I should have told you this weeks ago.”</p><p>“I don’t care if you’re here because Sam said so. You wouldn’t have stayed unless you wanted to. Right?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Then I guess it means you want to stay. Maybe you should start accepting that, rather than beating yourself up about it. Moving forward isn’t a bad thing, Dean. And if you want to move forward with me and Ben, well... I’m willing to try that. You get what I’m saying?”</p><p>Dean understood. Even though the very fabric of his soul resisted the idea that he deserved good things, perhaps he couldn’t suffer any longer. There wasn’t anything he could do for Sam now except what he had asked: to be happy with Lisa.</p><h2><span id="chapter-three">CHAPTER THREE</span><a href="#chapter-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Moo shoo pork?” Dean called. He pulled the food container from the box on the kitchen table.</p><p>“That’s mine,” Ben yelled, racing from the living room to the kitchen, “and I want white rice.”</p><p>“Brown rice. It’s better for you.” Lisa said, spooning rice onto a plate for Ben.</p><p>“Okay, whatever.” Ben grabbed the plate and carried it back to his position in front of the television.</p><p>“Whoa, what’s the rush?” Dean asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Ben turned up the sound.</p><p>“Not so loud,” Lisa called, taking her place across the dinner table from Dean. She smiled as Dean cracked open a beer and dug into his chow mein.</p><p>“Not a bad place,” Dean said, between bites.</p><p>“And you wanted to go to the Golden Palace again.” Lisa smiled. “I don’t know why you like it so much. You think that waitress is cute, don’t you?”</p><p>“She doesn’t have anything on you,” Dean said, picking up Lisa’s free hand and kissing her palm.</p><p>The last couple of weeks with Dean had been, if anything, simply idyllic: Dean had found a job refurbishing old buildings in nearby towns, and he was even cooking every once in a while. Life with Dean was great, even after everything they had been through in the beginning. Lisa never thought that Dean would walk back into her life, but here he was. It was strange. Years ago she had resigned herself to being a single mother. She had practically mastered being a single parent: she went to Ben’s softball games, covered the parent/teacher conferences, stayed up late with Ben when he had the stomach flu. She handled a lot: the carpooling, lugging sports equipment, even the science projects which she never really understood. Lisa did it all. But it was the loneliness she felt at night that made her really want a partner. Then Dean showed up and all that changed.</p><p>Dean had never lived a normal life except those first years in Lawrence, Kansas before his mother was killed. Life with Lisa was exactly what he had imagined domesticity to be. There was no denying it; Dean was happy. He was like a regular guy: he had bought a truck and retired the Impala, and had even taken Ben to a couple of Indianapolis Indians baseball games.</p><p>Lisa had introduced Dean to the next-door neighbors. As summer approached cookouts became commonplace and Dean wholeheartedly took part in all suburbia had to offer.</p><p>On those summer nights Dean manned the grill while the neighborhood kids and Ben ran around menacing everyone with super soakers. And as the spring days dripped away into nights buzzing with the sound of cicadas, Dean’s dreams about Sam stopped. For the first time in months Dean had slept through the night.</p><p>“You’ve got to help me, sis!” An inflated music score of a network show blared out from the television.</p><p>“Ben. Turn it down!” Lisa pulled her chair around and stared at the back of Ben’s head. He was thoroughly engrossed and ignored the command. Lisa sprang to her feet.</p><p>“I’ll get it.” Dean stuffed an egg roll into his mouth and crossed to the living room. “Ben, your mom is talking to you.”</p><p>Ben nodded but didn’t make a move. Picking up the remote, Dean pointed it at the TV to turn down the volume.</p><p>“Carrissa, please.” On the screen a blonde clad in black leather pants was being whipped around by an invisible force. “Use the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>!”</p><p>A brunette girl flipped through the elaborate pages of a large grimoire. “I’m trying. Here it is!” She began a Latin incantation. The wind subsided and the blonde dropped to the floor. The girls—sisters, Dean gathered—hugged each other. They had just escaped some sort of supernatural force and both of them wanted to go home. But how would they hide this from their mother? The two girls quipped a couple of lines of tween banter.</p><p>“What’s this?” Dean asked.</p><p>“It’s a new show. It’s about two teenage witches.” Ben blushed a bit. “But they’re badass, not like stupid witches.”</p><p>“What’s it called?”</p><p><span class="italic">“Spell Bound.”</span></p><p><span class="italic">“Spell Bound,</span> huh?” Dean sat down, and paused the show.</p><p>On screen, the book they called the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> hovered in digital stasis. During all of his obsessing over the past couple of months Dean hadn’t thought about the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>The book had been thought to be a work of fiction by twentieth-century occultist and novelist H.P. Lovecraft. A Wikipedia search could bring up enough facts about it to make any Hollywood screenwriter seem sufficiently knowledgeable about the work; thus its appearance in the pop-song scored, tween show of which Ben was a fan.</p><p>But in truth, the book had existed over millennia, though it had been called a couple of different things: <span class="italic">The Red Dragon, The Great Grimoire.</span> These texts had all been combined, picked apart, then combined again. But the original text was thought to have come from one man, some seven hundred years before Christ’s birth in Sumeria, what is now Iraq. It had been recopied, abridged and added to over centuries. The original was in an ancient form of Arabic, but it was later translated into Latin, Greek, German, and French by other scholars, monks, and priests.</p><p>The book contained ancient rights and spells with which to bind gods, which were in actuality demons. When the book was translated by Christians it was interpreted with less mysticism and more religion. The unorthodox nature of the text made many Christian scholars nervous, so they added locks and safety measures into the text, but it still stayed powerful.</p><p>Despite the changes made to the incantations, the text included spells for necromancy, raising the dead, the binding of demons, and mastery over the earthbound. If someone knew what they were doing the book was as potent as the day it was written. But there was one spell in particular—the only spell in the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> which Dean was interested in—a spell that could raise Lucifer.</p><p>The brothers had toiled to get Lucifer into the cage, but the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was written to release Lucifer and bind him—a whole different story to raising Lucifer and starting the Apocalypse. It had never been done before because all sixty-six seals had to have been broken. But Sam had taken care of that and that meant that, in theory at least, Lucifer could now be raised and bound.</p><p>If Dean could get Lucifer out of Hell, he would be getting Sam out of the cage as well. Lucifer would no longer have to fight Michael, so he might have lost his spunk and perhaps could be lassoed silent for enough time for Dean to expel Lucifer from his brother’s body. But the first step would be freeing Lucifer.</p><p>Dean thought about where he could find a complete enough version of the book. The brothers had run into a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> a couple of times, though usually only abridged, watered-down, fit-for-public-consumption pamphlets. An elementary version of the book had been used by the teens who had switched Sam into the body of a suburban geek a couple of years ago. It was witchcraft all right, but the pesky, pimpled kids had probably picked up their copy in a head shop.</p><p>The actual <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was locked up in a cloister somewhere in Europe. Chances were that H.P. Lovecraft had made most of his version up, since reading from the actual text is often fatal—it can only be used by someone very practiced and powerful. Dean was pretty sure that Amazon wasn’t selling the originals. He had to find a real one.</p><p>And then who would help him cast the spell? He needed someone who knew how to handle powerful magic. Witches and those who practice witchcraft had used the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and texts like it since ancient cultures developed an alphabet. The lineage of the sorcerers familiar with the book trickled down from ancient Sumeria to today. But where was Dean going to find a witch? He couldn’t ask Bobby to point him in the right direction, and he and Sam had ganked every other witch that they had encountered. Finding a witch that was powerful enough and willing to help Dean might be difficult in Cicero, Indiana.</p><p>Dean sat down next to Ben, who again commandeered the remote.</p><p>“You want more?” Lisa called to Dean. “If not I’m saving it for leftovers.”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer, he was thinking about his brother.</p><h2><span id="chapter-four">CHAPTER FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam peered at the house through the Impala’s rain-splattered windshield. They had followed their mark home, but there hadn’t been any movement since he went inside.</p><p>“What do you think he’s doing in there?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What else would a guy who has killed everyone in his family be doing?” Dean said.</p><p>“You think he did it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Totally. You’re such a softy, Sam. You think he’s in there making a fluffer-nutter and sitting down to watch <span class="italic">Frontline</span>? No, he’s getting ready to go out and eat more human flesh. He’s the last man standing. Of course he did it. He’s gotta be a rugaru or a shapeshifter or something.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t so sure. Granted, Nick Warner <span class="italic">had</span> been found in the house where all three of his family members were found dead. But he claimed that he was sleeping and didn’t hear anything. Plus, the police had cleared him. However, in all of Sam and Dean’s travels they had come across stranger things. It could be a case of amnesia. Certainly in werewolf cases they had encountered the infected people didn’t remember anything when they turned back. Maybe Nick Warner didn’t remember killing his family.</p><p>“We have to just wait and see.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve had enough, I’m going in,” Dean said as he kicked open the car door and grabbed his sawed-off from the back seat.</p><p>“Dean, wait. What’re you gonna do? Just walk into the guy’s house? That’s breaking and entering,” Sam said, following closely behind his brother, shotgun in hand.</p><p>“Not the way I do it. The way I do it, it’s just breaking.”</p><p>Dean stomped up the steps and yelled, “Nick Warner, we know you’re in there. Come out with your hands up or we’re coming to get you!”</p><p>“What are you going to do when he comes out and sees you’re not the police, Kojak?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “Just let me handle that pa—“</p><p>A horrible scream came from inside the house. Followed by the sound of breaking furniture.</p><p>“Watch out!” Dean cried.</p><p>He stepped back, then hurled his shoulder into the door. The lock splintered away, revealing the dark interior beyond.</p><p>“Mr. Warner? Nick Warner?” Sam called.</p><p>The house had fallen silent. Dean motioned that he was going to check the back rooms, and he indicated that Sam should sweep the upper floors. As Sam crept up the stairway, a dark streak crossed quickly before him. A door slammed at the top of the landing. Sam stood before the door with his shotgun at the ready, then slowly turned the door handle and entered the room.</p><p>On the bed a nasty old crone crouched over a tied and bound man, who Sam assumed to be Nick Warner. She was up to her elbows in Nick, her hand jammed into his mouth. Nick was turning blue. She was trying to tear out his heart.</p><p>Sam pulled the trigger back and aimed at the crone’s back. But she was quick. In moments, the old hag humped on top of him and overpowered his large frame. He struggled beneath her weight, her putrid breath wet his face with corpse-smelling saliva.</p><p>“Dean!” Sam yelled.</p><p>The crone was stronger than her bony body suggested. Both Sam’s arms were pinned to the floor. She bent down and examined Sam’s face. Sam half expected her to tell him how pretty he was. Instead she said, “I’m going to eat your heart.”</p><p>“Talk about cliché,” Dean said from the doorway.</p><p>The crone’s dark pupils swept over Dean.</p><p>“You’re next. But first I’m going to take his liver,” she cackled.</p><p>She shot her arm down Sam’s throat. His eyes bugged out, and he fought against her with his one free arm.</p><p>BLAM! The bullet blew apart the crone’s head. Her body slumped over. Sam gagged and threw the body off him. He rubbed his tongue with his hand, trying to get the taste of the old woman’s disgusting limb out of his mouth.</p><p>“Yum. Croney,” Dean said.</p><p>He took one look at Nick Warner and his smile vanished.</p><p>“Let’s get this poor guy to the hospital. He’s lost a lot of blood.”</p><p>“I almost lost a liver. I can still feel her fingers touching my stomach lining,” Sam said with a grimace. “So, I guess Nick wasn’t to blame.”</p><p>“Nope, guess not,” Dean said, untying the poor man from the bed. He then hoisted him onto his shoulder. “Come on, let’s get going.”</p><p>Later that night, as Dean and Sam drove out of the small North Dakota town, they both enjoyed a moment of quiet contemplation. The feeling that they were doing good in the world.</p><p>Dean woke from his reverie.</p><p>“You seem far away.” Lisa leaned back in her lawn chair and regarded Dean.</p><p>It was a very warm day, summer was in full swing and Ben was out riding his bike with friends. Dean had been staring into space silently for a good twenty minutes without speaking. His mind <span class="italic">was</span> far away, in a different dimension entirely, he was thinking about breaking Sam out of the cage. The terrible dreams about Sam had stopped, but Dean’s obsession with springing Sam had not.</p><p>“What’s going on in there?” Lisa tapped Dean’s head with her index finger.</p><p>Dean dusted away the cobwebs.</p><p>“I’m good. I’m good. Don’t I look good?”</p><p>“Yes. I was just wondering what you were thinking,” Lisa said, then held up her hand in defense. “I know it’s one of the cardinal sins of relationships to ask a guy what he’s thinking. But I figure I have a kid, I’m way past stuff like that.”</p><p>“I’m thinking...” Dean in fact knew he couldn’t tell Lisa what he was thinking. <span class="italic">The</span> Necronomicon, he thought. <span class="italic">I’m thinking about how I’m going to find a powerful ancient book, steal it, and then use it to bounce my brother</span>—<span class="italic">who is probably already ripped to shreds</span>—<span class="italic">out of Hell. I know I said I would stop obsessing about Sam. But I just can’t help but think this book could get me my brother back.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Now of course finding a copy will prove difficult, there might not even be one in the United States. Even if I do get my hands on it, I’ll have other problems, like figuring out how to get Lucifer out of my brother’s body. I’m hoping the binding spell in the</span> Necronomicon <span class="italic">will help me cast Lucifer back, just not in Sam’s body.</span></p><p><span class="italic">To top it all off, thinking I need to find a powerful person, most likely a witch, to help me with the whole thing. So basically I’m thinking about doing the impossible</span>—<span class="italic">getting Sam out of Hell.</span></p><p>Dean knew he couldn’t say all that to Lisa. So he said the thing that every woman likes to hear.</p><p>“Let’s go on vacation.”</p><p>Lisa sat up to face him. “Really? Dean, that would be so wonderful. Ben would love that. The last vacation Ben and I had was when he was six. We went to a water park in Michigan and I got the flu and couldn’t take him on any of the rides. A vacation would be perfect.” She leaned over and kissed Dean on the mouth.</p><p>“Wow, if I’d known I’d get that reaction I would have mentioned it weeks ago.”</p><p>“Where are we going to go?” Lisa asked.</p><p><span class="italic">Where would we go?</span> Dean thought about it. He responded with an answer that was impossible to disagree with.</p><p>“It’s a surprise, been planning it for a while. I’ll let you know.”</p><p>“Dean, that’s great. Ben is going to flip.”</p><p>Lisa was happy. Mentioning a vacation was a symbol that Dean was finally moving on from his past; putting away the crazy life that he had led for twenty-five years. Normal people take vacations. A vacation would mean Dean had finally joined the ranks of the normal and he’d retired from hunting monsters and killing things.</p><p>Of course, Lisa would never tell Dean how she felt about his old life, in fact she had always told him to do what he wanted. She didn’t want to mold Dean. He was unmoldable. But if Dean made changes himself she was more than happy to accept them.</p><p>Dean smiled. A vacation would be nice. But even as he thought about where they should go—Disneyland, Yellowstone, New York—there was something that unnerved him. For the past few months Dean had been in self-imposed exile. Even though he had begun to play suburban Ken—he had begun working, his life with Lisa and Ben was happy and fulfilled, and the memory of Sam had become less like a gnawing and more like an slight stitch that panged his soul—Dean still felt guilty about truly enjoying himself. And the idea that the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> could possibly liberate Sam from Hell was tantalizing.</p><p>“Salem?” Lisa peered at Dean over breakfast.</p><p>“Sure, I mean, look. They have the beach, restaurants, and old clipper ships. It will be educational. Ben will love it. Really.” Dean pushed the AAA brochure over to Lisa.</p><p>She stared at it skeptically.</p><p>“It’s not a vacation destination though. Is it?”</p><p>“Of course it is, look at all the tourists in this picture!” Dean beamed.</p><p>Lisa looked at Dean’s satisfied face. She couldn’t really argue about it, any vacation would be nice.</p><p>“Okay. Salem it is.”</p><p>“Ten AM. Everyone ready. “ Dean took the last swig of his coffee.</p><p>“Really?” Lisa asked. “You want to leave now?”</p><p>“Sure, why not? What are we waiting for?” Dean wanted to be heading east as soon as possible. He could have driven the fifteen-hour car ride in one sitting, but he knew that Lisa would balk at that. They would probably stop halfway through New York State. After that it would be an easy five-or six-hour drive.</p><p>Thinking about it the night before, Dean had realized that to find a witch he was going to have to go somewhere legendary—Europe was out of the question, but the next best place was Salem. That town had to be teeming with witches. He could have a nice family vacation with Lisa and Ben and also find a witch that could help him raise Sam from the dead.</p><p>Lore said that a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> had been burned during the Salem witch trials in 1692. Chances were that someone in that town still had one. Dean reasoned if he could find the book, he’d find the witch. But he would have to be prepared.</p><p>“I’m going to go out and pick up a couple of things,” Dean yelled, grabbing the keys to his truck. “I’ll be back in a half-hour. Be ready.”</p><p>Dean knew he had to have plenty of protection once he was in Salem; a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> wasn’t something to fool around with, and the person who would be powerful enough to use it wouldn’t be either. He decided to stop off at the local garden store; there was no better place to find mandrake, hemlock or monkshood. Not only were these things essential for making hex bags and protection spells, they all made excellent perennial ground cover.</p><p>After shopping, Dean sat in his truck outside the garden store. He snipped off the plants’ tops and threw the pots of soil out his truck window, drawing stares from the store employees. Feeling guilty, he got out of the truck and took the pots back inside to be recycled. <span class="italic">Wow,</span> he thought, <span class="italic">I</span> am <span class="italic">a suburban douche-dweller.</span></p><p>Back at home Dean took the cut plants and some of the weapons he kept in the trunk of the Impala, and packed them into his duffle.</p><p>Dean didn’t touch the Impala anymore. He had shoved it into the garage and covered it with a tarp. It was best he not be reminded of all the time he and Sam had spent in it.</p><p>Instead he climbed into the driver’s seat of Lisa’s CRV. Ben hopped into the back seat. As long as Ben had his videogame player he was happy. Lisa took her seat beside Dean.</p><p>“Family vacation, huh?” Lisa said.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m so Chevy Chase right now. Holiddaayy Roooaad,” Dean sung at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“Okay Sparky, let’s go.”</p><p>Dean gunned the engine. Pulling out of the driveway he admired Lisa’s little house; he was hoping that the next time he saw it he would have his brother with him. Maybe they both could stop hunting once and for all, together.</p><h2><span id="chapter-five">CHAPTER FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The Indiana clouds hung low like charcoal smudges wiped against a newsprint-colored sky, threatening rain.</p><p>Sam looked southward. He was twenty miles away from Dean. It would be a short drive—thirty minutes at the very most. Sam could make an excuse, slip away from Samuel and be there at Dean’s front door. He’d embrace him. Sam would tell him he was back, he didn’t know how it had happened, but he was back.</p><p>Sam looked in the direction of Cicero; Dean was there with Lisa. Of course, he knew he should make every effort to see Dean. But strangely he didn’t really want to. Sam wondered what he was feeling: Was it comfort that Dean was safe and finally happy? Was it happiness that he was alive and brought back from the dead? Sam had said “yes” to Lucifer and on that field he fought with every fiber of his being to gain enough control of his own body in order to throw himself into the pit. It seemed that was the last time he felt... anything.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You coming, Sam?”</p><p>Samuel Campbell leaned out of the door of his truck and stared hard at his grandson. Sam always seemed so far off. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Or rather he didn’t want to. He hadn’t ever met the boy before. <span class="italic">Maybe that’s how he always was.</span> Though Samuel couldn’t quite convince himself of that. It was strange how he had found him in the first place, but despite the strange situation and the strange grandson, Sam was family.</p><p>Samuel sighed, the reality of this weird existence hitting him again. Most days he hated waking up. He didn’t think it was a miracle that had brought him back from the dead; there was too paralyzing an ache inside him for this to be a true blessing.</p><p>What bothered Samuel was walking the Earth with the knowledge that his daughter, Mary, was dead. The regret and the loss stung him every day. All he wanted was to see his daughter, her radiant face ringed with blonde hair. She always looked like a cherub to him. He didn’t have the chance to see her grow past the age of twenty-one.</p><p>It’s said that it’s awful for a child to die before a parent, but Samuel thought it was more terrible to come back to life and be told of your child’s death. And to know that she was killed by the same demon that had killed him was even worse. What he would give to go back to 1974 and murder Yellow Eyes! Samuel knew that he should be overjoyed that he could spend time with his grandson. In any regular person’s life dying ten years before your grandchildren are born ordinarily precludes being able to spend time with them—but not if you’re a Campbell.</p><p>“I’m coming!” Sam swung around and got into his grandfather’s truck.</p><p>“Why you dilly-dallying?” Samuel cast Sam a sidewards glance, trying once again to see what was behind that blank stare, but as usual it betrayed nothing. He just had to hope he was getting through to the kid. Much depended on Sam being at his side.</p><p>“You can’t see him, you know that right? It would be dangerous.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “I just wonder how he’s doing.”</p><p>“He’s doing <span class="italic">fine</span>,” Samuel said. They had been over this a half-dozen times since he had met up with his grandson. Dean was happy and the most important thing for Sam to do was to keep hunting. Sam would be putting Dean and his girl’s kid in danger if he contacted them. True or not, that’s what Samuel repeated to him and most of the time it seemed to work.</p><p>Samuel shook his head. Talking to his grandson he sometimes felt as though he was trying to get through to a block of wood. Sam was distant. But it was his inability to be <span class="italic">warm</span> that worried Samuel. He wondered what he had gotten himself into.</p><p>At other times, however, Samuel was outright floored by Sam’s facility for hunting. He had never seen anything like it. In the past couple of months hunting with Sam had proved to be a marvel. Killing werewolves, vampires, and wendigos, even ghost hunting was almost easy with Sam. He intuited the prey’s next move and was there in an instant; the capture or the kill was vicious but surgical. It was as if Sam’s deftness at killing was drawn from some lifeblood deep within him. It almost bordered on the uncanny.</p><p>It was for this reason that Sam had become a leader of sorts to his cousins: Christian, Mark, and Gwen. They were second and third cousins to Sam and a tough trio, an extension of the more scrappy side of the Campbell family tree, and it was no small feat to impress them. But Sam had earned their respect.</p><p>Samuel was impressed with Sam; if pressed he might admit that he was also a little scared of him. But the sheer number of monsters Sam was able to take down required Samuel to look past that. He needed Sam.</p><p>Samuel and Sam headed back toward the compound and pulled into the gated driveway just before dusk. The compound was a collection of industrial and agricultural buildings, strongly fortified with cement and rebar. A good place to take a stand against monsters. It served as an unofficial hunting headquarters for the Campbell family. When Samuel came back from the dead, he took up heading the family and had been sleeping there ever since.</p><p>It turned out he had to stay close to base because things had changed from the days when he was a hunter. There were more monsters than ever before. The needle had been pinging up in the red zone for months. They were on monster overload. Perhaps it was just lucky happenstance, as this was all good news to him. Samuel wanted to hunt as much as possible; he had made a deal that depended on it.</p><h2><span id="chapter-six">CHAPTER SIX</span><a href="#chapter-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Jez, this place is a dump. Though, I <span class="italic">do</span> know a lovely designer who could do wonders with the sparseness of the space. Maybe an Eames lounger or two?”</p><p>Samuel spun around and found himself face to face with Crowley. Crowley was a dandified turd in Samuel’s book, a despicable thing that blighted the earth. Even when Crowley was human, he had to have been an ass.</p><p>But Samuel needed him. He had been playing the demon’s games since he got back and his patience was starting to wear as thin as a crick, but he had to keep going. There was a light at the end of this tunnel—a big light. If Samuel helped Crowley amass a fortune of monster souls, Crowley would bring back Mary.</p><p>“What the hell do you want?” Samuel sneered.</p><p>“I just dropped in for a jelly roll and some of that delicious coffee with powdered milk you have out there.” Crowley motioned to the main space next to Samuel’s office. “No fussing about the nibblets though.” The demon dusted off a chair with his handkerchief. “You and I have some business to attend to.”</p><p>“I think you and I have said all we need to say to one another,” Samuel grunted as he eyed a salt-filled shotgun that was within arm’s reach. How he would love to stick it into Crowley’s mouth and pull the trigger.</p><p>“Don’t even think of blowing me away old man. Then where would you be?” Crowley cackled. Then, as though with the flick of a switch, he turned serious. “You need to have a talk with Dean. You remember him right? Your <span class="italic">other</span> grandson? The one with an actual... heartbeat? I know, I know. Dean’s just a regular old human so you might not have any use for him. But I need you to talk to him.”</p><p>“You know I can’t do that. There is no way I can do that,” Samuel said firmly.</p><p><span class="italic">“How</span> you do it is not my problem. Just that you <span class="italic">do</span> it. Dean has a funny little idea in his head and you have to make sure he doesn’t go through with it.” Crowley crossed and uncrossed his legs as he spoke.</p><p>“How do you know?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“You don’t need to know that. Only that I do. He thinks he’s going to be able to raise Sam from the dead using a pisser of an old text.”</p><p>Samuel realized immediately what Crowley was getting at.</p><p>“The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>?” he exclaimed. It hadn’t occurred to Samuel before but now that he thought about it, that book <span class="italic">could</span> cause them some trouble. In the wrong hands, the wrong spell would raise Lucifer. <span class="italic">Those boys would do just about</span> <span class="italic">anything for one another,</span> thought Samuel. <span class="italic">I guess that does run in the family.</span></p><p>Crowley’s voice cut through his thoughts.</p><p>“Look here, mate, you and I are wearing the same jersey, yes? So just make sure that Deany-boy doesn’t get his hands on that one tiny little spell. Because let me tell you, that would be a crapstorm of epic proportions. There is a chance that spell, with enough battery power behind it, could actually raise Lucifer in whatever state he’s in. If that old boy gets loose again... Well then, all bets are off between you and me. Understand?”</p><p>“How am I going to stop him? I can’t control what he does.”</p><p>“No, but you can control who he has access too. So make sure he doesn’t get his hands on that book.” Crowley stood. “I’m a little grumpy that I have to keep repeating meself,” he added, moving so he standing nose to nose with Samuel. “Just do what I tell you to do. Okay?”</p><p>The demon’s cold breath stung Samuel’s face.</p><p>“Fine,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Well, good. I’m just chuffed to bits.” Crowley stepped back, all light and breezy again. “This went well. As always, I enjoy your company Samuel. It’s nice to have another old fella about.”</p><p>If Samuel had been up on the latest ways to tell Crowley where to stick it he would have, but since he wasn’t, he stayed silent. Crowley smiled, and in an instant he was gone.</p><p>Samuel plopped down into a chair. He hated that guy, almost as much as he hated Yellow Eyes.</p><p>“Oops, one more thing!” Crowley suddenly reappeared, so close Samuel couldn’t even stand up. The demon leaned over him while tapping on the crystal of his watch. “Dean is taking the fam’ on a little vacay to Salem, Massachusetts. You understand the implications?” Crowley cocked his head questioningly.</p><p>“I have to follow him,” Samuel said solemnly.</p><p>“Smart man. No wonder you’re the patriarch of this cursed and screwed clan.” Crowley patted Samuel on the cheek with his palm. “You’re taking a road trip. Chafed ass, corn nuts, having to hold your pee for fifty miles. Such fun. Get your fanny-pack.” And with that the demon disappeared again.</p><p>“Damn it.” Samuel pinched his brow. Then he called out, “Sam! Sam!”</p><p>A few moments later, his grandson opened up the steel door of Samuel’s office. His bulk almost filled the entire seven-foot doorframe.</p><p>“Yeah?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have to go. Reconnaissance mission,” Samuel said, hefting himself out of the chair and toward the wall that served as his mini-armory.</p><p>“For what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have to follow Dean,” Samuel said.</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“Because he’s...” Samuel trailed off. He didn’t know if he should tell Sam that Dean was trying to resurrect him. Would that cause Sam undue pain to see his brother manically searching for a way to bring him back from the dead? Samuel wasn’t sure. Sam was so cold and calculating, it was hard to know how he would react. But reconnaissance wasn’t a good enough carrot on a string for Sam, he had to pique the boy’s hunting instincts.</p><p>“Witches,” Samuel said firmly. “We have to find some witches.”</p><p>“What does that have to do with Dean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“He’s after them too, and we need to get there first.”</p><p>“What are they doing? I mean, they’re kind of small fry compared to the monsters we’ve been hunting.”</p><p>“They’re trying to create monsters. Just trust me. We could pull in the motherload with this one.” Samuel was peeved he needed to give any explanation at all. “Go tell the others they’re on their own for a few days—and you and I are going to need the van.”</p><p>Sam shrugged and left the room. It was hunting—that was all that mattered to him.</p><p>Outside he stared out across the fields that surrounded the camp. He wondered why he felt disconnected from the thought of following his brother. Was it for the same reason that, though there was a breeze, he couldn’t feel it on his face? Did it have to do with the fact that he hadn’t slept since he got back? And though he had been eating, as sort of a facade so he wouldn’t freak the others out, he hadn’t been hungry. Not even once. Did it have to do with that?</p><p>And that other feeling Sam remembered having—when he and Dean would come out alive after a particularly nasty battle, or the first time he saw Dean after his brother had been pulled out of Hell—what was that feeling? Because Sam didn’t have that feeling anymore. Not about anything.</p><h2><span id="chapter-seven">CHAPTER SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The only thing Sam <span class="italic">did</span> feel was the intense need to hunt. It was almost as if an animal within him had woken up. He could literally <span class="italic">feel</span> the move a monster was about to make, and be there before it was. Sam was singular in his drive. Hunt. It was as if he no longer needed to intellectualize the right and wrong of it. All he cared about was getting the monster. For this reason Sam really was Samuel’s perfect weapon. Except Sam’s new nature wasn’t without its dangers.</p><p>Three weeks ago he and Samuel had been hunting down a monster that had taken up residence in a halfway house full of recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. The local paper had covered a murder-suicide and another unexplained death at the house. Police thought the deaths were due to the unsavory characters of the residents, most of whom had been in and out of jail or had some type of police record, but Sam knew better. He talked his grandfather into going with him to investigate.</p><p>The next morning they arrived at the door of the facility posing as priests.</p><p>“May I help you?” A short-haired, round woman answered the door.</p><p>“Bless you, child. I’m Father Tipton,” Sam introduced himself, “and this is Father Halford. We’re with the Cumberland County Prayer Outreach Center. We were hoping to come and help your residents in their time of need. Two deaths in three weeks. Terrible.”</p><p>The woman assented with a pudgy-cheeked smile. She introduced herself as Beverley and led them into a meeting room, where they talked her into letting them take a look around the house.</p><p>Seeing that each room was outfitted with a floor grate, their first thought was that the monster had been moving from room to room through the heating system. But the grates were wrought iron. Since ghosts can’t pass through iron and demons don’t like to either, they were confused. What was it? There was no way to be sure. Sam proposed they act as bait.</p><p>With a little persuasion, they were allowed to stay the night.</p><p>“I’ll stay up. You go to bed,” Sam said to his grandfather. He and Samuel had been given a room to share in the halfway house.</p><p>“Naw, I’m fine,” Samuel said, though Sam could see he looked tired.</p><p>“Okay, just saying. I don’t need much sleep.”</p><p>“Right. Maybe I’ll just shut my eyes,” Samuel said, relenting. He lay back on the bed and moments later his breathing slowed and he began to snore gently.</p><p>Sam held his salt-packed shotgun in his lap and stared into space, waiting.</p><p>Then he heard it. A deep moan from the bowels of the house, as if someone was trapped within the walls, trying to get out.</p><p>Without waking his grandfather, Sam crept out into the hallway. The residents’ rooms were all located off the upstairs corridor.</p><p>A door slammed. Sam whipped around, but didn’t move an inch further. He listened again, and heard the same moaning noise. Sam peered into the gloom at the end of the hallway. A grey mass appeared out of nowhere and gradually took shape in the dirty dark.</p><p>Sam trained his shotgun on the specter, but in a blink it was gone.</p><p>Sam ran down the corridor to the spot where the thing had been. There was no heating grate, no nothing—nowhere for it to go. Above him a single bulb flickered. He moved to touch it, but the bulb suddenly got brighter and brighter until it popped.</p><p>The thin shards of glass broke in Sam’s face. He calmly picked them out of his skin with his fingernail.</p><p>Down the hallway underneath a door, Sam saw a light. He moved toward it and kicked open the door. A girl, about his age, stared at him, her mouth open in a silent scream.</p><p>Without hesitation, Sam spun around and aimed his gun at the ceiling above him.</p><p>BLAM!</p><p>The shot missed the creature as it dropped on top of Sam.</p><p><span class="italic">A shtriga,</span> he realized. Sam struggled but the shtriga stuck its putrid face into his, and started to suck. It pulled, its beetle-black eyes rolling into its head. But there was something wrong, nothing was happening, no soul was being sucked out of Sam.</p><p>Sam smiled and with his right arm aimed the gun at the monster’s head. The shtriga avoided the shot and skidded up the wall, still facing its unbeatable prey. Sam aimed again but it was gone.</p><p>The girl on the bed finally let out a nails-on-a-chalk-board scream.</p><p>“Shut up,” Sam barked.</p><p>She did, cowering back away from Sam. Sam opened the bedroom door, but despite the screams and gunshots, the house was silent. He flicked the light switch.</p><p>“Don’t do that. It might come back! What if it—“ the girl squealed.</p><p>“What did I say?” Sam spat. She shut up again.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. There were twenty people in the house. It was the perfect place for a shtriga to feed—beaten-down people who had given up on life. Easy prey. Like the shtrigas’ taste for children.</p><p>Sam crept back into the room where Samuel still slept; somehow the noise further down the corridor had failed to wake him.</p><p>Sam quickly loaded a couple of iron bullets into his gun—the only thing guaranteed to work on a shtriga. Then he turned out the light and leaned over his grandfather.</p><p>Sam knew the monster would be attracted to a body that wouldn’t put up too much of a fight. He took a pillow from underneath his grandfather’s head. He held it over Samuel’s face and lightly pushed down. He needed to slow Samuel’s breathing enough so that the shtriga would be drawn to his body, on the brink of dying. Samuel’s eyes popped open. He struggled against Sam, but his strength was no match for his grandson’s and in moments Samuel was unconscious.</p><p>Sam released the pillow and checked Samuel’s pulse—it was weakened, but still there. He was fine. Sam then got down on his hands and knees and shimmied underneath the bed.</p><p>A few seconds later, the lamp on the nightstand started to flicker and the air filled with a heavy weight. From his position, Sam could only see a foot of space between the floor and the underbelly of the bed.</p><p>Slowly, the dripping grey matter of the shtriga appeared, fluttering a couple of inches above the floor. It was singularly focused on the unconscious old man lying on the mattress above.</p><p>Sam heard the shtriga’s large mouth open, followed by a hollow sucking. Samuel gurgled. The life was slowly being drained from him. Sam silently pushed his way to the opposite side of the bed, and pulled himself into a crouch. With his finger poised on the trigger, he sprang up from the floor and fired.</p><p>The shtriga emitted a high-pitched, inhuman scream as the iron bullet exploded through the top of its head. Dusty rag-like pieces stuck to the wall behind it. The body fell on top of Samuel.</p><p>“Ahhhhh!” Samuel coughed as he sat up. “What the hell did you do?”</p><p>“Used you as bait. Had to,” Sam replied.</p><p>He stood up and threw the monster’s body off Samuel’s legs.</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>“I used you as bait. Had to slow down your heart rate to make you weaker, so it would be attracted to you.” Sam put the shotgun away.</p><p>“Not only did you kill the damn thing, but you almost killed me in the process!” Samuel spluttered, glaring at his grandson.</p><p>“I just wanted to kill it. I knew it would go after you. You weren’t in any danger.”</p><p>“Fathers?” Beverly stood in curlers and a bathrobe at the doorway to the room.</p><p>Sam shoved past her.</p><p>“All set here. The souls of your residents are all saved.”</p><p>“But what is that?” Beverly asked, pointing at the splattered body of the shtriga.</p><p>“Dead cat,” Samuel said, flashing her a cursory smile. “Sorry about that. The church will cover the clean-up costs. Thanks for letting us stay.”</p><p>Samuel moved past her and followed Sam out the door.</p><p>Sam thought about how many miles he had traveled with Dean. Thousands, millions. He didn’t know. He didn’t care. All Sam wanted was to get to Salem and take out as many witches as Samuel told him to.</p><p>It made perfect sense to him that witches would be creating monsters. It seemed like there were a lot more of them around these days. Old Sam would have wanted to know why there were more monsters. New Sam just liked hunting them. Old Sam wouldn’t have almost killed his grandfather to gank a monster. New Sam, it didn’t faze him much. According to his grandfather, he had messed up. He moved on. He didn’t feel guilty about it like old Sam would have.</p><p>Sam did remember having that feeling, guilt. A sick aching in his stomach, a flutter in his heart that would make him tremble and go weak. Guilt was an awful feeling, and being with Dean those past couple of years he had felt it <span class="italic">constantly.</span> Now, Sam didn’t have that feeling any longer. He was free. Free to run after something, kill it and then move on. He was no longer tied to the push and pull of his mind and heart, weighing whether what he was doing was right or wrong. Instinct was the only feeling that was driving him.</p><p>THRUMP. THRUMP. THRUMP. Sam drove the van as his grandfather slept in the back. The road stretched out before him. Truth be told, he liked being without his brother. Hunting. Sam only wanted to hunt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eight">CHAPTER EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>As Sam drove, he thought back to three months before.</p><p>He lay on the cold grassy ground looking up at the gray sky above him. A cold sensation was shooting from his back around his spine, and invading him through his blood. He was dizzy, as if someone was pushing him on one of those spinning carousels in a playground. His entire body hummed like a thousand tuning forks were being held to his bones. He tried to move his fingers, but wasn’t sure if he was able.</p><p>Thirty minutes went by before he could roll off his back and sit up. All around him the grass was scorched black and flattened by the epic fight between the two powerful angels. Everything was super bright, his eyes burned.</p><p>A car drove past on the nearest road, the sound startling him. He realized his ears were still ringing. He had no clue how long he had been gone. Or how he’d got out.</p><p>He pulled his shirt off his shoulder—but there wasn’t a hand-mark on him like Dean had had when he was brought back by Castiel. He didn’t have a bruise or a scratch on him. How had this happened? The last thing he remembered was jumping into the pit, and then a soul-searing pain. That was it.</p><p>He stumbled out of Stull Cemetery disoriented and alone. He headed north and hit Route 70. A big rig had picked him up and offered him a ride down the road to Topeka. Once in Topeka he had realized he wanted to check on one thing.</p><p>Sam caught the date on a flat-screen TV in a coffee shop and realized he hadn’t been gone for very long at all.</p><p>Though not much time had passed, there was a profound difference in the way Sam felt. Namely—great. He felt like his legs had a strange sense of purpose, like they were more self-assured. He held his body differently, he felt stronger, broader, more vital. Yes, there was definitely a difference in Sam.</p><p>He quickly realized the potential of his situation; he could be anyone, do anything. No one was waiting for him any longer; there was no one to tell him he was messing everything up—again. No one to tell him that he couldn’t do something or that he wasn’t living up to what was expected of him.</p><p>Like Dean.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Sam felt free. But he needed to check and make sure. For that reason, he went to Lisa Braeden’s house and confirmed that Dean had shown up. He saw Dean, glass of Scotch in hand, sitting at the dinner table and Sam knew this was how it should be. Dean should be in there, and he should be outside. In the world. A new person.</p><p>It took him two days to get new credit cards and pick up a new Dodge Charger courtesy of some falsified loan documents. Sam didn’t want to go to any of their old haunts so he found a different black market, a small brick warehouse on the south side of Chicago, where he purchased a couple of unregistered guns. Sam knew what he had been brought back for. He was here to hunt. There was an ache inside him and he knew exactly what food to feed it: pure, unadulterated hate.</p><p>Sam holed up in a crappy motel with a new computer, he guessed Dean had kept his old one, and started combing the local news.</p><p>He stayed up all night, meticulously looking at each picayune site. And then he found an interesting little titbit. A whole spate of cow mutilations in a small town in North Dakota. Every animal was found drained of blood, the throat ripped out, but there weren’t any signs of tire tracks or animal prints. Could be a werewolf, or something cryptozoological. Whatever, it was a case.</p><p>Sam started his investigation by examining the dozens of comments on the news site. Just about all of them complained that the new sheriff, Sheriff Littlefoot, wasn’t doing anything to help the local ranchers. They blamed his inaction on him being an out-of-towner who didn’t understand the town’s need for answers.</p><p>Sam roared into town in his Charger, sussed out which ranchers had been victimized and swiftly interviewed them. Not that it told him much. The hard-working, hard-living ranchers were fed up with guys in offices not doing anything for them. They needed answers.</p><p>Posing as a park ranger, Sam rented a four-wheeler and went out to the site of the mutilations. The sky was big and the plains were wide. Even as he stood knee-deep in cow intestines, for the first time in a long time Sam felt he was <span class="italic">enjoying</span> his life.</p><p>That night Sam kept vigil on a barstool in the local saloon. He had been eyeing the cute waitress in the jean-skirt all night. She had given him a couple of glances, but nothing that told him she was interested. That was, until closing time rolled around.</p><p>Sam had downed what he thought was a good amount of beer, but he was as lucid and sober as he’d ever been. Her name was Jodi, and Sam chatted with her as she closed out her night and counted her cash tips. They shared another drink and then Sam invited her back to his motel room.</p><p>Sam was amazed. It was usually Dean who bagged the chicks. Sam had never had much of a taste for it. But something had changed. He enjoyed himself. In fact, it was the best sex of his life. And he didn’t understand why. The girl was cute, but by no means would you stop the car to look at her. She had a good body, but it wasn’t like she was a keeper. Sam couldn’t understand what had changed, until he realized that emotionally—he felt nothing.</p><p>He didn’t feel bad about leading her on and telling her that he had a new job in town and was looking to settle down with the “right girl.” He didn’t feel bad when he lied and said, yeah, he thought she was beautiful. He didn’t feel anything but pure physical pleasure. No guilt. Usually, if he had sex with a girl, he would immediately think of Jessica and the moment would be ruined. But now: nothing. No guilt. It was the most free he had ever felt in his life.</p><p>But more pressing things demanded his attention. He was pretty sure there was a werewolf in town somewhere. The question was—where?</p><p>The next morning he decided to visit the infamous Sheriff Littlefoot, posing as a fed this time, so as to outrank him. Sam walked into the sheriff’s dimly lit office. The metal blinds were cinched shut and made it difficult to see. The sheriff was a tall man of Native American descent. He was handsome but had grown paunchy around the middle.</p><p>“Mind if I open these up?” Sam said, moving toward the windows.</p><p>“Actually, I do. Sorry, stigmatism in my eye. Doctor says it’s best to keep the light low.”</p><p>“I’ve never heard that before,” Sam said as he made himself comfortable and let the Sheriff sweat a bit.</p><p>The Sheriff ran through the usual nervous questions and answers a small-town law officer asks when a federal agent is in their jurisdiction. “What was this about?” “These things happen all the time in ranching areas, it’s just wild animals.” “I’ve seen this a million times before and it’s usually over-active imaginations.”</p><p>Sam listened, then asked to look at the files and if the Sheriff would mind if he stopped by at his house to drop them off later.</p><p>The sheriff resisted, saying, “Me, my wife, and the boy might be having dinner.”</p><p>Sam assured him that he wouldn’t interfere, he just wanted to get the files back in the sheriff’s hands as soon as possible.</p><p>That afternoon, Sam sat outside the sheriff’s house until the evening. It was a nice neighborhood; kids played in the streets, mothers pushed baby carriages. Sam registered this and continued to gaze intently at the sheriff’s house. But the small clapboard house was silent all afternoon, the curtains drawn tight.</p><p>About seven in the evening, when the sun had gone down, and the prairies surrounding the town gave off a silver sheen, the lights inside the house clicked on, and the sheriff’s little boy came out to play for the first time all day.</p><p>Shortly thereafter the sheriff came home. Sam slid low in his seat. The sheriff gathered up his son and went inside.</p><p>Sam took out one of his new guns and made sure it was loaded with a silver bullet and then approached the house. As he got closer a sickening baying came from inside. Sam tried to peek through the window but the curtains were still drawn. He needed to find another way in.</p><p>On other side of the house, Sam pushed open the small bathroom window. Through the open doorway and down a hallway he could make out the faint outline of a regular living room, complete with a small TV and worn couches.</p><p>Sam silently hoisted himself in through the window and crept across the room. Across the hallway there was another, smaller parlor and behind that the kitchen. The baying stopped. Sam thought he could hear the slick, wet sound of teeth pulling flesh apart.</p><p>Pressed against the wall, he edged down the corridor until he was on the other side of the kitchen door. Sam knew he was going to have to act quickly.</p><p>Just as he was about to kick the door open, the sound of breaking glass crackled from somewhere in the house.</p><p>A chair scraped—someone was getting up in the kitchen to investigate the sound. Sam needed a way out.</p><p>He ran up the stairs, and pushed open the first door he came to. He hid in what looked like the kid’s bedroom. He waited a short while, then crept back down the stairs. Outside the kitchen door he drew in his breath, readied his gun then—</p><p>“This is my hunt, boy,” a voice whispered.</p><h2><span id="chapter-nine">CHAPTER NINE</span><a href="#chapter-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam spun around and came face to face with a man who looked very much like his grandfather. Sam had only seen Samuel in pictures, but the resemblance was unmistakable—though in the earlier photos Samuel had a lot more hair.</p><p>Sam’s face fell. He looked at the kitchen doorway on the other side of which he assumed there was a family of very hungry werewolves, then back at his long-dead grandfather.</p><p>Samuel leaned in and whispered in Sam’s ear, “Hope that’s not a silver bullet in there. The little one is a Native American god—you’ll need something else to kill it.”</p><p>Sam looked at his grandfather and then inclining his head to indicate the other man should follow him, he silently slipped out the front door.</p><p>Once outside, he checked to make sure his grandfather was behind and retreated a little way down the block. Then Sam turned and took a good look at the other man. No question, it <span class="italic">had</span> to be Samuel Campbell. He was broad and in good shape, and most definitely alive. But it soon became clear that Samuel had no idea who Sam was.</p><p>“Why you edging onto my hunt?” Samuel demanded. “Who sent you? Did Mark and Gwen think I couldn’t handle this myself? Jesus H. Christ, I’ve hunted for two lifetimes more than them, and they still coddle me like an invalid.”</p><p>“Hold on. I didn’t expect anyone else up here with me,” Sam protested.</p><p>“Well, obviously neither did I,” Samuel retorted.</p><p>“We can probably clear this up pretty quick,” Sam continued. “I’m John.”</p><p>“Well, John, nice to meet you. I’m Samuel Campbell.” Sam’s long-dead grandfather held out his hand.</p><p>Sam shook it, and smiled gainfully. He didn’t know who was pulling what but he wasn’t going to get caught in Hell again. In an instant, he raised the barrel of his sawed-off and cracked Samuel in the nose. Samuel dropped onto one knee holding his face, blood dripping onto the sidewalk. A couple out for an evening stroll quickly reversed their direction.</p><p>Sam pulled out a flask of holy water, grabbed Samuel’s chin and forced it down his throat. Samuel choked a bit, but he certainly wasn’t smoking from the inside out. The old man tried to get up but Sam kicked his legs out from underneath him. Samuel fell heavily onto the ground.</p><p>He was still trying to staunch his bloody nose when Sam grabbed him again and sliced his forearm with a silver knife. No sizzling.</p><p>“Jesus Christ! What the hell are you doing?” Samuel cried.</p><p>“You’re supposed to be dead,” Sam said, aiming his gun between Samuel’s eyes. “So you’re either an angel, a demon, or something in between. Which is it?”</p><p>“Jesus, boy. How do you know that?”</p><p>“Know what?” Sam said.</p><p>“How do you know I’m supposed to be dead?” Samuel said, pushing himself off the ground, while still trying to stop the bleeding from his nose and forearm.</p><p>Sam hesitated.</p><p>“Because you’re my grandfather,” he said eventually.</p><p>Samuel looked into Sam’s eyes. “Sam?”</p><p>“Dean told you about me?”</p><p>“Dean told me <span class="italic">all</span> about you; Stanford, your girlfriend, what a great hunter you are.”</p><p>“Dean said that?” Sam asked, truly skeptical that his brother would have complimented him.</p><p>“He said that you have a good head on your shoulders. You’re fast, but mostly people trust you. Kind face, I guess. You’re the brains, the yin to Dean’s yang.”</p><p><span class="italic">That’s one way to put it,</span> Sam thought. “Yeah, well, he never told me that.”</p><p>“Where is he anyway?” Samuel asked. “I thought you guys were a team.”</p><p>“Yeah, um, not anymore. Dean decided to pack it in and settle down with his girlfriend.”</p><p>“Girlfriend? Really? Well, that’s wonderful. I would love to see him,” Samuel said. “But of course, things are a little different now. You know since... I’ve come back.”</p><p>“Yeah, how did that happened?” Sam asked. He needed to know. Two people from the same family being resurrected, one from a cage in Hell—surely it couldn’t be a coincidence.</p><p>“No idea. Woke up in a field somewhere. I called my niece—she was the only one I could think of that would be young enough to be alive—and she took me in. She was hunting. Met the group that she hunts with. Just sort of fell back into it.”</p><p>Samuel pulled Sam in for a hug.</p><p>“It’s great to meet you, son.”</p><p>Sam pushed him away. Enough of this family reunion crap, it was time to get back to business.</p><p>“So the kid is a god?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah. No need to kill the kid though, just chase the god out,” Samuel explained. “He’s the incarnation of Malsum. It’s an Algonquin Cain and Abel story. The incarnation of Malsum comes every generation, takes the form of a wolf and mostly mutilates cattle as a kind of trick.”</p><p>“So you weren’t there to kill him?”</p><p>“Not at all. It’s just killing cattle, not people. We have to chase the god out while it’s in the wolf form, not as a child.”</p><p>“Then why were you sneaking into the house?”</p><p>“I was going to hide under the bed until he changed, then use this on him.” Samuel held up an elaborate bone and herb garland. “Wrap it around his neck, say a prayer three times and it’s supposed to send Malsum back to the dark world.”</p><p>“Let’s just wait in the car then. If he moves, we’ll get him,” Sam proposed.</p><p>They sat in Sam’s car for another hour or two. Sam wasn’t in the mood for talking, but after thirty-odd years of being dead, it seemed his grandfather had plenty of questions. Sam responded as politely as he could, but he kept to himself the fact that he had been Lucifer’s chosen vessel and had taken Lucifer on and jumped into the pit.</p><p>At around ten in the evening, the Sheriff’s little boy appeared on the front doorstep. Sam and Samuel hunkered down in their seats as the Sheriff and his wife carefully peered up and down the street. They then ceremonially kissed the child on each cheek and handed him what looked like a small snack. The child turned his back on his parents and in an instant turned into a silver wolf.</p><p>“But the god is a bad god, right?” Sam whispered.</p><p>“I guess so. He’s Cain,” his grandfather replied.</p><p>“Good,” Sam said. He got out of the car with his shotgun drawn. The Sheriff looked up, saw Sam, and yelled at the wolf to run. The wolf glanced at Sam and took off across the street and over the prairie beyond.</p><p>Sam was almost as quick. He ran swiftly after the creature, leaving his grandfather far behind.</p><p>The wolf leapt over a twelve-foot-wide irrigation ditch and kept going. Sam jumped, but hit the ground a little short, sliding down the embankment. But moments later, he found his footing and raced up the hill back onto the prairie. The wolf was far ahead now, so Sam leveled his gun and shot. The silver wolf went down.</p><p>Satisfied, Sam approached his victim. The creature was breathing heavily, blood draining from the back of its leg out onto the dry ground.</p><p>“What did you do?” Samuel yelled breathlessly as he reached Sam’s side.</p><p>“Give me the wreath, you say the prayer,” Sam directed.</p><p>Samuel did as his grandson said. Sam wrapped the herbs around the wolf’s neck as Samuel said the prayer three times.</p><p>The wolf lifted its head one last time then laid it back down on the ground.</p><p>“You killed him, Sam. You killed a <span class="italic">child,”</span> Samuel said. “What is wrong with you? <span class="italic">You don’t kill people!”</span></p><p>Sam looked down impassively at the wolf then unwrapped the herbs and bones from its neck. The body of the wolf disappeared and in its place was the young black-haired boy.</p><p>Silently, Sam scooped him up. The boy’s breathing was faint. Sam strode rapidly back across the prairie to the Sheriff’s house, put the child in his father’s arms, then got into the car. His grandfather was waiting in the passenger seat. Still without speaking, Sam started the engine and sped onto the highway.</p><p>Eventually Samuel broke the silence.</p><p>“You shot a boy,” he said.</p><p>“I killed a nasty god. The boy will be fine,” Sam replied. He gripped the wheel.</p><p>“The fact that you could have killed him means nothing to you? Who taught you that?”</p><p>“No one did. I did what needed to be done,” Sam said, staring at the road.</p><p>“What happened to you, boy?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I was sent to Hell.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-ten">CHAPTER TEN</span><a href="#chapter-ten" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The rhythmic thrumming of the tires over the cracks in the Eisenhower-era road lulled Dean into a reverie. This stretch of sun-baked cement was like the thousands of miles Dean had logged with Sam at his side. Dean’s mind swerved again toward that afternoon at Stull Cemetery. He gripped the steering wheel tight and tried to forget. But like an unbalanced axle, he slowly got pulled to the side that his mind favored—Dean thought back to the days before Sam jumped.</p><p>“For the record, I agree with you. About... me. You think I’m too weak to take on Lucifer. Well, so do I. I know exactly how screwed-up I am. You, Bobby, Cass—I’m the least of any of you,” Sam said earnestly. They’d had this conversation multiple times and each time Dean had said, “No.” He wasn’t going to let Sam say “Yes.”</p><p>“Sam—“ Dean began, but he didn’t know how to carry on. His brother wasn’t the least of them. He’d just taken one too many turns for the worse over the last two years: he had drunk demon blood, shacked up with Ruby, let Lucifer out of the cage. Dean couldn’t deny that Sam had messed up. But who on Earth could take on Lucifer? Dean just couldn’t bear to see his brother killed.</p><p>Sam continued. “It’s true. I’m also all we got. If there was another way... But I don’t think there is. There’s just me. So I don’t know what else to do. Except just try to do what’s gotta be done.”</p><p>And then Dean had lied to Death’s face; told him he would let Sam jump.</p><p>When Dean spoke to Bobby later, he was surprised to find that Bobby agreed with Sam.</p><p>“Look, I’m not sayin’ Sam ain’t ass-full of character defects. But—“</p><p>“But what?” Dean asked curtly.</p><p>“Back at Niveus? I watched that kid pull out one civilian after another. Must have saved ten people. Never stopped, never slowed down. We’re hard on him, Dean. And we’ve always been.”</p><p>Dean knew that Bobby was right: At his core—his very core where his heart beat—Sam was a good person.</p><p>“So I gotta ask you, Dean. What are you afraid of exactly? Losing—or losing your brother?”</p><p>Lisa had become accustomed to that look in Dean’s eyes. She had deliberately overlooked the history of Salem, the witch trials and all the supernatural activity they promised, when Dean mentioned it as his planned vacation spot for them.</p><p><span class="italic">A vacation in Salem is better than no vacation at all,</span> she reasoned. <span class="italic">And a change of scenery is good. He will be okay. This will be okay.</span> She forced herself to ignore the feeling that perhaps Dean wasn’t telling her the whole story.</p><p>“New York State! Just crossed into New York, Ben. Ben, you listening?” Dean said, checking the rearview.</p><p>“Whatever.” Ben glanced up from his handheld PSP. “It looks exactly like the last state.”</p><p>“Ben,” Lisa said, giving him a motherly warning to not act out.</p><p>Ben heeded his mother’s tone.</p><p>“It’s cool. Very cool,” he said, clearly trying to sound more enthusiastic.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said with a smile. “Seven more hours and we’re there.”</p><p>“Seven more? Are you sure you’re okay to keep driving? Shall I take over for a while?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m fine. Better than fine,” Dean said. And he was. The closer they got to Salem the closer he got to finding someone to help him raise Sam. Dean was focused on one thing and one thing only—getting his brother back.</p><p>“Dean,” Lisa chided, “I know you can spend days straight in a car, but Ben and I can’t. We need to stretch our legs and it’s almost nine. Ben needs to go to bed.”</p><p>“I can sleep back here,” Ben offered.</p><p>“A proper bed. Please Dean, can we stop?”</p><p>Dean looked at Lisa. He didn’t want to stop, he wasn’t used to staggering journeys and waiting around. He just wanted to get to Salem. But he had other people to consider on this trip, it wasn’t just him and Sam, driving through the night to another hunt. He was supposed to be on vacation.</p><p>“Sure, no problem. Next town or rest stop, we’ll find a room. Okay?”</p><p>“Thanks,” Lisa said, putting her hand on Dean’s arm.</p><p>An hour later they pulled off the highway and into a little one-street town. Dean stopped the car in front of the only hotel he could see. It had a Western-style feel to it even though they were in western New York State, not Arizona.</p><p>“You check in, I’ll drive park around back,” Dean suggested.</p><p>Lisa and Ben hopped out and Dean pulled the car left, back into the street.</p><p>SCRREEECH!</p><p>Dean stomped on the breaks as a white van careened out of nowhere and past the car.</p><p>“Jesus H. Christ, Sam! You think you could maybe not hit your brother’s car while you’re still pretending to be dead,” Samuel spat.</p><p>Sam had pulled off Route 86 a couple of minutes after Dean. He hadn’t been following him the whole time, but had spotted the car halfway through Ohio. Samuel had said that they should follow Dean and keep an eye on him. If they got to Salem before him, they risked losing him or worse, being spotted.</p><p>“It’s that damn Daddy Caddy. Dean never drove like that in the Impala,” Sam said, scowling.</p><p>He held his course and pulled the van into the parking lot of a park a couple of blocks from Dean’s motel.</p><p>“Let’s get the MREs and hit the road right after them in the a.m.,” Samuel said.</p><p>Sam ate his Ready-to-Eat meal sitting on a picnic table while his grandfather sorted through their equipment in the open back of the van.</p><p>Sam looked out over a buzzing little park pond, he liked doing everything himself these days and he didn’t feel the need for company. As much as he trusted his grandfather, he trusted himself more.</p><p>Sam bit into a hard foil-wrapped brownie. It was tasteless to him, or maybe it was just tasteless. It didn’t matter. The only hint of a feeling Sam could really understand was satisfaction. He liked getting a job done. He thought about Dean only a couple of blocks away. Whatever Dean was after, if they had to get there first and do it better, that was fine by Sam.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eleven">CHAPTER ELEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-eleven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The next day Dean, Lisa, and Ben were on the road early. They stopped at a fast food drive-through for breakfast and then were on their way. Four hours later Dean finally pulled off the interstate.</p><p>“Here we are. This looks good enough,” Dean said as he angled the car into a Sunshine Inn parking lot. It was located off a bleak mall and gas station-stuffed suburban thruway.</p><p>“Oh Dean, I forgot to tell you,” Lisa said, with a slight smirk. “I made reservations at this cute bed and breakfast in the heart of town. Here’s the address.” She handed him a piece of paper printed out from the Internet. “I think if you pull out of here, take a right, and then take your next right at Waters Street, that will take us right into town.” Lisa gestured the route Dean was to take.</p><p>Dean stared hard at the piece of paper. Reservations? He’d never made reservations before. <span class="italic">For anything.</span></p><p>“What’s wrong with this place?” Dean said, even though he knew full well the rooms inside were most likely witch-themed, dirty, and smelled of old cigarettes.</p><p>“Dean, please. It’s our <span class="italic">vacation.</span> I wanted to stay somewhere nice.” Lisa turned her mouth into a little pout. She hated resorting to female trickery—but she wasn’t going to stay in a flea-bag hotel.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “How can I say no to that face?”</p><p>In the back seat Ben rolled his eyes and slumped further down.</p><p>“Gross,” he mumbled.</p><p>Dean did as he was told and followed the directions into Salem proper. The town was a nice old colonial village with tree-lined streets and lots of federal-style brick houses with flat fronts, colonnade porches, and small windows. But commercialism and chains had grown like weeds and it was clear that the town didn’t shy away from its dark past; in fact it did everything it could to capitalize on it.</p><p>They found the bed and breakfast easily enough, across the street from a big grassy expanse called Salem Common.</p><p>“Is that where they hanged the witches?” Ben asked, putting aside his video player and looking out of the window.</p><p>“No, actually they hanged the witches on a hill on the southwest side of town,” Dean replied. “A place called Gallows Hill, though they’re not sure of the exact location. Of course, none of the people they hanged actually were witches.” Dean’s voice betrayed a slight hint of having too much relish in the topic. Lisa shot him a look.</p><p>“That’s cool. Can we go see it?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Of course. Do you know anything about the Salem witch trials?” Dean asked as he parallel parked the CRV into a too-tight space.</p><p>“Not much, a little in school.”</p><p>“Well then, I have lots to show you,” Dean said.</p><p>They piled out of the car and Dean grabbed most of the bags. He wasn’t used to actual luggage, he and Sam always traveled light, one duffle bag a piece at the very most. Now Dean really did feel and look like Chevy Chase.</p><p>The inside of the inn was tastefully decorated in a display-everything-your-grandma-likes kind of way. But Lisa didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>“Hello, hello. You must be the Winchesters. I’m Ingrid,” the tall middle-aged proprietor chimed from behind the inn’s counter.</p><p>“Yes, we are. I made a reservation for two adjoining rooms,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Aww, I can stay in a room by myself,” Ben grumbled.</p><p>“Sure you can, buddy,” Dean said, looking at Lisa. Dean and Sam had stayed in hotel rooms by themselves since they were seven. Ben was twelve, he could handle that.</p><p>“No, he can’t,” Lisa said.</p><p>Ben mumbled under his breath, then crossed the foyer to sit in a high-backed chair near the door.</p><p>“Two adjoining rooms will be fine,” Lisa said, turning back to Ingrid with a smile.</p><p>“Great. Would you also like to schedule one of our ghost tours? We offer a full paranormal tour of our inn. We’re the only inn on the East Coast with our own ghosts!”</p><p>“Your own ghosts?” Dean said, eyebrow raised.</p><p>Lisa paled. “Oh Dean, I didn’t know!”</p><p>“We’re the most popular inn on the square,” Ingrid continued proudly. “People come from all over to take our spooky ghost tour and meet our otherworldly residents. There is Sally, the little girl who lost her bonnet. And Captain Chancy, who fell asleep and never woke up. He still thinks it’s 1697 and he’s sailing the high seas!”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said flatly. It was so not great.</p><p>“We can go somewhere else,” Lisa murmured quietly to Dean.</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Dean said. The spooks sounded harmless enough—if they even existed at all.</p><p>“Real ghosts?” Ben jumped up in anticipation. “Dean, you can teach me how to kill ‘em!”</p><p>Ingrid looked at Dean questioningly.</p><p>“He means I can... um... kill ‘em with teaching him the rich history of your beautiful inn,” Dean said through clenched teeth. He shot a look at Ben. “Adjoining rooms sound great, the spookier the better,” he added with a forced grin.</p><p>“Lovely. Here are your keys.” Ingrid handed Lisa a set of keys with a clipper ship key ring hanging off them. “Go up the stairs and to your right. Your rooms are the third and fourth doors on the left, overlooking the historic Salem Common.”</p><p>“Thank you so much,” Lisa said. They picked up their bags and trudged up the wide wooden staircase to the inn’s second-floor rooms. Lisa opened the highly polished wooden door with brass numbers on it. She smiled gamely at Dean and walked into the room ahead of him.</p><p>“I think this is pretty. Don’t you?” she asked, throwing open the blue-and-yellow-flowered curtains.</p><p>Dean surveyed the large garish floral bedspread and the ruffled pillow shams. This in fact wasn’t his idea of comfortable, he felt like he was back in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in the Carrigan’s house. They had been pagan gods of the Winter Solstice, and their design aesthetic was similar to the room: like someone just vomited up a quilting bee.</p><p>Dean smiled. If this was what made Lisa happy that he would cope. Besides, he wasn’t here to relax, he wanted to get started searching for a witch as soon as possible. But Lisa had other plans.</p><p>“I’m starving, let’s go get some fried clams and French fries,” she said with a smile. “It’s a gorgeous day. I don’t want to spend a minute inside.”</p><p>What was Dean going to say? As much as he wanted to start his mission, he knew that he had to spend at least a little time with Lisa and Ben.</p><p>“Okay then,” he said.</p><p>Outside the sun was shining. As they made their way through the narrow streets, tourists crammed the brick sidewalks. Dean wondered at all the people enjoying their lives—oblivious to how much Sam and Dean had sacrificed so that they could continue on as normal. Would they even appreciate it if they knew? Dean doubted it. He didn’t get a chance to walk among the masses very often and he was pretty sure he hadn’t missed much as he watched tourists munching ice cream cones and shoving their bratty kids in front of buildings and statues to be photographed. For a moment he wondered why he even cared about saving all these schlubs’ lives. It made him itch to get Sam back all the more.</p><p>“How about here?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m starved,” Ben added.</p><p>They tramped into a fish and chip shop called “Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky.” A wooden sign hung above the doorway: a drunken-looking cartoon sailor and a clam clung to one another in what looked like mid-song.</p><p>At the back of the restaurant a creaky covered porch hung out over the water. The bay was blue and still. They placed their order and then sat down at a brown-paper-covered picnic table. To their right, a couple of old clipper ships bobbed next to an ancient blackened pier.</p><p>“Are those pirate ships?” Ben asked, looking out over the water. “I totally want to go on a pirate ship.”</p><p>Dean smiled smugly at Lisa as if to say, “I told you so.”</p><p>“Sure are. You and your mom can take a tour of them this afternoon if you want,” Dean said.</p><p>“What about you?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I thought I’d... you know, look around town and find fun things to do. Plan the rest of our trip,” Dean said casually.</p><p>Minutes later, toasty piles of fish, clams, and chips heaped in paper baskets were placed in front of them by a young girl who looked to be a little older than Ben.</p><p>“My name’s Perry. Just let me know if you need anything else,” she said with a smile directed at Ben. Ben blushed.</p><p>“Thanks,” Lisa said with an edge.</p><p>Perry bobbed a little curtsey and returned to her place behind the ordering counter, Ben’s eyes followed her.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Lisa said gently as she squeezed ketchup onto a plate and dragged a fry though it. “She’s five years older than you.”</p><p>“She’s not five years older. She’s like fifteen,” Ben said.</p><p>“How do you know?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m twelve, Mom. I know,” Ben retorted. “Besides, she was just being nice. You’re always saying it takes a special person to make a lot of friends. Right?”</p><p>“Kid has a point. I’ve heard you say that,” Dean said, grinning at Lisa as he teased her.</p><p>“Whose side are you on?” Lisa asked, poking Dean light-heartedly in the ribs.</p><p>Dean dug into more of the food and enjoyed the moment. He liked looking out across the water. He and Sam had never spent much time on the coast.</p><p>Ben polished off his food in minutes.</p><p>“I’m still hungry,” he declared. “Can I have five bucks to get some more?”</p><p>“Oh, now you want more clams?” Dean smiled, reaching into his pocket and handing Ben a five. “I can see why. She’s cute.”</p><p>Ben blushed again.</p><p>“Naw, I just want some more fries. What’s the big deal?”</p><p>“Just act casual. Like you haven’t even noticed that she’s good-looking,” Dean confided.</p><p>“Really?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Absolutely. Pretty girls hate when people fawn over them. Just act natural. Like you couldn’t care less about her.”</p><p>Ben nodded earnestly and went up to the counter.</p><p>“Are you teaching my son to be a player?” Lisa asked half smiling, half serious.</p><p>“Kid has to know how to flirt. I’m just teaching him the basics. We haven’t even begun the master class.”</p><p>“Master class, huh?”</p><p>Ben came back with a large smile plastered across his face.</p><p>“We’re going to the movies,” he said proudly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear a question in there,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Can I go to the movies?” Ben rephrased, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“Wow, that girl sure moves fast,” Dean said, impressed.</p><p>Ben and Lisa went back and forth about whether it was a good idea for him to go to the movies in a strange town with a strange girl. Ben accused his mother of once again being overprotective.</p><p>Dean decided to sit this discussion out. Instead he watched the girl as she chatted affably with other customers. The teen kept stealing glances at him, like she was appraising something. She gave off a much more sophisticated air than a regular teenager. In that respect Lisa was right, Dean thought. But he figured Perry was a savvy, towny chick who regularly asked boys out in order to get a free movie and some popcorn. No harm in that.</p><p>They left Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky and wandered around the square before following the throngs of people down one of the touristy little street, crammed with gift shops and cafés.</p><p>“Witch museum? We gotta go there.” Ben pointed out a tall, large, stone-faced building towering above them, with a stream of people queuing out the door and around the corner.</p><p>“Looks popular. Yeah, you guys should definitely do that,” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean, I thought we were here to spend time <span class="italic">together</span>?” Lisa said quietly, out of earshot of Ben. “We didn’t come all this way so you could wander off alone.”</p><p>Dean knew she was right, and he didn’t want to upset her. But he had come to Salem to raise Sam, and he had to find a way to do that without Lisa finding out his real motive.</p><p>“Lis, I’m just saying,” Dean said gently, “I might want to go off and do a little exploring myself. Like boring stuff. You know I’m a big history buff. They have some great historical reference libraries in town. I might want to hit those.”</p><p>“You’re a big history buff?” Lisa looked at him skeptically.</p><p>“Yeah, totally. Ask me anything about the Bible—I bet I know it,” Dean countered.</p><p>“I’m not going to a library on my vacation,” Ben chimed in.</p><p>“See, what did I tell you. Kid doesn’t want to go to a library,” Dean said. “Don’t worry about it, we’re totally Brady Bunch Does Honolulu this week, except of course minus like seven people.”</p><p>“Six. Minus six people,” Lisa corrected him with a grin.</p><p>“Who’re you counting? Alice’s boyfriend didn’t go to Hawaii with them,” Dean said.</p><p>They continued to argue the specifics of the Brady Bunch Hawaii trip as they passed a quaint shop with bay windows filled to the brim with witchy tchotchkes and a whole bunch of other stuff that all looked to Dean like worthless crap.</p><p>“Let’s go in here,” Ben said, veering in through the front door.</p><p>Lisa and Dean followed him into the store.</p><p>As far as Dean could see in the gloom, they were the only customers. Other tourists must have been put off by the slightly odiferous shop with its cloister-like atmosphere and creaky floorboards.</p><p>Across the back wall of the store, large apothecary jars full of herbs lined the shelves. Dean noted the handwritten tags identifying the contents—many of them could be used in black magic: calamus root, mustard seed, valerian root, black pepper, licorice root chips. But a lot of them were harmless potpourri fillers too: lavender, lemongrass, sandalwood. Dean wondered if this store catered for the local witches.</p><p>The store also had a lot of other junk found everywhere in New England, including the all-pervasive Yankee candles, cheap Chinese-made cut-glass candy dishes, and black soap shaped like cats and witches’ hats.</p><p>“Hiya!”</p><p>A young girl of about twenty appeared through a door covered with a bead curtain. The strings of glass moved and clinked together as the Perky Polly jumped behind the counter.</p><p>“Welcome to ‘Connie’s Curios and Conversations,’ what can I do you for?” The girl was dressed in a long hippy-like skirt, with a couple of scarves wrapped around her waist. She wore a little charm on a black-leather bracelet around her wrist.</p><p>“Whoa Mom, can I get this?” Ben said, holding up an alligator foot.</p><p>“What on earth for?” Lisa responded.</p><p>“Hoodoo spell, brings luck, sometimes love. Wouldn’t be the dumbest thing to carry on your date tomorrow,” Dean said to Ben.</p><p>“You’re not helping!” Lisa glared at Dean. “It’s not a date, is it, Ben?”</p><p>Dean winked at Ben over Lisa’s head. Ben shook his head.</p><p>“Nope, Ma. It’s not a date. I promise,” he said with a smirk.</p><p>“Let me know if you need anything!” the girl called again. “You know your witchcraft,” she added, eyeing Dean.</p><p>“Yeah, you know. I just dabble,” he said as he looked around the store. “You’re well stocked. Got any puppy heads?”</p><p>“Dean!” Lisa swung round and looked at him.</p><p>The girl behind the counter suddenly lost her perk. Her face tightened.</p><p>“No we don’t,” she said brusquely.</p><p>“Oh okay, just wondering,” Dean said. He fingered the gris-gris bag in his pocket. If this girl was a witch or tried to mess with him, he was protected. Puppy skulls, ground puppy skulls, were used in some of the darkest spells, specifically in hoodoo, to bind demons. And by making the material into a ball, covering it in sulfur, and burying it where a person would walk over it—some believed that it could kill.</p><p>The girl held up a jade necklace with charms hanging from it.</p><p>“You know what? This would look gorgeous on you,” she said to Lisa.</p><p>Lisa appraised it. “It’s pretty, I don’t know if it’s my style though,” she said.</p><p>“You want to try it on?” the girl asked.</p><p>Dean stepped closer to the counter and leaned over toward the girl.</p><p>“It’s not really her thing,” he said. “Let’s go guys.”</p><p>Dean walked out of the store, Lisa and Ben following behind.</p><p>“What did you do that for?” Lisa asked, falling into step with Dean.</p><p>“That necklace had a black cat’s bone on it,” he said.</p><p>“Really?” Ben said. “Cool.”</p><p>“It did? What would that do?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“It would have helped her trace where you were. Sort of like a witch GPS. I should go in there and bust that shop up,” Dean growled.</p><p>“Dean, really, I think you’re mistaken. I’m sure she was just a hippy girl trying to do her job,” Lisa insisted.</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean said.</p><p>Whether the girl was a witch or not, there was something about her that Dean didn’t trust. Despite all the fru-fru stuff in the store, a real witch could stock up on some powerful stuff in there if they knew what they were doing.</p><p>Lisa, Ben, and Dean wound their way back to the inn. Dean hesitated when they got to the door.</p><p>“Hey, I’m going to continue to look around,” Dean said.</p><p>“Really?” Lisa asked</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll be back soon. Rest up.” Dean waved away her concern. “I just want to check the place out.”</p><p>“Okay, see you later,” Lisa said, and she and Ben disappeared into the inn.</p><p>Dean quickly walked across the street and popped the trunk to the CRV. His close parking job made it difficult to get it open. Dean struggled, trying not to hit the hood of the car behind it. The Impala wouldn’t have this problem.</p><p>He wanted to go back to the store and see what he could get out of the hippy chick, but something caught his attention. He looked up at the inn across the street and saw Ben in the window of their room. His eyes were as wide as saucers and he was beating on the window trying to get Dean’s attention.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle, which was stuffed into the wheel well of the spare tire, slammed the door shut, then ran back across the street.</p><p>SCREEECH!</p><p>A car ground to a halt, its grill a mere three inches away from Dean’s kneecaps.</p><p>Dean looked up again. Ben had disappeared from the window. He ran inside, startling Ingrid.</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Winchester, do you—“ she called.</p><p>“No time, Bea Arthur,” Dean yelled over his shoulder as he took the stairs three at a time. He reached the landing and spun around, almost knocking Ben over.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dean asked, grabbing Ben’s arm and heading toward the door of their room.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t—“ the boy stammered, he looked scared.</p><p>Inside, Lisa was curled on the bed, sweat dripping off her forehead. Her eyes were glassy and rolling up into their lids.</p><p>“Lis, Lis? can you hear me? Did you drink anything?” Dean shook her and frantically looked around the room. He picked up an open water bottle and smelled it. Nothing.</p><p>Lisa was shaking all over and her hands had palsied and curled up under her chin.</p><p>“What’s wrong with her?” Ben asked, his eyes watering with fear.</p><p>“Ben, I need you to search around the room. See if you find anything like this,” Dean said, taking the gris-gris bag out of his pocket. “Can you do that for me?”</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah,” Ben said.</p><p>“Look underneath everything, inside everything,” Dean directed. “Lisa, stay with me. What did you touch? Did you eat anything?”</p><p>Her body shook. Blood trickled from her mouth. She started coughing.</p><p>“Dean, what’s happening?” she sputtered.</p><p>“Just stay with me,” Dean said urgently.</p><p>“Dean?” Lisa choked. She reached into her mouth and tugged at something, a creature emerged from between her lips, wriggling in her grip. Staring at it in horror, she screamed and fainted. The lizard scampered away to the corner of the room.</p><p>“Mom!” Ben yelled.</p><p>“Okay, just stay calm. We have to find the bag,” Dean instructed.</p><p>He took out his knife and sliced straight through the butter-colored wing-back chair in the corner. He flipped it over and dug through the springs with the blade. Nothing. He pulled all the covers off the other queen-sized bed, flipped the mattress, tore through the box spring. Nothing.</p><p>In the bathroom Dean poured out every lotion, tossed every towel onto the floor. Nothing.</p><p>He stomped back to the bedroom window and pulled down the curtains, kicking through the pleats.</p><p>Still unconscious, Lisa fell from the bed and was now writhing on the floor, but no more lizards appeared from her throat.</p><p>Then Dean saw it, a little bag sitting on the table underneath an aging, dried bouquet of magnolias. He picked it up and opened it. Inside was some dragon’s blood, a black cat’s bone, thyme, and, Dean guessed, a couple of different kinds of oil.</p><p>“What is it?” Ben asked.</p><p>“It’s a hex bag and it’s making your mom sick,” Dean said as he took out his Zippo and lit it. The felt bag went up in flames and Dean dropped it into the trash can to smolder.</p><p>They gently lifted Lisa back onto the bed, and after a few moments she opened her eyes and rubbed her throat.</p><p>“What happened?” she asked.</p><p>“We had company. How do you feel?” Dean helped her sit up on the bed, gently brushing her hair away from her clammy forehead.</p><p>“I’m okay, I think. Who did this? What’s going on?” Lisa gestured to the destroyed room.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Ben and I had to find what was making you sick, but it’s all right now. Or it will be—I’ll fix it. I got to go out for a short while. Will you be okay here?” Dean didn’t want to scare her, but he had to go and find whoever had done this. Maybe that little witch in the strange store could give him some answers.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Lisa looked at him, eyes wide and fearful.</p><p>“I won’t be long,” Dean said, leaning down and kissing her hot cheek. He then pulled his duffle onto his shoulder and looked at Ben. “Take care of your mom and stay here—okay?”</p><p>Ben nodded his head solemnly.</p><p>With a lowered voice Dean said, “Let’s not tell your mom about what just happened if she doesn’t remember. Okay?”</p><p>Ben nodded again, glancing at his mom with worried eyes. Dean reasoned he didn’t need to tip Lisa off that there was something rotten in Salem—there was no reason to make her afraid and he could fix this.</p><p>Dean closed the door behind him, then turned and came face to face with a red-faced Ingrid.</p><p>“Sorry about the noise. Charades. So much fun. I’ll pay for the damages,” Dean said, brushing past them and heading down the stairs.</p><p>Dean kicked open the inn door and headed outside. He felt the outline of his gun in his duffle bag. He wasn’t quite sure where he was going to go, but he knew one thing: There were witches in Salem.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twelve">CHAPTER TWELVE</span><a href="#chapter-twelve" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Pull over here,” Samuel instructed.</p><p>Sam had pulled off Route 95 and into the area around Salem known as Danvers. He then pulled the van into a motel with a colonial theme. They unloaded their gear and Samuel checked them in under aliases.</p><p>Being in Salem at the same time as Dean posed a couple of problems. Sam would have to stay pretty much hidden, which would be difficult. His six-foot-four frame stood out anywhere. It might also cause some awkwardness if Dean caught sight of his long-dead grandfather.</p><p>To Sam it wasn’t quite clear why they were here, but he had learned over the past couple of months to do what he was told. If Samuel had a reason to be here, so did he. If there were witches in Salem, Sam had plenty of experience with them and he knew that they were bad news.</p><p>Samuel and Sam walked side by side, lugging their gear towards their respective rooms.</p><p>“We can get a bead on Dean tomorrow,” Samuel proposed. “Shouldn’t be too hard, kid has the manners of a drunken ox.”</p><p>“Actually, I think I’m going to go look around now,” Sam said.</p><p>Samuel shrugged. “Fine. Just try to keep your big mug out of sight.”</p><p>Sam nodded. After throwing his gear into his room, he made his way back to the van.</p><p>First he drove through the parking lots of every motel in the surrounding area, but he didn’t spot Dean’s car. Next, he decided to swing by the more touristy part of town. No sign of Dean. Then, as he turned a corner onto a smaller side street, he glanced into the narrow alley behind the buildings, and caught a glimpse of his brother as he ducked into a recess at the back of an old clapboard building.</p><p>Sam swung around front and parked his van on the street in front of a shop. He hopped out and peered in through the shop windows and clocked all the herbs in jars. He figured that Dean had come to the same conclusion he had—this place screamed witchcraft.</p><p>Daylight broke through the back of the store. It looked as though someone had just kicked in the back door. Wary of breaking Samuel’s rules and encountering his brother, Sam decided to wait inside the van.</p><p>The store was closed from what Dean could see. The town seemed to be quickly closing down in the evening light. Around back he examined the door to the shop.</p><p>“No Ye Olde Alarm System?” he muttered to himself.</p><p>Dean’s foot went clear through the rotting, wooden back door. His foot hit right near the lock, tearing it off its hinges so it hung lopsided, like a tongue hanging out of a dog’s mouth.</p><p>Gun at the ready, Dean snuck into the back room of the store. Through the dim light he could see boxes and boxes of witch-themed items stacked on top of one another.</p><p>“Connie’s Curios and Crap,” Dean murmured.</p><p>He moved through to the main store. He figured that in his short time in Salem he had pissed someone off and while he, Lisa, and Ben were out, that someone had snuck into the hotel room and planted the bag. The hex put on Lisa had been strong. It took someone with a pretty potent knowledge of the black arts to put together a hex bag like that.</p><p>Dean moved through the shop, eyes peeled for anything suspicious. He poked around the counter near the register. Nothing of interest. To his right he noticed a steep staircase leading to the second floor.</p><p>Dean peeked through the narrow opening, up the twisting staircase. <span class="italic">Hobbit sized,</span> he thought. <span class="italic">Ugh.</span> Dean twisted around and pulled himself up the stairs, leading with his sawed-off. At the top was a pokey little hallway.</p><p>Floorboards creaked under Dean’s weight. He winced.</p><p>WHAACK!</p><p>Dean felt the burning sensation radiate through the back of his head and down his spine as he fell forward onto his stomach. The sawed-off skittered across the wide-planked floor and came to rest under a heating unit. Above him, the hippy girl stood, a baseball bat emblazoned with a Red Sox emblem in her hands.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Janice Joplin, take it easy,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his head. He inspected a smudge of blood on his fingers.</p><p>“What’re you doing here? Didn’t you see the ‘Closed’ sign on the door? Or do you New York folks always just do what you want and walk in like you own the place?” she demanded.</p><p>“Whoa, hold it. First off, I’m not from New York. Secondly, I was in here an hour ago with my girlfriend—“</p><p>“That was your girlfriend? You look like her dad.”</p><p>“What?” Dean put his hands up in a placatory gesture. “Okay, you can ‘What to Wear’ me a makeover later. The door downstairs was open.”</p><p>“Open like falling open or unlocked? Because I’m pretty sure the hinges didn’t shatter by themselves.”</p><p>Dean shrugged, then pulled himself onto his feet.</p><p>“Can I finish? I’m here, then I go back to my hotel. Next thing I know my girlfriend’s coughing up the GEICO gecko.”</p><p>“Lizards? Who’d you piss off?” she asked.</p><p>“That’s why I’m here. I came to find out.”</p><p>“Not me. I don’t do that revenge spell stuff.” The girl went to sit by the small slanted windows. “That’s more Connie’s bag than mine.”</p><p>“So you’re not Connie?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No. I’m Sukie. Nice to meet you,” she said dryly.</p><p>“Like Sukie Stackhouse?”</p><p>“God, no. Go back farther. Sukie Ridgemont, Michele Pfeiffer’s character in <span class="italic">Witches of Eastwick?</span> I was born the same year the movie came out. Thus the name.”</p><p>“So where’s Connie?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Connie’s a strange bird. I don’t see her much. I open and close the place most days. Occasionally I find a note from her telling me to wash the windows. That’s about it. Why do you want to talk to her?”</p><p>“You have some really strong ingredients downstairs, stuff that could be used in some pretty powerful spells. Plus, you tried to sell my girlfriend a necklace with a black cat’s bone on it.”</p><p>“I did? I didn’t know that.”</p><p>“You didn’t know there was a black cat’s bone on something you sell?”</p><p>“No. I mean— Listen, I mostly do love spells, money spells, whatever. Just some herbs, a candle and a little chanting. I stay away from any hardcore stuff. Plus, Connie is the one that stocks all the shelves. Actually, she called this morning and told me to push the necklaces on anyone that came in. So I did. I really didn’t know there was a cat’s bone on it. She’s the one with... umm... She dabbles in the darker stuff, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>“Dabbles in witchcraft? How do you ‘dabble’ in witchcraft?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Okay, fine. She’s like really, really into it. I try not to get in her way. Connie’s like old school, been in town forever, way before the Skechers store and the yogurt shops started opening up.”</p><p>“So, you’re a good witch?” Dean raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Just call me Glinda,” Sukie said.</p><p>“Right, I get it. So where can I find this Connie? If she’s pretty hooked in, I’d like to talk to her.”</p><p>“Umm. I guess I can tell you where she lives.” Sukie shrugged. “Her old family place, last name of Hennrick. Go north out of town, you can’t miss it. What did you say your name was?”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Dean said.</p><p>“Weird, ‘cause you look sorta familiar. You have family in town?”</p><p>“What’s with the <span class="italic">Who Do You Think You Are?</span> genealogy questions?” Dean said, a little miffed.</p><p>“Wow, way to go for the Friday night TV. Were you under house arrest? No one watches that.”</p><p>“Okay, Glinda, I’m out of here. And since you beaned me with a bat, I expect you’re going to forget that your back door had an accident.”</p><p>“Like I said, I have a wealth spell. I’m not worried,” Sukie said.</p><p>Dean wanted to find Lisa’s attacker, but was beginning to get the distinct feeling that there was more to Salem than he had first thought. He left by the broken back door.</p><p>At the front of the store, Sam got out of his truck and peeked through the window. He spotted a shopgirl and banged on the glass.</p><p>She looked up and mouthed, “We’re closed.”</p><p>“I just have a quick question,” Sam yelled, indicating he needed her to open the door.</p><p>“Dude, come back tomorrow.” She shook her head and went to the back of the store.</p><p>Sam cautiously doubled back to the alley where he had seen Dean. The coast was clear. Sam walked up the alley and peeked his head through the doorway. The girl stood there surveying the damage to the door.</p><p>“I just have a couple questions,” Sam said.</p><p>“Listen Bigfoot, I’m already late, so if you don’t mind, I’m just going to close this here door on your face and you can come back tomorrow to get your glow-in-the-dark witch mask.”</p><p>“Okay Sabrina, cut the crap,” Sam said, his patience at an end. “I’m going to ask you some questions and you’re gonna flap those sweet hippy lips of yours. Get it?”</p><p>“Oh wow, the sensitivity training is doing wonders. You throw any puppies into rivers lately? Tell me, how do you feel?” The girl had lost her fresh-faced gaze, and she now looked decidedly mean. “Because I’ve seen corpses before, but never one walking and talking like you. Though you don’t so much walk as lumber.”</p><p>“What the hell are you on about?” Sam demanded. He hadn’t met many people who could tell straight off that he was... unusual.</p><p>“Puh-lease, you can see your silly walk from a mile away.”</p><p>“I meant about me,” Sam growled.</p><p>“I’m a witch, lug-head. I got powers. I can feel things. You’re off. Can’t you feel that?”</p><p>Sam wasn’t in an introspective mood.</p><p>“What’d you say to him?” He inclined his head down the alley, in the direction Dean had presumably headed.</p><p>The girl smirked. “Who? The guy that just left? He your shower-buddy or something? You guys look similar—same Cro-Magnon brow.”</p><p>“He’s my... Forget it. What did he want?” Sam demanded.</p><p>“His girlfriend got sick. He thought someone like me or my boss might have hexed her. We carry a lot of shit here. I told him I didn’t do anything. He and the chick seemed harmless. I might have mentioned that my boss was into heavier shit. But that’s it. I sent him on his way. I don’t need people up in my grill. I played it nice and sweet with him. You, I don’t like too much.”</p><p>“Well, glad I’m getting to see the real you. What about the other witch-bitches around here, know anything about what they’re doing?”</p><p>“I don’t hang with anyone else if that’s what you mean. I live with my mom, who makes soap for a living. I work, I text my boyfriend, and occasionally I rearrange my Netflix queue. Like I told the other guy, not everyone with a gift hangs around together here. I know it’s Salem, but we don’t all put on witchy hats and ride around on brooms.”</p><p>“And that guy just went away, you didn’t tell him anything else?” Sam was skeptical this chick was telling the truth.</p><p>“Yawn. Yes, and no. Can I go now?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sam spun around on his heel and walked back down the alley.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” the girl shouted after him. “Dick.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirteen">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-thirteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A cool evening fog rolled in from the ocean. Dean walked back toward the inn. He took a shortcut through an old graveyard. Under normal circumstances Dean would end up digging and burning things when he was in a bone yard, but he found himself looking at the worn stone faces of various headstones. Lichen stuck to the weathered stones, making some of the names difficult to read. Nevertheless Dean found himself enthralled. These people had all been accused of witchcraft.</p><p>Dean knew a little about the history of the Salem witch trials. He supposed that maybe the people lying underfoot could actually have been witches, in that case, good riddance to them. But he also knew that envy and suspicion could cause a lot more harm than a couple of people doing spells so their crops didn’t die.</p><p>Dean reached the inn, crossed the street and threw his duffle in the trunk of the car. He supposed that he should probably go up and see how Lisa and Ben were doing, he peered up at their bedroom window, the curtains were tightly drawn. But he really wanted to find this Connie woman. If she practiced the dark arts like her employee said, then she might be behind the attack on Lisa. She also might be powerful enough to be able to help him raise Sam. Either way, Dean needed to find out more information before he confronted Connie Hennrick.</p><p>Closing the trunk, Dean headed into the lobby of the inn. Ingrid smiled saltily from behind the counter. She waved Dean over. In front of her was an itemized bill of the damage to their room.</p><p>“I’m having the curtains and floor professionally cleaned. The fire you started in the waste basket smelled everything up. I’ve also moved you all to a different room.”</p><p>Dean nodded and thanked her. He really didn’t care. But now more than ever he wished they were staying in one of his usual crap-hole motels. He put on his sweetest smile.</p><p>“Ingrid, if I wanted to find out information about a family who’s been in Salem for a while, where would I go? Is there a library in town or something?” Even in the age of the Internet, some information could only be culled from old-fashioned records.</p><p>“There’s the Peabody Essex Museum. Not walking distance though. Lots of tourists go there to see if they were related to anyone in the Salem witch trials. My great, great, great, great grandmother lived in Boston and her husband came up to see the Court of Oyer and Terminer.”</p><p>“The court of what?” Dean asked.</p><p>“It’s the court that heard the testimony of all the girls accusing people of being witches. In any case, Peabody Museum. Look up your ancestor names. Though I never heard of Winchesters in Salem.”</p><p>“Probably not. Thanks for the info,” Dean said.</p><p>Dean made his way back out of the door again. After changing into a tweed jacket and khakis—his professor outfit—Dean followed his GPS to the museum.</p><p>An old woman in a beige pantsuit was just locking the door from the inside as Dean walked up. He rapped on the glass panel of the door and mustered his most academic-looking smile, pressing a Harvard ID up against the glass.</p><p>The old woman unlocked the door.</p><p>“Sorry, we’re closed. Come back tomorrow,” she said and went to close the door again.</p><p>Dean stuck his foot against it to stop her. He smiled winningly.</p><p>“Pardon my tardiness,” he began, and cleared his throat. “I’m Doctor Jones from Harvard. I have a lecture tomorrow and I’m terribly behind on a crucial part of my research. Is there any way...?” Dean gestured with his hand.</p><p>The old woman looked him over. Dean beamed at her, turning up the charm another notch and keeping his foot in place against the door.</p><p>It must have worked as she smiled brightly back at him, nodded, opened the door and ushered Dean into a wood-paneled room.</p><p>“Now what family are you looking for, Doctor Jones?” she asked Dean, moving behind the counter.</p><p>“I’m actually looking for information on the Hennricks,” Dean said.</p><p>“Humm, I’m not sure if we have much on that family. Let me see,” she said, taking a list from a draw in the table.</p><p>Dean peered at it from upside down, it seemed to be a list of families starting from when Salem was first settled in 1628.</p><p>“Hmm. Abbey, Adams, Allen, Baily, Bayley, Bibber, Churchill, Campbell, Cory—“</p><p>“Wait,” Dean said, taking the paper and flipping it so he could read it the right way round. “Campbell?”</p><p>“Yes, right here.” She jabbed the paper. “Not much there though, if I remember correctly. I can get the box for you, if you want.”</p><p>“Yes please,” Dean said.</p><p>The old woman disappeared for a few minutes and then shuffled back holding a dusty box.</p><p>“This is all we have on the Campbells. Let me know if you need anything else,” she said. “I have a few things to finish up so I can give you about half an hour.”</p><p>Dean nodded and thanked her. She left him to it and he sat down at one of the dark-wood tables near by and opened up the box.</p><p>Inside was an old leather journal, imprinted in faded gold script “Nathaniel Campbell.” Dean carefully opened the cottony, yellowed pages.</p><p>He had never heard of any Campbell relatives in Salem, Massachusetts. Though he didn’t know about many relatives past his grandparents, Samuel and Deanna. But whoever this Nathaniel Campbell was, it seemed he was an avid journal writer.</p><p>Dean peered at the first page, it was dated 1664. A flowing brown script spread across the page. He began to read:</p><blockquote><p>I signed the homestead papers today with the honorable Cotton Mather. The price is three English pounds each year hence. The property starts around twenty meters from the old oak tree at the corner of the road to Ipswich. It runs around 500 meters wide and some 2,000 meters deep. On the west side it is bordered by a small brook, and on the south by the river that runs to Ipswich.</p></blockquote><p>Dean stopped reading and flipped through a couple more pages. On a page dated “Feb. 1692” something caught his eye:</p><blockquote><p>A young girl’s body was found north of the village today. Abigail Faulkner age 14 was found in the snow with her throat cut. I asked the village doctor, William Grigg, if I could see the body to give the poor girl her Last Rites. I got there before Reverend Parris—otherwise he surely would have raised a big fuss and then I would not have been able to examine her. The Widow Faulkner did not want to delay one minute, lest her daughter not rise up to Heaven. She gave me permission to administer them. I insisted on having a moment or two alone with the body first in order to “make it right and proper” for the widow to see her daughter. In that short amount of time I came to a couple of clear conclusions that I am sure the good physician will not. Namely, the girl’s neck was broken, even though it was sliced, the neck bones were pulverized, as if by a regular wood-chopping axe. But there was no bruising in the back of her neck. I fear the force might have come from something otherworldly. I am quite sure I exterminated the witches some years back, but perhaps more have fallen under the dark spell of Satan. I can only hope not.</p><p>But I fear that my sons may be correct: Witches are again in Salem.</p></blockquote><p>Dean sat back and stared at the page. Could this be the journal of his ancestor? Could Nathaniel Campbell be a great, great, great grandfather on his mother’s side? Dean shuddered. He had to read the rest of the journal.</p><p>Rising from his seat he peered out into the dark corridor beyond the wood-paneled room. The click, click, click of the docent’s heels pierced the silence. Dean always carried his father’s journal in his jacket pocket. With Sam gone, Dean really had nothing else to connect him to his family. He removed the leather cover of Nathaniel’s journal with his pocket knife, then carefully wrapped it around John Winchester’s. They were of a similar weight and size and surely no one else would be coming to look at an old Campbell family journal. When Dean was finished he would return and switch them back.</p><p>“Did you find what you were looking for?” the old woman asked as Dean passed her on his way out.</p><p>“And more,” Dean said.</p><p>Dean drove back to the bed and breakfast and was relieved to find Lisa and Ben watching TV and eating burgers they had ordered from the inn’s kitchen—one waited for him as well.</p><p>Lisa said she was feeling better, but she still looked pale. She said she was going to rally in the morning so they could go see the clipper ships. Ben proceeded to speak in a pirate accent for the rest of the night.</p><p>Dean munched his burger and then sat back on the other bed and took out the pages of Nathaniel Campbell’s journal.</p><p>“What’s that?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Just something I picked up from the library,” Dean replied.</p><p>He started to read about a family of hunters named Campbell.</p><h2><span id="chapter-fourteen">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-fourteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Caleb Campbell and his older brother by three years, Thomas, were walking back from the village when they saw a man and his cart emerge from a little-used road that ran to the northwest. He was wild-eyed and perspiring as he approached the boys.</p><p>“The Devil has been let out, boys. Get thee home and lock the door,” the man yelled.</p><p>“Why sir?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“‘Tis the Devil himself killed a poor little thing. Too gruesome for children like you to see.”</p><p>The man indicated a wrapped bundle in the back of his simple horse cart. Two snow-covered shoes peeped out from beneath the burlap covering. It was a dead body, and from the size of the feet, and style of shoe, it was that of a young girl.</p><p>The man hastened his horses toward Salem Village.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb looked at one another.</p><p>“It’s about time,” Caleb said. “This village was putting me to sleep.”</p><p>Even in the wintry light, Caleb’s sandy-blond hair shone like a summer sun. He had dark eyes and a wide-set mouth. Though he was the younger of the two Campbell brothers, he was by far the better student.</p><p>Thomas was already acquiring his adolescent brawn. The breadth of his shoulders had outgrown his coat. His mother had tanned a couple of hides from the previous winter’s hunt and sewn him a jacket. It was all deer hide, burnished to a walnut brown. She had pulled the collar up to cover most of Thomas’s neck and sewn two large pockets for his mittens, which he would surely lose several times that winter. Thomas’s coat didn’t look like any of the other boys’ clothes in town. But that was the way all the Campbells were—they didn’t quite fit in.</p><p>The Campbell family had come from Europe with the wave of English-speaking settlers in the mid-1600s. No one knew exactly which country they had originated from. They traded a few of their crops in the village, but for the most part they kept to themselves. They did not attend church, which sparked the ire of many townspeople, in particular the new minister, Reverend Parris.</p><p>Nathaniel Campbell wasn’t a religious man anyway, but he didn’t trust Reverend Parris. He told his children never to trust a man so desperate for adoration and attention. “A man such as that can be dangerous,” Nathaniel warned his family. It was for that reason Nathaniel told the clergyman that they would worship at home on Sundays and Thursdays, the days when people gathered in the tavern to talk about the Bible. Though in fact, rather than worshipping, Nathaniel made his three children study.</p><p>The Campbell children weren’t learning the Bible—they already knew it back to front—instead they were studying Latin, herbs, and texts about monsters that their ancestors had written. The family business was hunting and it was very important to Nathaniel that his two sons and daughter continue the Campbell tradition.</p><p>Thomas looked at his brother.</p><p>“You go tell Father and I’ll follow that man to town,” he said.</p><p>“Why do you get to follow him? I want to follow him,” Caleb objected.</p><p>“Because I’m older, and if I’m caught I’m better spoken,” Thomas responded.</p><p>Caleb shook his head but started toward the family farm anyway, while his brother ran after the man and his cart.</p><p>Thomas was fast and caught up with the man’s tired mare before it had reached Salem. In the village the visitor stopped and asked a local resident where to find the nearest doctor. He was directed toward the east end of town, and Thomas followed cautiously from a distance.</p><p>When they reached the doctor’s, he waited a short way down the street, crouched down next to another cart, while the man stepped inside.</p><p>A couple of minutes later the portly physician emerged from the house and approached the cart. He scooped up the body of the young girl and hurried back inside.</p><p>Thomas ran to the window of the doctor’s house and peered through the tiny glass pane. The men were laying the young girl’s body on a table.</p><p>Thomas grew anxious. He knew that his father would want to find out what had killed the girl, and he could only do that by examining the body.</p><p>The ways Nathaniel could gain access to the bodies were many, but normally he would lie and dissemble. If they were in another town or county Nathaniel would dress up as a man of the church, or sometimes pose as a merchant or a judge. Nathaniel always kept a couple of changes of clothes in his sack for these exact occasions. He would insist that he needed to see the body before anyone else did. Once he had gained access, he was usually quick to identify the culprit.</p><p>Thomas knew that his father was used to seeing strange animal bites or scratches. He knew what kind of mark a wendigo made—his Indian friends had helped him identify the first one he had ever come across. But such things would have induced panic in the common colonist. Even though the Bible played the primary cultural role in Puritan communities, Christianity couldn’t quash the inherent folk beliefs that people had brought over from Europe.</p><p>Many of the colonists were superstitious: the English spoke of baby-stealing fairies, the French of <span class="italic">loup-garou,</span> and German merchants of <span class="italic">Vampir.</span> So Nathaniel often hid evidence of those creatures, for the safety of the colony. Sometimes he would patch the wounds up on the victim’s corpse before anyone else could see them—he carried a candle for just that purpose, to drip wax into the wounds to hide them.</p><p>Before Thomas could come up with a plan to gain access alone, his father and Caleb arrived at the doctor’s in their rickety carriage. Thomas could make out the outline of the worn book of Latin spells inside his father’s coat. He always carried it with him just in case the victim was demonically possessed.</p><p>Nathaniel jumped out of the carriage as Caleb tied the horse to a post. Nathaniel nodded to Thomas and entered the doctor’s house.</p><p>Caleb left the horse and crossed the street toward his brother. The boys listened quietly at the window. They understood immediately that the men had identified the girl: Abigail Faulkner. She lived with her mother and two lame twin brothers just north of town on a small plot of land only big enough for a couple of pigs and a vegetable garden. Thomas and Caleb knew her only by sight.</p><p>Inside the house, the men decided that they had to tell Abigail’s mother what had happened, and the doctor’s servant girl was sent to fetch Widow Faulkner.</p><p>The widow arrived some twenty minutes later, already upset. Abigail hadn’t returned home from a quilting circle she had attended at the Putnam household with a couple of other girls the previous evening. Her mother thought perhaps she had stayed the night with the girls and would return home today, but she had not.</p><p>Nathaniel gently explained to her what had happened and showed the widow her daughter’s body. Straight away she began to wail and weep. Nathaniel spoke to her in calm tones, telling her that he should administer the Last Rites immediately. Eventually she seemed to understand and nodded, allowing the doctor and the other man to help her into another room.</p><p>Nathaniel closed the door behind them then went to the window and opened it. His sons waited beneath.</p><p>“Hand me my bag. I haven’t much time,” Nathaniel directed.</p><p>They swiftly hoisted their father’s large leather bag in through the window, and Nathaniel got to work. First he examined the girl’s limbs looking for any strange bites or marks, besides the obvious cut through her throat. He found nothing. There was no smell of sulfur or scorching around the mouth, so no demons had been involved with her death.</p><p>Next Nathaniel took some herbs from his bag. He sprinkled them over the girl’s body, lit a candle and chanted some Latin phrases. Nothing happened. Nathaniel looked at her palms and feet—nothing suspicious there either.</p><p>Finally he checked the back of her neck, and gently probing with his fingertips he realized something very strange—her neck was completely limp.</p><p>Nathaniel went briefly into the other room to speak to the widow, and thank the doctor and the man. He then took his leave.</p><p>When their father emerged from the house, Caleb and Thomas jumped onto the cart. Nathaniel reigned the horses in silence, and the boys knew better than to speak to their father when he was deep in thought.</p><p>Once they were near the edge of the village, Nathaniel spoke.</p><p>“Her neck was completely broken,” he stated.</p><p>“Broken?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Like a chicken’s. But there wasn’t any bruising. Usually, such as with a hanging, there would be bruising,” Nathaniel mused darkly.</p><p>“How was it broken?” Thomas asked.</p><p>Nathaniel shook his head.</p><p>“There’s one obvious way to break a neck without touching someone.”</p><p>“Black magic?” Caleb hazarded.</p><p>“Exactly.” His father nodded.</p><p>“Didn’t her mother say that she was at a quilting circle at the Putnam household?” Thomas offered.</p><p>“Indeed,” Nathaniel said. “You boys go round to the Putnam house. Take some eggs. Say you want to trade with them. Find out when exactly Abigail Faulkner was there last. Also, look for any signs of witchery.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, right away,” Thomas said. He grabbed his brother, climbing off the cart and pulling Caleb after him. They grabbed a basket of fresh eggs off the back of the cart. In their line of business it was wise to always carry something to trade.</p><p>The boys waved goodbye to their father and trudged through deep snow back toward the village.</p><p>The Putnam house was just off Old Meetinghouse Road. When they reached the residence, they climbed the steps to the imposing front door and knocked determinedly. The echoing sound of their knocking was followed by a piercing scream from inside the building, then the heavy tromp of boots could be heard approaching the front door. There was another scream, and then a man with a long nose and a small birdlike bridge to his face opened the door.</p><p>It was Reverend Parris. His face was wracked with pain.</p><p>“What is it, boys?” Reverend Parris asked.</p><p>“We’ve come to trade some eggs and perhaps speak to Anne and Prudence? Is everything all right?” Thomas asked boldly, trying to peer around the figure of the clergyman to see what was happening inside.</p><p>Just then another scream came from inside the house and Anne Putnam, a small twelve-year-old girl, appeared behind Reverend Parris. She had a wild look in her eyes. She looked at Caleb, them being the same age, then grabbed his arm and tried to pull him into the house. Reverend Parris protested, grasping the girl’s wrist and freeing Caleb.</p><p>Mr. Putnam, Anne’s father, emerged into the hallway and the two men conferred briefly. Thomas and Caleb watched from the doorway.</p><p>“Come, come, you’ve come just in time,” Ann cried to Caleb. “See, see them there? Look how they scream at me. There, there! Up in the rafters!” She pointed toward the ceiling. The boys stepped cautiously into the hallway but when they looked up, they could see nothing unusal.</p><p>Another young girl, Prudence, who the boys knew to be Anne’s close friend, emerged from the shadows. She too seemed to be on the verge of hysteria. She cried out and fell on the ground, her body twisting into severe shapes and her tongue rolling out of her mouth.</p><p>As if suddenly noticing the boys’ presence, the Reverend pushed them back out of the front door.</p><p>“We have no time for you, boys,” he said. “Evil is upon us.” Just as he shut the door they heard Reverend Parris say to Mr. Putnam, “The same affliction has come to my house. My daughter and servant girl too scream out. It’s witches I tell you. Satan has come to Salem.”</p><p>As the boys went back down the steps, Thomas turned toward his younger brother.</p><p>“I think Anne Putnam has taken a shine to you.”</p><p>Caleb smirked at his brother’s sense of humor.</p><p>“Are you saying only a girl afflicted by an unseen force would like me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Thomas said matter-of-factly. “Let’s go tell Father that it seems these girls are troubled by witches.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-fifteen">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-fifteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Nathaniel Campbell and his family sat around the rough-hewn dinner table in front of the large hearth. The family was in deep discussion about the current events. Rose Mary Campbell filled everyone’s bowls with soup and a large crust of bread.</p><p>“I heard they’ve accused Parris’s servant, Tituba, as well as Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchery,” Hannah said. She was the eldest child, a well-mannered, quick-witted, fearless whip of a girl.</p><p>Though she was often left behind by Nathaniel and the boys on some of their more dangerous hunts, Hannah always made herself useful. She was fluent in four languages, including the local Indian dialect, which had helped her learn some of their religious practices. Her father relied on her to figure out many of the spells and books that they referenced.</p><p>“So we know that Abigail Faulkner and Reverend Parris’s daughter attend a quilting circle with Anne Putnam and Prudence Lewis,” Hannah continued.</p><p>“And all four of those girls are claiming to be afflicted by witches,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Poor Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. There will be a trial for those three I’m sure,” Rose Mary said. “Nothing gets Reverend Parris in more of a tizzy than the talk of evil. It is strange though, I’m sure they are just old women.”</p><p>“Are they witches, Father?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“I can’t be sure. I’ll try a marking spell on them, if I can get close to them at the trial. That should tell us for certain,” Nathaniel replied.</p><p>“I can’t imagine that those women are witches,” Hannah said. “Tituba seems like such a simple woman when I see her in the village.”</p><p>“Well then, who is afflicting the girls?” Caleb asked.</p><p>Hannah shrugged. “If I were a witch I wouldn’t be caught so easily. Don’t you think, Father?”</p><p>“The girls claim to be able to see the women afflicting them,” Nathaniel observed.</p><p>“Well, I can say a lot of things. I can say I see a horse with a lilac coat on in front of me. That doesn’t mean it’s true,” Hannah countered.</p><p>“I’ll try a marking spell on the three women. Then we’ll know for sure,” Nathaniel repeated.</p><p>“Do you think those women killed Abigail Faulkner?” Thomas asked.</p><p>Nathaniel thought about it for a moment.</p><p>“I think we can be sure that whomever killed Abigail is also afflicting the girls.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>A couple of days later, Reverend Parris’s servant Tituba, a slave he had brought with him to Salem from his time in the West Indies, was taken to the meetinghouse, along with the elderly Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne.</p><p>A great crowd gathered outside. Whispers of gossip swept through the people: four innocent girls were afflicted with horrible visions and manipulations by the women. <span class="italic">They must be witches,</span> the people murmured.</p><p>In the colonies, witchcraft was punishable by hanging, though in the past when accusations of witchcraft had erupted, no one had been hanged. But a particular fear struck everyone in the late winter of 1692.</p><p>All of New England was undergoing social and political upheaval and Salem had undergone a series of severe strains: The English and their impositions; as well as the raids by King Philip, the leader of the Wampanoag Indians, and his men, already had everyone on edge; and a smallpox epidemic had swept through much of New England.</p><p>On top of that, it had been a particularly cold winter and the people of Salem were desperate to escape their small smoky houses. Salem was infused with gossip and dispute, the people were restless and volatile and ready to believe the worst of their neighbors.</p><p>Nathaniel and his children pushed their way through the throng of people outside and managed to find standing places in the back of the meetinghouse. The interior of the building was carefully designed to instill fear into those being tried.</p><p>Along the far back wall two severe and imposing male figures, the judges, sat behind a long table. To the right of the table was a small platform with a banister, where the afflicted girls sat. The magistrates instructed the girls to face forward, toward them, but when the three accused women were brought in, the girls turned around and at the very sight of the women, started to writhe and scream. They pointed at the accused and cried that they had come to them as specters and asked them to sign the book of Satan. They claimed that when they refused, the women started to bewitch them.</p><p>Nathaniel, Hannah, Thomas, and Caleb carefully watched the young girls’ theatrics and observed the fear in the eyes of the accused women. The four girls seemed to be completely caught up in their own game. If one of the old women bent down, all the girls bent down and screamed that they were being forced to bend against their will. If one of them turned her head, all the girls screamed and turned their heads at unnatural angles.</p><p>To the crowd in the meetinghouse, watching with gasps of horror and mutterings about Satan, this was proof enough that the older women were witches. But the Campbell clan wanted further proof.</p><p>Nathaniel bent low and slipped two bags of herbs and oils into Hannah and Caleb’s hands.</p><p>“You’re going to have to get close to the women,” he murmured softly. “See if you can’t push your way to the front of the crowd. Place the bags under their chairs. I will then try to get close enough to do the rest.”</p><p>The children elbowed their way through the dense crowd. When they neared the front, Caleb burrowed his way forward until he was directly behind Tituba’s chair. He bent down as if to tie his shoelaces and quickly placed the bag in a corner of the chair spokes.</p><p>Being of slight build, Hannah managed to do the same for both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, with ease. She then slipped back through the crowd to her father’s side.</p><p>As a fully-grown man, Nathaniel found it more difficult to get through the crowd. But eventually he reached the accused women. Trying to not to draw attention to himself, he began his chant, whispering just loudly enough for the marking spell to take effect.</p><p>“Nathaniel Campbell,” a deep voice called out over the din of the crowd and screaming girls, “are you also possessed by witches?”</p><p>Nathaniel looked up and caught the eye of his questioner, John Hathorne, who was one of the judges, though he had no formal legal experience. The man’s air was stately and his voice boomed over the packed meetinghouse.</p><p>“No sir,” Nathaniel replied, his voice calm and clear. “I am praying for the girls that they will be freed from their bewitching.”</p><p>This answer seemed to satisfy Hathorne and he nodded and turned back to the inquest. Nathaniel finished the chant. He then crouched down behind the women’s chairs and peered at the palms of their hands. There were no marks.</p><p>Satisfied, Nathaniel retreated and signaled to his children to leave.</p><p>They returned home in their cart through the village, which was semi-deserted since most of the people of Salem were still thronging around the meetinghouse.</p><p>“Those magistrates are idiots,” Thomas declared. “Can’t they see that those women aren’t hurting the girls?”</p><p>“Then who is?” Caleb put in.</p><p>“Do you think they are putting on a show, Father?” Hannah asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure if they are faking or not,” Nathaniel stated. “But I am sure that those three women aren’t witches. There was no marking spot on any of their palms. Which means either those girls are making it up or it is someone or something else harassing them.”</p><p>“But who would be doing that?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“I guess we will have to wait and see,” Nathaniel replied.</p><h2><span id="chapter-sixteen">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-sixteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Less than a week after the hearing, Thomas and Caleb were walking home from town. It was late in the day so they decided to take a shortcut in order to reach home before dark. The land they cut across belonged to Constance Ball, a tall, well-spoken haughty woman who was known to be very wealthy. Some in Salem said she had colluded with the French and the Dutch, and those associations had brought her great riches; other townspeople whispered that she had had much more sinister beginnings.</p><p>Constance Ball’s land stretched for a couple of miles around the large and imposing house that she owned. The boys walked quickly and carefully around the tree line, wary, as they knew they were trespassing.</p><p>As they rounded the back of the property, the boys noticed the Ball family graveyard. Like many homesteads a graveyard was kept on the family land, but this one struck the Campbell boys as strange—they could see two unearthed graves on the small plot of land on the edge of the pasture. Knowing their father would want to learn more, the boys crept closer and saw two old headstones, each with a death date carved on it. Was someone digging up dead bodies?</p><p>Thomas and Caleb realized immediately that they had discovered something important. They ran the rest of the way home. When they arrived, Nathaniel was just taking his horse out.</p><p>“Father, we have something to tell you,” Caleb said, hands on his knees as he caught his breath.</p><p>“Not now boys. Another body was found,” Nathaniel said, pulling himself into his saddle. “I’ve got to go examine it and see if the neck is broken.”</p><p>“We cut through Constance Ball’s land and found two graves,” Thomas said quickly. “The bodies had been unearthed. The ground was all dug up.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” his father asked, leaning down from his saddle.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>“Well then, that’s something else to investigate,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Can we come with you?” Thomas asked eagerly.</p><p>“Aren’t you two chilled to the bone? I won’t be back until long after dark.”</p><p>“I’d rather go with you,” Caleb said.</p><p>Nathaniel shrugged and hoisted Caleb up onto a small half-saddle that sat forward on the horse and moved off, Thomas jogged by their side.</p><p>When they arrived at Reverend Parris’s parsonage, Nathaniel sent the boys to the back of the house. He was going to try to convince Reverend Parris that he should be allowed to see the latest body, but if he could not, the boys would have to try and get a look at it another way.</p><p>Shivering in the cold and dark but eager to see the latest developments, Thomas and Caleb peeked through those windows they could reach.</p><p>Inside the house, Nathaniel spoke with Reverend Parris.</p><p>“Reverend, if I may, I’d like to see the latest body that was found.”</p><p>“Absolutely not. Can’t you see what disarray my house is in?” Reverend Parris threw his arms wide. Just then, a female screamed upstairs. “As you know, my daughter and servant girl are bewitched by those vile women.”</p><p>“But the women are incarcerated—has this not stopped the affliction?” Nathaniel questioned.</p><p>Reverend Parris stared at Nathaniel.</p><p>“Satan does not rest in one place, Nathaniel. He can live anywhere, bewitch anyone. There are more witches in Salem and I aim to find them.”</p><p>“And I would like to help you. But I can only do that if I see the body.”</p><p>“The dead man was a transient. No one in town knows him. He is of no use to you,” the clergyman said.</p><p>“How did Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, and your own Tituba, kill this transient then? If they were not familiar with him, how would they have done such a thing? They’ve been in the Salem Town jail since the week before last.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Observing through the windows that their father was having little success in persuading the Reverend to let him view the body, Thomas and Caleb found their way into the root cellar beneath the house. There they found the dead body of the strange man lying on the straw floor. The cellar was dark and stuffed with cured meats and roots. A single candle illuminated the corpse.</p><p>“Feel his neck,” Caleb commanded his older brother.</p><p>“You do it,” Thomas said.</p><p>“You’re always saying you should get to do more things because you’re older. Now is your chance.” Caleb smirked.</p><p>Thomas crept reluctantly toward the body and gingerly reached his hand behind the dead man’s neck.</p><p>“He’ll get stiff now,” a small voice said from a dark corner of the cellar. “He’s been dead over an hour.”</p><p>Thomas stumbled back from the body. Caleb caught him by the arm before he crashed into a shelf of glass jars.</p><p>Prudence Lewis stepped out into the faint candlelight. She stared hard at the boys.</p><p>“You scared us,” Thomas declared angrily.</p><p>“What are you doing in Reverend Parris’s root cellar?” Caleb demanded.</p><p>“What are <span class="italic">you</span> doing?” Prudence shot back.</p><p>“We are here to examine the body,” Thomas said, taking control of the situation. “Why are you here? Aren’t you scared?”</p><p>Prudence shrugged.</p><p>“Are you still bewitched?” Thomas asked skeptically.</p><p>Prudence grinned. “Of course. Haven’t you heard what Reverend Parris said? Satan has come to Salem and is using witches to do his bidding. I’m afflicted. Just not right now.”</p><p>The boys left the strange girl in the cellar, climbed back outside and went around to the front of the house to meet their father. They waited pressed against the wall until Reverend Parris had shut the door on Nathaniel, then they approached him.</p><p>“Did you find anything?” their father asked.</p><p>“Yes. A dead body in the cellar and a strange girl,” Thomas said. He went on to describe their encounter with Prudence Lewis and the dead man’s broken neck.</p><p>“Well, I think we know who we need to try the marking spell on next,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Who?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Prudence, you dimwit.” Thomas nudged his brother in the ribs as he spoke.</p><p>“What about the empty graves?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“We’ll have to investigate further,” Nathaniel said. “But we have to ask ourselves a question first.”</p><p>“What?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“What do the witches want?” his father replied.</p><p>Dean set down the journal and looked over at Lisa sleeping in the other bed. He got up to check on Ben in the adjoining room. He had fallen asleep in front of the television.</p><p>Dean was amazed. Not only were there Campbells in Salem during the witch trials, they were also hunters. Dean flipped through a couple more pages of the journal. In the margin Nathaniel had written the witch-marking spell:</p><blockquote><p><span class="italic">Per is vox malum ero venalicium. Per is oil malum unus ero ostendo. Per is herb malum unus ero brought continuo. They mos haud diutius non exsisto notus.</span></p></blockquote><p>Dean was sure that he could use the marking spell to identify a witch to help him. He wasn’t much closer to finding a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> but he was sure if he found a witch the book would follow.</p><h2><span id="chapter-seventeen">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-seventeen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In the morning, Dean, Lisa, and Ben headed downstairs for breakfast. As Dean was finishing his coffee, Perry, the young girl from the clam shack, appeared at his elbow. Ben was visibly delighted. Dean, not so much.</p><p>“Hey there, Captain Morgan. How are you this morning?” Dean said with a good amount of snarkiness to his voice.</p><p>Perry cast a strange sideways glance at Dean.</p><p>“I’m great, Mr. Winchester. How are you?”</p><p>Dean frowned at the mention of his last name. Had Ben told her what it was? He didn’t like strangers knowing it. Best to stay under the radar in such a small town.</p><p>Despite her earlier wariness, Lisa chatted amiably with Perry. She was warming up to the girl, Dean noted. He just nodded and pretended to read the paper. Then a little blurb under the local police blotter caught his eye:</p><blockquote><p>Salem Police have found ten abandoned vehicles in the last two weeks.</p><p>All vehicles have been impounded at Salem’s Lot and Tow.</p><p>Cars will be sold at State Auction at 11:30 a.m. today if they are not claimed.</p></blockquote><p>Ten abandoned cars in two weeks is not unusual in a big city, but Salem was relatively suburban, despite its sprawl. Dean pushed himself away from the table. He really should be pursuing the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and a witch to help him, but his hunter instincts were spiked. There was something not right about that many abandoned cars in a small town.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Actually, I’m going to go check some things out. I’ll meet you back here for lunch?” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean, we said we were going to go to the clipper ships together,” Lisa said, a hint of frustration in her voice.</p><p>“I know. I know. Why don’t we go later?”</p><p>“What are we supposed to do in the meantime?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I’ll show you around,” Perry piped up.</p><p>“Yeah sure, Perry must know the place pretty well. Let her show you the town. I’ll be back soon,” Dean said.</p><p>He kissed Lisa on the cheek and left the dining room in a rush.</p><p>He drove round the block and then stopped to change into a suit, before heading out into the morning traffic.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Three car lengths behind Dean, Sam pulled the white van into the same lane.</p><p>“This van sticks out like one of Heidi Montag’s nipples. Couldn’t we get something a little less conspicuous?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Stop complaining and follow your brother,” Samuel growled. “We need to find out what he’s up to.”</p><p>“Because of these witches, right?” Sam said.</p><p>“Exactly, these witches are bad news, they’re making monsters. Netting them will make me happy,” Samuel said. “Any questions?”</p><p>Sam had plenty of questions but kept them to himself.</p><p>Dean pulled into Salem’s Lot and Tow. A skinny kid appeared from a little shack perched on the side of the lot.</p><p>“Hey man,” Dean greeted the kid, “my sister lost her car. We think it may have been stolen. Can I take a look in your lot?”</p><p>The kid shrugged.</p><p>“You’d have to prove registration and pay the fees to get it out.”</p><p>“Or you sell it,” Dean said.</p><p>“Well, not me, it goes to the police fund actually,” the kid said.</p><p>Dean nodded. He hopped out of his car and headed toward the vehicles lined up in rows.</p><p>“What kind of car did she have?” the kid asked, falling into step beside Dean.</p><p>“I’ll recognize it when I see it. Where are the ones that were found the past couple weeks?”</p><p>The kid pointed out several cars off to one side. Dean walked over to them with purpose, as if he saw one he recognized.</p><p>The first vehicle was an old red Camry, a hand-me-down to a teenager type-thing. Dean made sure the kid had gone back into his hut, and then slid into the driver’s seat. He flipped open the glove box hoping to find the registration, but it was empty. He looked underneath the seats, ran his hands over the door panels, peered under the mats, then finally noticed something shoved into the heating vent.</p><p>Popping the grate out threw a cloud of dust into the car. Inside was a small bag tied with a red string, very like the one that had made Lisa so sick. Dean cut it open with his knife and its contents fell into his lap. He identified withered herbs, a nasty bloody chicken feather and a chicken vertebra. Either the previous owner had been a witch, or a witch had put the bag in the car to keep it off the spiritual radar.</p><p>Dean heaved himself out of that car and checked the next one. Sure enough, inside was the exact same hex bag. Perhaps Dean wasn’t going to have to look far to find a witch. But why all the abandoned cars? Dean decided to see if the police had any missing person reports.</p><p>“Duck!” Samuel shouted as he saw Dean pull his car out into traffic.</p><p>Sam and Samuel were parked right outside the lot—they hadn’t expected Dean to pull out so soon. If he had turned his head to the right, he would have seen them.</p><p><span class="italic">Fortunately Dean never bothers to look both ways when pulling into traffic,</span> Sam thought to himself.</p><p>“Where’s he going now?” Samuel growled.</p><p>Sam gunned the engine and followed his brother into the traffic.</p><p>The Salem police station was a large freestanding brick affair. Sam and Samuel parked the van across the street, and watched as Dean mounted the steps to the door.</p><p>“It looks like he’s working a case, not hunting witches,” Sam observed.</p><p>“He’s all ADHD. Believe me, he’s tracking the witches,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Why are you so sure?”</p><p>“I just know,” Samuel replied tersely.</p><p>“Fine. Forget I asked,” Sam muttered, watching the door of the police station.</p><p>Inside, Dean went to the desk clerk and asked to see the missing person reports.</p><p>“Well, most of thar ain’t missing no more,” the fat desk clerk said with a thick Massachusetts accent.</p><p>Dean nodded. “I totally get the whole Barney Frank thing now.”</p><p>“Donch get yar mening.” The clerk looked perplexed.</p><p>“Can I speak to your supervisor?” Dean asked.</p><p>The desk clerk eased himself out of his seat and led Dean to his captain, an older guy who sat behind a desk in a glass-fronted office. Dean was immediately struck by the captain’s striking resemblance to Chief Wiggum in <span class="italic">The Simpsons. Sam would love this dude,</span> he thought.</p><p>Dean badged the Captain.</p><p>“Agent McBrain. Can I have a look at your local missing person reports?” Dean demanded in his best authoritative voice.</p><p>“Don’t you guys up in DC have it in your computer?” the captain responded grumpily.</p><p>“Ah yes, the computer,” Dean replied. “Well, we do, but I wanted to check for any recent ones that you hadn’t filed yet. You’ve had ten abandoned cars found these past couple of weeks. Seems to me like you might have ten reports to go with them.”</p><p>This seemed to perturb the captain.</p><p>“No need to make everyone crazy. A couple of abandoned cars don’t seem like much trouble,” he said.</p><p>Dean smirked—this guy was hiding something.</p><p>“It <span class="italic">is</span> a problem if those cars belong to missing people.”</p><p>The Captain stood up and lumbered over to a cabinet. He pulled out a thick manila file and threw it onto his desk.</p><p>“Was goin’ to wait till the summer was over.”</p><p>Dean stared at him, incredulous.</p><p>“Really? You were going to wait until the summer was over to file the reports? Why?”</p><p>The captain shrugged.</p><p>“You can’t have dead bodies coming up outta nowhere. Scares off the tourists.”</p><p>“Wait! What dead bodies?” Dean grabbed the file from the captain’s desk. He flipped through it quickly. Inside the folder were ten individual files, each with a crime scene photo attached. Nine of the ten victims were young women. “Wait a second, all these bodies you’ve found here, in Salem?” In every one of them the cause of death was listed as asphyxiation. “How did these people actually die?”</p><p>“Don’t know. Still lookin’ into it,” the captain said.</p><p>Dean was pissed. He wasn’t really a higher rank then this guy, but if he had been, he would have throttled him for sure.</p><p>“Have you reported this to the federal authorities?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“You’re here now,” the captain pointed out. “Besides, don’t hurt no one. These here are transients.” The captain pointed to the file. “Probably gangbangers from Boston.”</p><p>“She’s about as much a gangbanger as my grandmother,” Dean said, holding up one of the crime scene pictures. It depicted a young girl with blonde hair, her face mottled with bruising. Around her neck was a peace pendant.</p><p>“Gangbangers? Really?” Dean spat. “Wait until Washington hears about this!”</p><p>He thrust the file under his arm and stomped out of the office.</p><p>As he walked away, he heard the captain again mumble something about scaring off the tourists.</p><p>Outside the police station, Dean tried to calm himself down. He needed to find out who or what had killed those people; they deserved some sort of justice.</p><p>Dean opened up his cell phone and dialed a number.</p><p>A business-like male voice answered, “FBI.”</p><p>“Yeah, this is Agent McBrain from the Boston office. You need to come down to Salem and see this shit. Ten girls dead, local police playing keep-away with the information,” Dean said brusquely.</p><p>“What’s your ID number, Agent?”</p><p>“Oh, sure, I’ll give it to you. One moment. It’s 1—“ Dean hung up the phone. Hopefully, the little ruse would piqued the FBI’s interest enough to get them to follow up and do all their CSI stuff running down the wrong people. But at least that way all the families would be notified.</p><p>Dean decided to go to the coroner’s office too, even though he knew what he’d find: each cut would be exactly the same, the same depth in the neck for maximum bloodletting. It was ritualistic killing, sacrifices. The puzzle pieces still didn’t jive though. Sacrificing usually meant that someone was trying to do a really powerful spell. But for what?</p><p>On some level Dean felt a buzz, like his brain was finally kicking into gear. He was hunting. He knew what to do. This was his world.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eighteen">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-eighteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean sliced through each of the small bags so their contents scattered onto the store counter and Sukie’s bare feet.</p><p>“There are nine girls and one Justin Bieber-looking kid—all dead. All with these bags found in their cars. Why are you killing these people?” Dean growled.</p><p>As Sukie opened her mouth to speak, Dean grabbed a handful of her necklaces and pulled her close.</p><p>“And don’t give me any of that ‘I don’t know nothing about being no witch’ crap,” he breathed and then let her go.</p><p>Sukie looked genuinely scared. She glanced furtively around the store as if someone might be watching.</p><p>“Listen, it’s nothing to do with me, I’m not taking part in whatever they’re doing. I just tell them what I see and I keep to myself,” she stammered.</p><p>“So you told them about me?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Among others. I didn’t know they were killing people, I swear I didn’t. I just hear stuff. I knew something big was happening. But I don’t know what.”</p><p>“What are these bags supposed to do?” Dean asked, though he was pretty sure he knew the answer.</p><p>“They’re like invisibility bags. You know, dissipates the psychic energy of the owner so a clairvoyant can’t find them,” Sukie said.</p><p>“Who’s killing them?”</p><p>“I already told you, I don’t know,” Sukie said. “And I’m always here.” She gestured at the store.</p><p>“So where else could someone get this stuff around here?”</p><p>“Nowhere, we’re the only place. But I swear I didn’t sell any of that stuff to anyone. I open and close this place every day of the week.”</p><p>Sukie seemed to be telling the truth.</p><p>“Okay, so you’re just Bush. Who’s your Karl Rove?” Dean pressed. “Is there anyone else who could take this stuff and you wouldn’t know?”</p><p>“No... I mean the only other people who have access are Connie and her girls.”</p><p>“What are we talking, here? A witch brothel? Let me guess, everyone wears a lot of black lace, Fleetwood Mac-style?” Dean smirked.</p><p>“No, she just has girls that work for her.”</p><p>“Are they all witches?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. How many times do I have to tell you? Do you mind if I clean up now? This stuff smells.” Sukie gestured at the dust, bones, and crap before her. “If you want to know something, go ask Connie yourself.”</p><p>“One more thing. What do you need for a marking spell?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Something that marks a witch, a bad witch. Clearly not a witch-lite, like you,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t know. Do you have a spell?”</p><p>Dean took out Nathaniel Campbell’s journal and pointed to the spell written in the margin of one of the pages.</p><p>“This looks old. What’d you do? Filch this from the Peabody?”</p><p>“Something like that. Just tell me what I need.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. I mean I can only guess. I can’t tell you exactly. I’ve never seen this spell,” Sukie said hesitantly.</p><p>“Guess then,” Dean said.</p><p>“Well, I’d put a little Valerian root, some dragon’s blood and I guess a little sulfur. Might work. I’m not making any guarantees.” She moved round the store, gathering the stuff. She then wrapped it in a linen gris-gris bag. “You can try this.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said.</p><p>“Hey, just so you know, I would never be involved with anyone that killed people. Connie is a Mean Girl, you know? I’m not like that.”</p><p>Dean nodded and left the store.</p><p>It took all his self-control not to head straight to Connie’s, crash through her front gates and rip her limb from limb. It seemed he was playing with a powerful witch, and he realized how close he had come to losing Lisa. Maybe he should call Lisa and check in, just in case...</p><p>This time he wasn’t going to get caught without something to hold over Connie. He was sure that she had something to do with the dead bodies, but he had no solid evidence. He could bring her to hunter justice—bind her up and smoke her like a Virginian ham—or turn her in to the authorities. He was going to have to get proof.</p><p>Back in his car, Dean opened the police file. He decided some old-fashioned shoe leather was called for.</p><h2><span id="chapter-nineteen">CHAPTER NINETEEN</span><a href="#chapter-nineteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>From their van parked down the street, Sam and Samuel spotted Dean walk out of the store.</p><p>“You wanna follow him?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“Nah, let’s go talk to the little bitch inside,” Sam proposed.</p><p>“I thought you said she didn’t know anything,” his grandfather said skeptically.</p><p>“Well, let’s just see if she’s changed her mind.”</p><p>Samuel and Sam barged through the front door of the store to find it completely empty. The girl was gone.</p><p>Samuel gestured for Sam to go to the back while he would look upstairs. Sam headed behind the counter into the dark storage room. The back door had been fixed and it was so dark in the windowless room, he could barely see his hand in front of his face.</p><p>A floorboard creaked behind him. Sam spun around and came face to face with a strange woman with harsh features.</p><p>“I’m sorry, no returns,” she said, her voice sharp and grating. She flicked her wrist and Sam was thrown up against the opposite wall. “And no, I don’t care if you’re a Campbell.”</p><p>He tried to fight the power that held him there, but the woman was too strong. He felt an unseen weight press against his chest. The women inched her hand up higher and Sam felt himself thrown up against the ceiling, he struggled to breathe as the invisible weight continued to press down on him.</p><p>“Especially without a receipt,” she said.</p><p>“Some customer service!” Samuel growled, appearing in the doorway armed with a baseball bat. He swung high toward the woman.</p><p>“Please, you’re going to use an instrument used in a game on me?” she sneered.</p><p>“No, I’m going to use this.” Samuel pulled a salt-filled sawed-off from his hip and shot just shy of the woman’s left shoulder.</p><p>“Salt? Really? You think I’m a demon?” She smirked, then stepped up to Samuel and took a large sniff. “You’ve been dead, old man.” She pushed out her hand and Samuel started to gag. “You remember not being able to breathe? That’s right, you do. And you were dead a while. So interesting... You and I will have to have a talk some time. Right now, however, I’m going to have a little—what do you call it?—barbecue.”</p><p>With another wave of her hand, a fire started on the storeroom floor in the corner. The woman stepped to the doorway and spread a powder along the floor and the doorjamb.</p><p>“It was time I cleared out my inventory anyway.”</p><p>And with that, she disappeared through the door.</p><p>Samuel struggled to move but seemed to be held fast in place in the doorway. Sam was still pinned to the ceiling, fighting for breath. The flames spread, catching on the boxes of merchandise and reaching higher.</p><p>“How is she keeping us here?” Sam choked.</p><p>“Look for a spot of blood. She got some on you somehow. Wash it off!” Samuel managed.</p><p>Sam struggled to move at all, much less look for a spot of blood. After a few seconds he managed to prise his left arm off the ceiling and found a dot of dark-red blood on the inside of his wrist.</p><p>“How am I supposed to get it off?” he called.</p><p>The fire had climbed the tower of boxes and now reached the ceiling. The flames were creeping toward his toes.</p><p>“Spit!” Samuel shouted.</p><p>Sam tried to muster saliva from his dry mouth. He spat on his wrist, and felt the invisible restraints loosen a little bit. Fighting to get his arm down by his side, he managed to wipe his wrist against his pants. He promptly fell face-first to the floor.</p><p>Without flinching, Sam sprang back onto his feet, and stamping on the spreading flames, he moved to his grandfather’s side. He grasped his left wrist and wiped off the blood he found there.</p><p>Both free they staggered into the store, which was already filled with a thick acrid smoke.</p><p>On the floor by the front window they found the girl. Her neck lay at an unnatural angle. Sam bent over and checked her pulse anyway. She was dead.</p><p>They broke through the front door and out into the street. Still coughing, eyes streaming with the effects of the smoke, they dived into their van. Sam pulled away just as the fire trucks turned the corner.</p><p>“That was some powerful witchcraft. I’ve never seen a binding spell like that before,” Sam observed.</p><p>“She must be the witch we want,” Samuel said. “It needs someone that powerful to create something purely evil. She’s strong, and I bet she’s looking to get stronger.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Witches act like a magnet; the more witches that are around, the more power they have collectively. Someone who can cast that spell, and keep us there for that long, she’s not playing around.”</p><p>“What was the blood-binding spell? I’ve seen binding spells but never one where the person could leave the room and it still stayed in place. The only thing I know that can do that is a devil’s trap,” Sam said.</p><p>“Yeah, you probably don’t want to see that spell again either,” Samuel stated dryly.</p><p>“Why? What is it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Witch menstrual blood,” Samuel replied with just a hint of a smile.</p><p>“Agent McBrain,” Dean introduced himself, leaning over the grimy desk of the county coroner. “I need to see all the bodies that have shown up in the past two weeks. You know, the ones killed by the same Salem serial killer that everyone here seems to want to ignore.” He took back his badge and waved his hand toward the back of the basement office. “And I need to see them now.”</p><p>The elderly white-haired man behind the desk scooted out of his chair without a word and led the way to the refrigerated section of the laboratory.</p><p>“Not very chatty, are ya?” Dean observed.</p><p>“Not much to say,” the old man responded as he pulled out one of the body-sized stainless steel draws in the wall. “She was the first brought in. No identification on ‘em ‘cept a couple of tattoos.”</p><p>Job done the old dude shuffled back to his chair.</p><p>Dean examined the first young girl. A slit ran from one side of her neck to the other: it was clean, not too deep, and brutally precise. He looked for any signs of witchcraft on the body. There were no charcoal smudges or flakes of herbs, and it didn’t seem like she had been anointed for a sacrifice. But Dean noted she had defensive wounds on her hands and arms, as if she had tried to fend off her attacker.</p><p>This wasn’t a clean ritual, this kid had put up a fight.</p><p>Dean bent down slightly to get a closer look at the neck wound. As he carefully adjusted the tilt of her head, he noticed something very weird. Not only had her throat been cut—her neck was completely broken.</p><p>“This wasn’t in her report?” Dean called to the old man. The old grouch looked up, then came shuffling back toward Dean.</p><p>“What?” he asked.</p><p>“Her neck is broken. It wasn’t in your report,” Dean said. “You don’t think that’s an important thing to include? She looks like a Raggedy Ann doll!”</p><p>The old man shrugged.</p><p>Looking back at the body, Dean noticed something on the girl’s collarbone. It was a small “I Heart NYC” tattoo. Chief Wiggum was right about one thing—she was a transient. But what was she doing in Salem?</p><p>Dean checked all the other bodies. Every one of them had a broken neck. Dean sighed. Something rotten was in Salem. He had a bonafide case on his hands and that was the last thing he needed right now. All he wanted was a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and a witch and to get his brother back—was that too much to ask? Now he had ten dead bodies, and—His cell phone rang. Lisa’s number flashed insistently at him on the tiny screen—one pissed-off girlfriend.</p><p>Dean answered, “Hi babe!”</p><p>“Hey Dean. Where have you been? Is everything okay?” Lisa’s voice sounded worried.</p><p>“I’ve been, um, just around. Everything’s fine—no need to stress,” Dean said sheepishly. He really needed to come up with some good excuses for this sort of thing in advance. “How was the sightseeing?”</p><p>“It was great! I love hanging around with my pre-teen son and a girl who is coming on waaay too strong.”</p><p>“So it’s been good?” Dean said.</p><p>“No, not exactly. Are you done yet, I thought we were meeting back at the inn for lunch?”</p><p>“Okay, I just have one stop to make first,” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean—what’s this all about? Are you working a case?”</p><p>“Um, no. I don’t think so. I mean, I didn’t mean to—“</p><p>“You didn’t mean to what?” Lisa’s voice was worryingly calm.</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing,” Dean retracted quickly, sensing this was not something to get into over the phone. Especially standing in a morgue surrounded by brutally murdered young women. “I’m coming back,” he finished.</p><p>“Can you come back straight away, no stops,” Lisa said. “Ben and I are waiting for you. He wants to see the clipper ships. Today.”</p><p>“Great. Clipper ships!” Dean tried to infuse his voice with enthusiasm. “I’m on my way!” He clicked off his phone and with a last glance at the dead girls, headed for the exit. As he marched past, he noted the old coroner was paging through a Lands’ End catalog.</p><p>“Hope ya find the people that are doing this. Last time they didn’t catch anyone,” the man observed, attention still apparently on the fleece jackets in front of him.</p><p>Dean stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘last time’?”</p><p>“March of eighty-three, five dead girls. Was quite the hubbub.” The old man looked up, meeting Dean’s stare.</p><p>“March of eighty-three?” Dean repeated. Maybe it was only coincidental, but that was the same month and year that Sam was born.</p><p>Dean stepped out into the hot, hazy afternoon air. The atmosphere felt thick around him. He tried to put one foot in front of the other, but felt woozy. Both his knees failed to bend and he half-fell onto the hot cement steps. His cell phone rang again. Fumbling, Dean pulled the phone from his pocket. The screen read: SAM.</p><p>That couldn’t be. Dean stared at the number and the flashing phone sign. He hit the answer button.</p><p>“Hey Dean, it’s me, Sam. Remember? Your brother,” a voice on the other end of the line came through. Dean knew he was hallucinating. He must be hallucinating.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak but the phone kept ringing. Dean pulled the phone away and stared intently at the screen. It now read: LISA. He took a deep breath and accepted the call.</p><p>“You’re on your way, right?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Yeah, be there in a few.” He hung up. That was weird. He’d had dreams, but never hallucinations. He stumbled to his car, got in, and drove off.</p><p>Across the street, Sam watched Dean pull away.</p><p>“He do that a lot?” Samuel asked. “Have girly dizzy spells like that?”</p><p>“Nope. I’ve never seen him do that before,” Sam said, a slight look of recognition flickering across his face. There was a little something deep down there. A second later the grain of feeling, whatever it was, had disappeared again.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty">CHAPTER TWENTY</span><a href="#chapter-twenty" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>As Dean pulled up in the car he saw Lisa and Ben standing on the sidewalk, looking expectant. He tried to put on a poker face, but the phantom phone call from Sam had shaken him. However, he needn’t have worried about Lisa picking up on his discomfort.</p><p>“Hi, remember us, the people you’re on vacation with, <span class="italic">at your suggestion</span>?” she began. Not waiting for Dean to answer she pushed Ben toward the car. “Good, because you and Ben are going to go see the clipper ships together.” Ben jumped into the passenger seat. “Do not feed him any crap.”</p><p>“Do fried Twinkies constitute crap? How about beer dogs? I think I saw hotdogs fried in beer,” Dean said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>“No and no. Have fun,” Lisa said, kissing Ben and giving Dean a significant look over her son’s head, as if to say, “Remember fun?”</p><p>Dean nodded. Fun wasn’t really a concept he was comfortable with right then. He drew a breath. For Ben he would have fun. What could go wrong?</p><p>A short while later they arrived at the clipper ship that was docked on the other side of the blue-green bay. As soon as the car stopped, Ben jumped out and ran ahead.</p><p>“Hey buddy, keep your cool in check,” Dean called after him.</p><p>“Do you think there are pirates?” Ben asked as Dean caught up.</p><p>“Not sure there were pirates back in Puritan times,” Dean said. He really didn’t know—it was the kind of thing Sam would have known. “Let’s go get tickets for the tour and we can find out.” <span class="italic">Tours. Tickets. Jesus,</span> Dean thought, <span class="italic">this “fun” is turning into Mr. Rogers’ nightmare.</span></p><p>Dean noticed that there weren’t a lot of other people walking up the gangplank to the ship. It seemed as though most people—even tourists—knew to stay away from such tacky crap. The ship wasn’t even seaworthy; Dean noticed it was half-grounded on the pier. The thing wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. That was good, however. Dean wasn’t too fond of the open water and he definitely wasn’t fond of puking on his shoes. In high school he’d taken a boat trip on the Mississippi, and the unpleasant memory came back to him as soon as he set foot on the gangplank.</p><p>Ben handed him a ticket with a Jolly Roger skull and crossbones on it.</p><p>“This is going to be great,” Ben said, leading the way to the gloomy anteroom which was the start of the tour. “And it looks like we have the whole tour to ourselves!”</p><p>“Are we late?” a voice said.</p><p>A pudgy old woman in a clinging powder-blue belted leisure suit, who clearly thought she was Super-Grandma, stepped into the room behind them. She held the hand of a little girl, about five years old, with a face like a mashed potato and a mouth rimmed with a red candy coating. The little girl’s sticky-fingered other hand grasped at Dean’s pant leg.</p><p>“Hands off the threads, Veruca Salt.” Dean cringed and stepped away.</p><p>“Dakota darling, leave the man alone,” Super-Gran said mildly.</p><p>“Ahoy there! Are ye all ready for a tour of the creakiest, creepiest ship to ever set sail the high seeeaass?” An old guy in a pirate costume leapt out from behind a plastic barrel.</p><p>“Ahhhh. Memaw!” The little girl screamed and pulled her grandmother back out toward the ticket counter.</p><p>“Guess not,” Dean observed under his breath.</p><p>“We are,” Ben said.</p><p>“Argh, grreaaat!” the old man said.</p><p>“That was a little more Tony the Tiger than Jack Sparrow,” Dean noted.</p><p>The guide gave him the evil eye.</p><p>“You can be me grommet. Would ye like that?” he asked Ben.</p><p>“Totally!” Ben said. “Can we see the Gibbet first?”</p><p>“Ye know a lot about pirates, mate,” the man said. “Just don’t get too pushy. I got a system,” he added, without the accent.</p><p>“We’re going to start foreword on the ship at the forecastle,” he continued, re-discovering the accent. “This is where the sayy-lors slept.” The pirate guide led the way as they walked toward the front of the ship.</p><p>Ben turned to Dean and shrugged.</p><p>“There’s a lot on the Internet. Pirates are cool,” he said.</p><p>After walking through a narrow hallway they entered a small dusty room with bunkbeds attached to each wall.</p><p>“‘Tis where the picaroons slept,” the man said.</p><p>“Hey dude, you don’t need to do the accent the whole time. I mean, we appreciate it and all, but, ya know, <span class="italic">not</span> necessary,” Dean told the guy. The mock-pirate regarded him for a moment with tired eyes.</p><p>“Really? ‘Cause this day sort of sucked,” he admitted.</p><p>“Yeah. Relax. Just let us wander around,” Ben said.</p><p>The guy nodded gratefully. “Okay. Just don’t tell my boss. You guys seem cool, so how about I show you some of the places that the public doesn’t get to see? I’m Teddy, by the way.” He shook hands with each of them.</p><p>“Dean and Ben,” Dean said. “Nice to meet you. Yeah, totally—show us the good stuff. Right, Ben?”</p><p>Ben nodded eagerly.</p><p>They followed Teddy to the main deck. Ben ran around pointing out where the swords were kept, and how the sails were steered. Teddy then led them down to the deck below, where the cannons were kept. It was a large nearly bow-to-stern open floor with imposing black cannons sticking out of a line of holes on each side of the ship.</p><p>“Do these work?” Ben asked, running toward one.</p><p>“Aw no,” Teddy said smiling, “these cannons have all been cemented up for decades. They used to shoot twenty-four pound balls. Boys like you would run up and down bringing gunpowder from the bottom of the ship to set them off.”</p><p>“You still have the cannonballs?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Gosh, no. They melted down whatever was found a long time ago.”</p><p>“So what’s this?” Ben asked, rolling a large cannonball across the floor.</p><p>Teddy looked surprised.</p><p>“That isn’t supposed to be there—where did you find that?”</p><p>“Yeah, I suspect we shouldn’t be here either,” Dean said, pointing out of one of the cannon holes. Teddy ran to the hole and peered out.</p><p>They were in the middle of the open sea.</p><p>“How the holy hell did that happen?” Teddy cried.</p><p>“I think he might be able to tell us,” Ben said, pointing to a tall, thin figure at the other end of the deck.</p><p>The figure limped toward them. As it moved closer, Dean could see it was a man. He appeared slightly translucent at first, but with each step he took, he became more and more solid, until he stood about twenty feet in front of them. He was dressed in a ruffled high-collar shirt with knee-high swashbuckler boots over tight trousers. A long silver sword hung from his belt.</p><p>He didn’t look happy.</p><p>“Nice shirt,” Dean observed.</p><p>The ghost turned his milky eyes toward them.</p><p>“Dean?” Ben had backed up against Dean, his eyes as wide as saucers.</p><p>“You know how you keep bugging me to teach you how to hunt?” Dean said calmly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Ben said.</p><p>“Hunt? Hunt what?” Teddy was frozen to the spot, staring at the pirate.</p><p>“Pissed off pirate ghosts,” Dean replied.</p><p>“What do you do first?” Ben asked, shuffling around behind Dean.</p><p>“Run!” Dean yelled as he pushed Ben and Teddy toward a door in the aft of the ship.</p><p>“Arrgh, ye scalliwags ain’t going to gull me!” the pirate shouted. Dean looked back to see him limping after them.</p><p>“No one is gulling anything with kids in the room,” Dean said, pulling an iron knife from his jacket and swinging at the pirate. His reach was too short, so he threw the knife at the apparition, but Captain Scalliwag was quicker than he looked and swiftly side-swiped it away with his sword.</p><p>“Through there. Now!” Dean directed Ben and Teddy toward the door.</p><p>“But ghosts aren’t real!” Teddy screamed, tripping over the threshold.</p><p>Dean pushed Ben through after Teddy, then leapt through himself. He spun around and slammed the door behind him just as the pirate’s sword blade cracked through the wood.</p><p>“Looks pretty damn real to me,” Dean said, ushering them forward into the dark of the ship.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-one">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“How did that happen? And what do we do now?” Teddy cried as he led the way down some steps.</p><p>Dean shook his head. “I don’t know. We could have passed through a portal of some sort. Could be a curse, a spell... Has anything like this ever happened before?”</p><p>“No, never,” Teddy said, “and I’ve worked here since college.”</p><p>Dean raised an eyebrow. Teddy was pushing fifty. Just then, a cacophony of harangues and the stomp of heavy boots on the deck above marched over their heads.</p><p>“Seems like there are more of them now,” Ben said.</p><p>“Is there any salt on this ship?” Dean asked Teddy.</p><p>“Should be, we use it on the gangplank during the winter,” Teddy said. “We usually keep large sacks of it in the galley.”</p><p>“Okay, well, that’s our second stop. First, where are the guns?”</p><p>“There aren’t any! We don’t keep guns on the ship.”</p><p>“Well, I would say there aren’t any pirates, but I’m pretty sure they’re here. So where would they have stored guns on a working pirate ship?” Dean said.</p><p>Teddy shrugged.</p><p>“Gunpowder room?” Ben suggested.</p><p>Teddy nodded. “Right.”</p><p>Dean punched Ben lightly on the shoulder and the boy straightened proudly.</p><p>Teddy took them down a long staircase to the very bottom of the boat.</p><p>“Through here,” he said.</p><p>“You can’t go in thar,” said a voice behind them.</p><p>The trio swung around. A craggy old sea dog was shackled beneath the stairway.</p><p>“What are you going to do about it, Golem?” Dean challenged.</p><p>“If I wasn’t chained up I would disembowel you,” the old sailor retorted.</p><p>“You look like you could use a colonoscopy yourself,” Dean said, bending down and taking out his pocket knife. He stuck it in the crevice between the floorboards and popped up one of the old planks.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Putting this poor cranky guy out of his misery,” Dean said. He stuck his arm down the hole in the floor and pulled out a human skull.</p><p>“Wha’d’ye have there?” the sea dog asked.</p><p>“Hold it, Yorick.” Sticking his hand back in the hole, Dean pulled out a moldy burlap bag. Inside was a collection of bones. Dean put the skull into the bag, then produced a small tin box of salt from a pocket, which he poured onto the bag.</p><p>“RIP old man.”</p><p>Dean lit his Zippo lighter and held the flame underneath the bag. It lit up instantly, burning bright. The old ghost started to scream.</p><p>Not waiting around to see what happened next, Dean pushed Ben through the door to the gunpowder room. Inside, the room was filled floor to ceiling with large barrels of gunpowder and an array of guns.</p><p>“This wasn’t here before,” Teddy said, amazed.</p><p>“Yeah, well, we don’t want it to be either,” Dean said. “The longer a supernatural force stays in this realm the more energy it gathers, and these ghosts are going to get all cozy in the present. So let’s get them the hell out of here. Gather all the iron pistols you can.”</p><p>“Even me?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Yeah, this <span class="italic">one</span> time, even you.” Dean handed him a flintlock pistol that was as long as Ben’s forearm.</p><p>“Pull back on this, aim, then pull the trigger,” Dean instructed. “This hammer will create a spark, but it might take a second to fire.”</p><p>“What about your <span class="italic">real</span> gun?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I didn’t know there were going to be ghost pirates,” Dean said, filling Ben’s pockets with handfuls of iron pellets. “I left it in the car.”</p><p>BANG!</p><p>The door rattled as buckshot hit the other side.</p><p>“They’re trying to shoot their way in,” Dean said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>The trio grabbed as many muskets and pistols as they could hold and climbed up the ladder at the far end of the room, emerging through a door into yet another part of the ship.</p><p>“This way!” Teddy cried, leading them through a small door.</p><p>“Um, Dean?” Ben stuttered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How do I use this again? Because I think I’m gonna need to,” Ben said, thumbing behind his shoulder. Dean looked down. The pirate ghosts had broken through the door and were now stomping through the artillery, gathering as they went. Now they climbing the ladder.</p><p>“Help me with these barrels!” Dean called to Teddy. They lifted three large barrels full of tar to the door, blocking it. More yells and shouts from the pirates echoed through the ship.</p><p>“Come on! We don’t have much time,” Dean said, urging the others on. “What’s the highest point on the ship? We need to get an advantage.”</p><p>“The poop deck! Follow me,” Teddy said.</p><p>Dean shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Teddy said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Ben, Teddy and Dean scampered up the deck. The ship was steadily making its way into the Atlantic; only a rim of land could be seen on the horizon. Peering into the open sea, Dean felt a momentary lurch of seasickness. He took a deep breath and tried to ignore the tilting of the deck beneath his feet.</p><p>The vessel had been completely transformed into its former, seaworthy glory. The deck was full of everything one would need for a long sea voyage: rope, tar, even animals.</p><p>“How did this stuff get here?” Teddy was aghast. “This is on the National Historical Registry. They can’t bring livestock onto a national treasure,” he said, pointing to a goat that bleated at them then scampered away.</p><p>Seconds later a slew of pirates appeared. Dean counted forty confused and pissed-off buccaneers gathered at the bow of the ship, then the pirate from the gun deck stepped forward.</p><p>“I’ll not have mutiny on my ship, mate,” he called.</p><p>Dean stepped forward.</p><p>“Well, I think we’ll hang around. I think it’s time you retired from raping and pillaging anyway. How about throwing in the towel? Go down to Boca. You know, relax.”</p><p>“Why don’t ye just get off?”</p><p>“Yeah dude, that means something different now. Okay,” Dean said to Ben and Teddy, “when they advance, I want you to calmly—“</p><p>“Fire!” Teddy cried as he ineptly aimed his pistol at the ghosts.</p><p>Dean shrugged.</p><p>“Yeah, fire.” He cocked an ancient pistol and fired into the crowd of oncoming surly sailors. An iron ball exploded out of the musket and hit a peg-legged pirate square in the eye, instantly vaporizing him.</p><p>“You got him!” Teddy said.</p><p>“He’ll be back, and more pissed off. This is just to buy us some time,” Dean said, letting off a two-handed barrage of gunfire. Another ghost vaporized, then a couple of seconds later re-materialized, stumbling, in the same place. “Ben, we need salt. Go find the galley!”</p><p>Ben scampered off as Teddy and Dean held the motley crew of pirates at bay. A few minutes later he returned, dragging a large sack of rock salt.</p><p>“Got it!” he called.</p><p>Dean cut open the sack and grabbed it at the base. He heaved a large semi-circle of salt around them. The ghost who seemed to be the captain of the motley crew charged the salt line but couldn’t cross it.</p><p>“I’ll get ye,” he growled.</p><p>“Okay, Captain Crunch, keep your breeches on.” Dean refilled his gun and shot him between the eyes. The ghost vaporized but then re-materialized. Teddy took a swing at him with a iron loading rod. It split the ghost in two. But just for a moment.</p><p>“Ah, Dean!” Ben cried.</p><p>A pirate had climbed up the outside of the ship and was now steadily forcing Ben to walk along the plank on the stern of the ship. Dean took aim at the pirate’s back but Ben was directly behind him—he couldn’t take a shot without hitting Ben too.</p><p>“Ben, stay calm. Aim your pistol at him and shoot!” Dean directed.</p><p>“It’s jammed!” the boy called. Tears were streaming down Ben’s cheeks.</p><p>“Throw it at him!” Dean yelled.</p><p>Ben hefted his gun at the ghost, but the grizzly pirate caught it deftly and instead aimed it at Ben.</p><p>“Duck!” Dean cried as he aimed and shot at the ghost. Ben hit the plank as the shot ripped through the ghost. Dean jumped to the plank and pulled Ben up and behind him.</p><p>The ghost quickly came back.</p><p>“Teddy! Shoot!” Dean screamed.</p><p>Teddy rotated a cannon, then lit the fuse. The ball rumbled out of the opening and arced toward the ghost. It obliterated the specter and punched through the stern of the boat.</p><p>“We have to turn this ship around. Teddy can you do that?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I can try,” Teddy replied. He jumped over the salt line, caught a hanging rope and in a move that would have made Indiana Jones proud, swung to the other side of the deck, landing at the wheel.</p><p>“Ben, see that little dinghy right there?” Dean pointed. “Start lowering it down. When Teddy gets the ship turned around, you set it in the water and get in. You understand?”</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I’m going to make sure these pirates don’t reach land,” Dean said determinedly. He spotted a thick length of rope. Simultaneously shooting at ghosts, he dragged the rope over to a large barrel of tar, dunked in the entire rope, some two-hundred pounds’ worth, then threw it over the side of the ship.</p><p>He called out to Ben, “Ben, grab the other end of the rope and don’t let go. Okay?”</p><p>Ben waved as he fought to lower the dinghy on a pulley.</p><p>Meanwhile, Teddy pulled at the wheel and the ship began to turn in a big lazy curve.</p><p>The pirates all shot to one side of the deck, giving them temporary relief from attack.</p><p>Dean took the opportunity to throw salt mixed with gun powder in lines across the deck. Then he carefully lit each line. In moments an enormous crosshatch of fire spread across the surface of the ship.</p><p>Dean raced across the deck to help Teddy at the wheel. Perched on a turret, struggling against the ancient ring of wood, Teddy heroically stood fast and hung on, making sure the ship made a full turn. Dean kicked and shot at oncoming ghosts. A long-haired pirate attacked and Dean beheaded him with an iron sword. The pirate vaporized then reappeared just three feet away.</p><p>“Come closer, I want to rip your heart out an’ eat it for me dinner,” Hairy declared.</p><p>“Sorry, I’m not free for lunch, Long John Silver,” Dean said, swinging the iron sword again and knocking the ghost clear onto the other side of a burning salt line. Dean turned back toward the turret just as another pirate climbed over a railing and snuck up behind Teddy.</p><p>“Teddy, watch out!” Dean shouted.</p><p>The pirate swung his sword.</p><p>It cut straight through Teddy’s torso.</p><p>Teddy turned around and gasped. The ghost jumped onto him and stuck his hand inside his chest. Teddy’s eyes saucered wide, he clutched at his heart, then fell forward onto the wheel.</p><p>The ship pitched right, debris tumbled off the deck, a couple of ghosts plunged into the churning water. Dean raised his gun and shot at Teddy’s killer. The pirate vaporized, then came back. Dean shot at him again and raced to Teddy’s side. He was dead. <span class="italic">Crap, poor guy.</span> He glanced quickly over his shoulder to see if Ben had witnessed Teddy’s violent end. <span class="italic">Better if the boy doesn’t know what happened.</span></p><p>Dean took another length of rope and tied the wheel of the ship so it was headed straight toward shore. He jumped onto the railing, shoved the gun in the waistband of his jeans, and pulled a hanging piece of rope close.</p><p>“Anything to do with Tarzan—always a bad idea,” he muttered. He held on tight and heaved himself off the railing. The rope arced low over the length of the deck like a pendulum. Dean kicked and stabbed a couple of pirates as they clamored and grasped at his heels. At the top of the trajectory, Dean jumped off and pushed Ben into the dinghy.</p><p>“Tour’s over.”</p><p>Dean grabbed the tar-coated rope, and took a bag of gunpowder out of his pocket. He plastered it onto the end of the rope and lit it with his Zippo.</p><p>“Cut the rope!”</p><p>Ben produced a machete and cut the pulley rope. The dinghy swung out and hung for a second, then dropped harshly into the water.</p><p>The first explosion bloomed from the deck, rocketing flaming debris over the sides of the ship toward the dinghy.</p><p>“Row, row hard!” Dean urged.</p><p>Ben and Dean pulled at the oars, straining against the pull of the ship as it surged forward. They were caught in its wake. The two vessels were quickly approaching shore. But as furiously as Ben and Dean tried to row away from the ship, its thrust made it impossible to maneuver out of its grasp.</p><p>“Where’s Teddy?” Ben shouted over the roar of the explosions.</p><p>“He’s fine,” Dean replied, looking sadly back at the ship. “Don’t worry about him.” Ben was too breathless from rowing to press him further.</p><p>The top deck caught fire as a series of smaller explosions ripped tank-sized holes in the side of the ship. Dean and Ben bobbed alongside the flaming fireball.</p><p>“We need to push ourselves away from the ship,” Dean called.</p><p>Ben nodded. “We need a cannon or something.”</p><p>Dean thought a moment. He looked around them, they were surrounded by debris bobbing in the churning water. What could he use?</p><p>“Help me get this thing in the boat,” Dean instructed. He and Ben leaned over the side of the small craft, careful not to let it capsize, and pulled a cracked nine-foot-long piece of mast from the water.</p><p>Another explosion ripped through the back of the ship, shooting the cast-iron stove into the water. Seeing a solution, Dean paddled and managed to get to the pipe which let out the smoke. He pried it off the sinking stove and grabbed a floating plank of wood.</p><p>“We need to nail this plank onto the bottom of this pipe. Find nails, whatever you can,” Dean said.</p><p>As the ship sped toward the shore, Dean and Ben struggled to stay afloat as they fished pieces of debris out of the water and using the handle of Ben’s machete managed to nail the plank onto the pipe. Dean shoved a bag of gunpowder down the end of the pipe and then, with difficulty, positioned the pipe against the bow of the dinghy and the plank that ran across as a second seat. They heaved the mast into the pipe, and turned the dinghy’s bow toward the ship.</p><p>“Hold onto the stern, Ben. As soon as you feel the boat shoot forward—you kick!”</p><p>“Kick? Why?”</p><p>“‘Cause this puppy is going to tear this thing apart like a chew toy,” Dean warned. He lit a piece of tarred rope and dropped it into the pipe. “Hold tight!”</p><p>The pipe sizzled and cracked, then the gunpowder shot the mast out of the pipe. The mast was so long that it hit the ship while still in contact with the pipe. The dinghy shot forward, freeing itself from the wake of the ship. The explosion ripped the dinghy’s stern off and Dean and Ben’s legs dipped into the cold water. They both gasped.</p><p>“Kick!” Dean yelled.</p><p>They kicked the front half of the dinghy away from the ship. The sails were aflame, and the top of the ship was charring to black. The floating inferno narrowly missed a leisure tour boat. As the water calmed, closer to shore, the ship took a slow curve, as if it was trying to steer itself back to its old position. The flaming mass of wood and rope plowed into the old dock, throwing up debris onto the parking lot and a crowd of gaping tourists.</p><p>A fireball burst from the ship, instantly burning up the remaining ghosts on board. The inferno washed over the old wooden pier, setting alight a car which had the misfortune of being parked in the closest handicap space.</p><p>Fire trucks zoomed in from all corners of the parking lot. A crowd gathered behind them.</p><p>Dean and Ben continued to kick toward the shore. As the water became shallower, Dean pushed himself off the dinghy and pulled it onto the sandy beach. He paused for a moment, breathing deeply.</p><p>“Dean! Ben!” He heard Lisa scream from the rocks above the beach.</p><p>Dean helped Ben out of the water and the two of them climbed over the rocks; sandy, wet, and exhausted.</p><p>Lisa grasped Ben, hugging him despite the soaking, dirty state of him.</p><p>“What happened? You were supposed to go on a quiet boat tour—while docked!” Lisa said, looking incredulously at the damage.</p><p>“There were ghosts, Mom. Pirate ghosts,” Ben said. “But we got them—we burned them and shot them. It was very cool.”</p><p>Lisa looked at Dean.</p><p>“Did he touch a gun?”</p><p>“Lis, that’s not the point. This was a ‘three-hour tour’ from hell,” Dean responded. “Besides, he wasn’t half bad with a flintlock.” He ruffled Ben’s hair.</p><p>“He touched a gun!” Lisa’s eyes were wide and angry. “I said no guns. Ever.”</p><p>“You know, Lisa, we could stand around here and talk this over, but I think maybe the police are going to want to... Maybe we should leave.”</p><p>“Why does destruction follow you wherever you go?” she asked despairingly.</p><p>“This really wasn’t my fault. Right, Ben?” Dean slung his arm around Ben’s shoulder. “The pirates came after us first.”</p><p>“Why would pirates come after you?” Lisa said. “What did you do to them?”</p><p>“They’re ghosts, Lisa, it doesn’t really work that way,” Dean said, looking away toward the rapidly growing crowd of onlookers.</p><p>“Hey Dean, where’s Teddy? Is he still on the ship?” Ben looked anxiously at the burned remains of the pirate vessel.</p><p>Dean ran a hand through his hair. No way could he tell the kid what had really happened. He’d been through enough that day already.</p><p>“He’s all right. I think he’s over there.” Dean pointed vaguely across the parking lot.</p><p>Then he spotted her. Across the parking lot, a tall, tight-faced woman in a dark coat, staring straight at them.</p><p>“Well, how does it work?” Lisa said, trying to get Dean’s attention. “Dean?”</p><p>The woman continued to stare at Dean over the commotion in the parking lot. He’d never seen her before, but there was something about her that was both familiar and threatening.</p><p>“Dean? Dean, I’m talking to you. Is there something I should know about? Are more ghosts going to come after us?”</p><p>Dean took hold of Lisa’s shoulders and stared into her eyes.</p><p>“No. I promise. They won’t,” he said, firmly. “But you have to trust me and do what I tell you: Go back to the hotel and don’t open the door to <span class="italic">anybody.</span> Okay?”</p><p>“Dean, you’re scaring me. What is going on?” Lisa looked back at him, eyes wide.</p><p>“Can I be that guy and say I’ll explain later?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You know in the movies that never works out,” Lisa replied.</p><p>“I know. But you have to trust me on this. Everything is going to be fine. I came here for something, but I just think I stepped into something bigger.”</p><p>“So unlike you.” Lisa managed to crack a slight smile. “Go. We’ll be fine.”</p><p>Lisa hugged Ben close, as if reassuring herself that he was still with her and all in one piece. Dean nodded then swung around and beelined toward the crowd, but the woman was nowhere to be seen. He fumbled for his car keys in the pocket of his wet jeans. Miraculously, they were still there. He jumped into the car and sped off.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Dean pulled up in front of the charred remains of Connie’s Curios and Conversations. A policeman and a county coroner were pushing a white body bag into the back of a van.</p><p>Dean jumped out of the car and ran up to them.</p><p>“Hey dude, who is that?” he asked.</p><p>“Poor girl who worked there. Burned up like a crisp. Don’t know why she didn’t even try to get out,” the county coroner replied, slamming the door shut.</p><p>Dean stared after the van as it chugged away. He got back in his car, flipped a bitch, and headed north to Connie Hennrick’s place.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-two">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean was reeling from the death of Sukie. Apart from the incident with the baseball bat, the kid had been harmless enough. <span class="italic">I guess it proves you can’t “dabble” in witchcraft. Dangerous shit like that always catches up with you eventually.</span> But Dean wished he’d been able to save Sukie. She hadn’t deserved to die.</p><p>Sukie’s death, combined with his <span class="italic">Titanic</span> moment and Teddy’s death, sent Dean into an emotional spiral. He had certainly stumbled onto a case, something big which needed his attention. He still wanted to find a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> to raise Sam, but it was clear that the brutal killings, the hex bags, and the pirate ghosts, that something was going on and someone was trying to stop him from finding out what it was.</p><p>Dean headed north looking for the Hennrick farm, following signs to Ipswich Road. The road curved through woods. After a mile or two the trees bent over the blacktop, cutting out the gray sky. Dean slowed at a large iron gate with a decorative “H” mounted onto the face. He pulled up twenty meters further on and stopped. Dean took out Nathaniel’s journal and started to read.</p><p>Nathaniel and his boys set out the next day to visit the Widow Faulkner. Nathaniel wanted to pay his respects as she’d lost a daughter. But his curiosity had also been piqued when Hannah mentioned that Abigail Faulkner was in a quilting circle with Reverend Parris’s daughter, the girl who had been bewitched for two weeks. It seemed strange that almost to the day that the bewitching started, Abigail’s body had been found. Did the two events have anything to do with one another?</p><p>Rose Mary wrapped up a loaf of freshly baked bread, and handed it to Nathaniel to put in his pack. It was widely known that since John Faulkner had died five years ago, his widow had struggled to feed her children and keep her small farm. Taking a little something for the family to eat was an appropriate gesture, especially after the loss of a child. At least that was Nathaniel’s reasoning as he, Caleb, and Thomas set out.</p><p>What they reached the widow’s homestead, they were surprised to find, rather than a rundown and poverty-stricken house, a prosperous little residence. The previously empty barn held two horses and two cows, quite a luxury in Salem.</p><p>Nathaniel rapped on the door. Widow Faulkner invited them into, not a cold unforgiving room, but a warm and cozy interior. There was food on the table and what smelled to Nathaniel like venison stew bubbling away on the hearth. That season had been particularly bad for hunting and someone would have had to be a very fortunate to bring home a catch of fresh deer.</p><p>Nathaniel formally introduced the boys to the widow. He passed on Rose Mary’s condolences and added that he and the boys would be happy to do anything around the house if the family needed help. She declined politely, explaining that she was comfortable and had plenty of food for her and her two remaining children.</p><p>“And how are the twins? I seem to recall they have some difficulty walking,” Nathaniel enquired.</p><p>“They are quite fine, thank you. Here they come now,” the widow said, straightening in her chair.</p><p>Two identical boys about Caleb’s age sprinted through the door and into the common room where the Campbells sat. Both looked healthy and ruddy, with not a sign of a limp between them. Whatever affliction had caused their lameness was completely gone.</p><p>Nathaniel wondered how a widow could go so quickly from abject poverty to living comfortably.</p><p>“Widow Faulkner, I’m so very sorry about the loss of your daughter,” Nathaniel said earnestly, watching the woman’s reaction.</p><p>“The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Isn’t that what Reverend Parris says?” she replied evenly.</p><p>“Indeed. You are correct. It seems that you want for nothing, however,” Nathaniel said, gesturing at the evidence of comfort around them.</p><p>“Except my daughter. I would do anything to have my daughter back,” the widow said.</p><p>“Of course. Tell me, did she have very many friends? Perhaps she was acquainted with Reverend Parris’s daughter?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>“No, not at all. On Sundays and Thursday evening prayers, perhaps they spoke. But they were by no means friends.”</p><p>This was not the response Nathaniel had expected. He nodded solemnly, repeated his regrets, and indicated to Thomas and Caleb that it was time to leave.</p><p>Once outside, Nathaniel shook his head. He was confused. He had been sure the bewitched girls would have some link to Abigail’s death.</p><p>As Nathaniel mounted his horse, the widow appeared at her door. She gestured to Nathaniel.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, there is one more thing,” she said.</p><p>“What’s that?” asked Nathaniel.</p><p>“I loved my daughter, but I didn’t agree with some of the company she kept.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>The widow looked around nervously, even though no one was around.</p><p>“Like the Ball family,” she said finally. With that she nodded politely and went back inside.</p><p>Nathaniel looked at his two boys.</p><p>“Feel like a visit to Constance Ball’s house? This may be a link to those unearthed graves you saw on her property.”</p><p>Caleb and Thomas nodded. Constance Ball’s daughters were notorious throughout Salem Village. They never seemed to want to talk to anyone except each other, and they were also all strikingly beautiful.</p><p>The Ball residence was located not far from the Campbell family home, hence Thomas and Caleb occasionally cutting across their land, though they knew they shouldn’t. The house was an impressive brick affair, its building material alone setting it apart from most of the nearby residences, which were clapboard. The one singular thing about the Balls everyone in Salem knew was that ever since anyone could remember, they had lived on that land, and in that house.</p><p>“Do you think Constance Ball has something to do with Abigail’s death?” Thomas asked as he trotted alongside his father.</p><p>“I guess we will find out,” Nathaniel said. “Do you know what to do once we are invited inside?”</p><p>The boys nodded. This was exactly the kind of situation Nathaniel had trained them for. They had sat up for long nights in freezing weather staking out potential vampire nests. They had seen their share of demon possessions. But Nathaniel also taught them how to be polite enough to be invited into a home, which was sometimes half the battle.</p><p>By the time the Campbells reached Constance Ball’s house, a great wind had whipped up. Snow blew across the open fields, blinding them as they approached. Nathaniel tied up his horse and they ascended the steps. The door knocker was as big as Caleb’s head. Thomas pried it from the door and let it fall against its brass base. Even over the wind the CLACK! could be heard echoing through the building.</p><p>A minute or two later a large man in black pants and jacket, the kind that buttoned all the way to the collar, opened the door, revealing a grand entranceway and a sweeping staircase. Nathaniel introduced himself and asked to be let in. The man led Nathaniel and the boys into a large living area to the right of the grand hallway.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb had never been in such a big house. Once inside, they found places next to the large roaring fire as they waited for the lady of the house. Nathaniel immediately recognized a couple of curious artifacts around the room, most notably a small worn-looking book perched on a podium. He peered at the first page—it was written entirely in Latin.</p><p>He heard the boys gasp as a long index finger suddenly closed the book in his face. Nathaniel looked up and found himself face to face with Constance Ball. She was a handsome woman, always well-coiffed, almost in a Renaissance style, but specifically overdressed for a colonial woman.</p><p>“May I help you?” she asked.</p><p>“Madam Ball, I’m Nathaniel Campbell and these are my sons, Caleb and Thomas.” The boys bowed politely.</p><p>“I know who you are,” she said. “Your property abuts mine. Is there a problem? Did one of my girls trespass?”</p><p>“No, not at all. Though perhaps you wouldn’t mind if I spoke with your daughters?”</p><p>“What for?” Constance asked.</p><p>“I’d like to know if they were acquainted with Abigail Faulkner,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>Constance affected a frown of deep thought.</p><p>“I’m quite sure I don’t know the name,” she said after a moment. She sat down in a straight-backed chair and glared coldly at Nathaniel.</p><p>“That’s strange,” Nathaniel said. “For her mother, Widow Faulkner, said that her daughter knew you and your girls.”</p><p>“I’m not sure what you are aiming at,” Constance said.</p><p>“You do know that little Abigail Faulkner is dead?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>Constance paused before replying.</p><p>“No, I’m not sure that I did. Exactly what are you getting at, Mr. Campbell?”</p><p>During the exchange, Thomas and Caleb had crept behind Constance’s chair. Caleb pulled a small bag from his pocket and tried to place it under her seat. Constance whirled around instantly, startling the boy.</p><p>“What are you doing down there, you little monkey?” she demanded.</p><p>Nathaniel stepped in.</p><p>“I’m sorry, he’s a strange boy. Caleb, come here.” Caleb did as he was told and took his place beside his father.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, I’ve had just enough of your tomfoolery. You can leave now,” Constance declared, rising from her chair.</p><p>“I don’t think you understand,” Nathaniel replied.</p><p>“Rathburn,” she called. “Show these gentlemen out.” The large man materialized in the doorway as though he had been listening behind it all along. He marched across the room and grasped Nathanial by the arm.</p><p>Nathaniel pulled his arm away from Rathburn’s vice-like grip.</p><p><span class="italic">“Per is vox malum ero venalicium. Per is oil malum unus ero ostendo.”</span> Nathaniel started to chant the Latin marking spell.</p><p>Constance smiled serenely.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, if you wanted to know if I was a witch, why didn’t you just ask?” With a casual flick of her wrist, Caleb went flying against the bookcases.</p><p>“Daadd!” Caleb’s small body twisted up against the wall.</p><p>Nathaniel unsheathed the knife hidden beneath his coat.</p><p>“You think you can hurt me with that pig sticker? Mr. Campbell, you don’t know me or what I’m capable of.” She whirled her arm around and the room became filled with a gale as powerful as the one outside.</p><p>Constance turned to face Nathaniel. Another small hand gesture sent him flying across the room.</p><p>Thomas tried to tackle Constance, but she flipped him end over end into the corner.</p><p>“I’ll not be attacked in my own home, you silly fool.” Constance waved her hand again. The fire leaped out of the fireplace and began to swirl in a tornado up toward the ceiling. <span class="italic">“Eugae satan imus focales olle obligamus tu adque subsidium me clades mi trespassers,”</span> Constance shouted.</p><p>The fire burned closer and closer to Thomas, who lay in a heap on the floor, unconscious.</p><p>“Thomas! Wake up!” Caleb shouted.</p><p>“Oh, isn’t that curious, your eldest seems to have lost his senses. Just like his father,” Constance sneered. She stood regal as the fiery tornado swirled around her. “Tell me, Nathaniel, why would you bring your children here? Why put them in danger? Oh, I know why—you’re a hunter. All hunters are the same. Blow-hards who think they have the right to judge everyone but themselves. Let me tell you something,” she leaned her face close to Nathaniel’s, her breath was icy cold on his face, “we came here, same as you, for a new life. The New World is for everyone, not just those with their nose in a Bible.”</p><p>“You killed Abigail Faulkner, an innocent young girl,” Nathaniel spat back at her.</p><p>Constance shrugged and turned away from him.</p><p>“So what if I did. Sometimes the weak have to be punished for insubordination.”</p><p>“Salem won’t stand for this,” Nathaniel yelled at her back.</p><p>“Please, Salem is doing a good job of extinguishing all rational thought. Don’t you think, girls?” Constance turned to address five young women standing in the doorway. The flames reflected in their very dark eyes.</p><p>Constance turned back around and stared coldly at Nathaniel.</p><p>“Let’s get one thing straight, Mr Campbell: I could kill you, it would be as easy as this.” She clicked her fingers. “If you cross me again, your children will be orphans. I’ll make sure of that.” She raised her hand up, hovering near Nathaniel face. “And next time, I will not be so merciful.”</p><p>Three large deep scratches appeared across Nathaniel’s cheek, sending blood dribbling down his chin onto his coat.</p><p>“I can control many things,” she hissed. “Nowhere in Salem is safe. Girls, show the Campbells the way out.”</p><p>The five girls gathered in a circle, raised up their hands, and with a flick of their wrists Nathaniel, Thomas, and Caleb blew through the glass-paned glass windows and landed on the snow outside. The gale wrapped around them. Thomas was still unconscious as Nathaniel lifted him onto the horse and they limped away.</p><p>Rose Mary opened the door as Nathaniel, Thomas, and Caleb approached the house.</p><p>“What on earth?” she cried. “Hannah, go get the herbs and oils.”</p><p>Nathaniel gently laid Thomas on the table. Caleb tugged off his brother’s boots, and Hannah pressed a warm compress of medicinal plants against Thomas’s temple.</p><p>“What happened?” Rose Mary asked, leaning over her son.</p><p>“Constance Ball attacked us,” Caleb replied.</p><p>“She’s a full-fledged witch, she <span class="italic">and</span> her daughters,” Nathaniel explained. “As Salem sends innocent old women to the gallows, the real witches are left alone.”</p><p>“But why did they attack you?” Rose Mary asked.</p><p>“Because I asked her about Abigail Faulkner. Constance killed her. I just don’t know why.” Nathaniel sat down in a chair near the fire and kicked off his boots.</p><p>Thomas stirred and opened his eyes then sat up with a moan holding his head.</p><p>“I’m sure that woman is up to no good,” Nathaniel continued. “She has a Latin spell book. I think it’s a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.”</span></p><p>“What would she be doing with that?” Hannah asked.</p><p>“I’ve only seen one once. It’s filled with all sorts of ways for binding demons.” Nathaniel indicated his cheek. “The book has many powerful spells. All of them dangerous and all of them evil.”</p><p>“Like what?” Caleb said.</p><p>“Unless I can read it, I have no way of knowing,” Nathaniel said. “But take great care in everything you do now, in town or wherever someone can see you. Constance is up to something and the atmosphere in town is like a dam about to break.”</p><p>“What about the graves?” Caleb asked. “What do those have to do with it?”</p><p>Nathaniel shook his head with frustration. He wasn’t sure what Constance’s plan was, but he knew that it must tie in with Abigail Faulkner’s death, and the unearthed graves.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-three">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean closed Nathaniel’s journal. He was slowly putting it together. Connie and Constance, the old house off Ipswich Road. Could they be one and the same? Could she still be alive, hundreds of years later?</p><p>From the back of the car, he pulled out one of the machetes hidden in the spare tire wheel well and cut down some of the low hanging branches from nearby trees. He piled those on top of the car for cover and then walked back toward the heavily padlocked gate.</p><p>In the distance behind the gate a large brick house loomed tall, surrounded by empty expanses of field on both sides. A high stone wall extended all around the property.</p><p>“Guess I’m not going to be invited in,” Dean said to himself as he hoisted himself onto the flat part of the wall.</p><p>Dean felt something give under his hand. He looked down. Stuck into a crevice in the rock and mortar was a weathered-looking hex bag wrapped in red string—a protection gris-gris bag. He was in the right place.</p><p>Dean jumped down the other side of the wall, feeling the soft earth sink under his shoes. It was going to be difficult to sneak up on the house with all that open space around it. Dean surveyed the area and decided to enter from the back. He snuck around the perimeter of the fields, keeping hidden in the tree line.</p><p>Once he was behind the house, he made his way up the slope and hid behind a barn. From what he could see, five young girls were working on the farm. One was pulling weeds in a what looked like a kitchen garden, another was leading a cow across a pasture. It looked idyllic, if not really old-fashioned.</p><p>Dean heard the titter of voices coming from within the barn and peeked in through the wavy glass panes to see two women grooming a horse.</p><p><span class="italic">This is either going to turn into the hottest Puritan porn I’ve ever seen, or these bitches are witches,</span> he thought.</p><p>He turned his head and—</p><p>WHACKKK!</p><p>He was twisted round and thrown up against the solid wooden surface of the barn. A heavy weight pressed up against his chest, but the brawny field hand in front of him wasn’t even touching him.</p><p>“Hey, sorry, man. Lost my way? Do you give pony rides here?” Dean said.</p><p>The man didn’t answer. Instead, he flicked his wrist and Dean dropped to the ground. Silently, he gestured that Dean should walk toward the house.</p><p>Once inside, Dean was pushed into a chair next to a large stone fireplace. Heavy curtains were drawn across floor-to-ceiling windows; so it was impossible to see outside.</p><p>Moments later a middle-aged woman walked into the room. Dean immediately recognized the woman who had been staring at him in the parking lot. Closer up, Dean could see she had a high-browed forehead and a face set with a wide mouth.</p><p>“Do you often trespass on private property?” she asked in a crackling, accented voice with a slight European lilt to it.</p><p>“Angela Lansbury. Wow, I’m a big fan,” Dean said sarcastically, springing from his seat.</p><p>The big guy in the corner flicked his wrist again and Dean was thrown back into his chair.</p><p>“Don’t worry big guy, I’m not going anywhere. You and I can go out back and milk a cow together. Would you like that?” Dean grinned.</p><p>“What do you want?” the woman asked. She lowered herself into a seat opposite Dean and stared coldly into his eyes.</p><p>“Well, Constance—I’m assuming you’re Constance Hennrick, Connie of Connie’s Curios. Can I call you Connie? Under normal circumstances, Connie, I would cut your throat with a silver knife, chant a little bit then make sure you were buried well and good in four different places. Considering you tried to kill my girlfriend and drown me and her kid, I think that would be letting you off easy,” Dean said. “Though I might have spared a couple of those hotties you have outside if they behaved themselves. It’s hard to find good help these days.”</p><p>“Effective salutation,” Connie said. “Sadly, I’ve lost patience.”</p><p>She got up and gestured to the heavy in the corner.</p><p>“Wait,” Dean said. “About this afternoon, you don’t deny it, so I assume it was you. You have to be pretty powerful to resurrect an entire ship’s worth of pirates.”</p><p>Constance simply shrugged.</p><p>“Then you are exactly the person I’ve been searching for,” Dean said.</p><p>“And why is that?” she said.</p><p>“Because I need your help.”</p><p>“I really don’t have time for little piglets like you.” She gestured again, and the heavy strode over and pulled Dean from his chair.</p><p>“Wait, wait. Listen,” Dean said, “I need a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> I need to raise someone who is caught in a very powerful cage.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t know what to do with a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> if you had one,” she said.</p><p>“No, you’re right. That’s why I need you,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s an impossibility. A book like that has powers beyond your paltry imagination. I am quite sure you don’t have the stomach for it.”</p><p>“So you have one?” Dean persisted.</p><p>“If I did, I wouldn’t let you anywhere near it. Besides, what on earth makes you think I would help you?” she asked.</p><p>“Not a thing. Only that I am pleading with someone that under normal circumstances I would gank in an instant,” Dean replied.</p><p>“Sorry, I don’t work for peasants, much less the likes of <span class="italic">you</span> and <span class="italic">your kind,”</span> Connie said.</p><p>With that she left the room and the brawny guy dragged Dean out of the chair by his collar, pulled him through the house, out of the front door and down the driveway.</p><p>“Hey, Paul Bunyan, lay off the jacket!” Dean said, gasping for breath.</p><p>The guy opened the gate and threw Dean out into the road. He landed on a double yellow line, some twenty feet away from the driveway entrance. It was quite a throw.</p><p>Dean got up and dusted himself off. Things were not going well.</p><p>He limped back to his car, bruised and battered and still a bit damp from his pirate adventure.</p><p>On the passenger seat the case files he had taken from Chief Wiggum had been jostled by the drive, fanning out all the pictures. Dean picked up a particularly brutal photo of a girl in a BU sweatshirt. He was torn. There was a case here.</p><p>All the gris-gris bags in the victims’ cars were certainly the work of witches, probably that of Connie and her girls.</p><p>Dean shook his head at his bad luck. He was just kidding himself. There was no other explanation—Connie had to be the Constance from Nathaniel’s journal. And to make matters worse she was up to something very, very bad. Again.</p><p><span class="italic">It figures that the one person I need help from could have killed ten people.</span> Dean shook it off and decided to go back to the hotel. He should make sure Lisa and Ben were okay.</p><p>Just then two large black Escalades slid out of Connie’s driveway and turned south. Dean’s car was still camouflaged by tree branches so he was pretty sure they didn’t see him. Dean waited until they had disappeared from view, then he turned his car around and followed.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-four">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and his grandfather sat in the parked van on the side of the road hidden around a curve.</p><p>“We’re going to lose them,” Sam said.</p><p>“Just wait,” Samuel responded sternly. They sat silently for a few moments. “Okay, now go. Just hang back a little bit.”</p><p>“Not my first rodeo, gramps,” Sam muttered as he started the vehicle.</p><p>As they made their way into the glowing suburban traffic outside Salem, they watched the two Escalades ahead of them pull into a shopping mall parking lot with Dean’s CRV not far behind. It was about nine p.m. and there were very few cars left in the lot, only a few stragglers, laden with shopping bags, were making their way out of the mall. A large megalith sign, ‘Books ‘n’ Novels,’ clung to the stucco side of the mall. Inside Sam could make out the employees shutting off the lights and locking the doors. The Escalades were parked in the two spaces closest to the bookstore doors.</p><p>Dean parked on the outskirts of the lot, away from the lights. He reached for his flask. The Jack Daniels went down easy and took the edge off the crazy day. Dean wasn’t quite sure why Connie and the girls would need to make a bookstore run at nine at night. Chances were it wasn’t because they were after the next <span class="italic">Twilight</span> novel.</p><p>Sam and Samuel waited in the white van on the other side of the lot, far away from the store.</p><p>“What do you think they’re doing?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No idea, but I don’t think it’s to pick up Ad Hoc,” his grandfather replied.</p><p>Sam raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Thomas Keller’s new... Forget it. I’m a fan is all,” Samuel said.</p><p>“You’re a fan of celebrity chefs?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Do you know how hard it is to get a restaurant up and running?” Samuel asked with sincerity. “He’s a genius.”</p><p>The last bank of lights in the store was shut off. Dean watched as a mousy-looking girl emerged from the double glass doors holding a large key ring. She shoved the key in the lock and fiddled with it, twisting and turning it in an increasingly desperate attempt to lock up the store.</p><p>A figure slipped out of the back door of one of the Escalades and approached her. Dean perked up as he clocked the gorgeous blonde girl in boots and a short jean skirt.</p><p>“Need some help?” she asked the mouse, who was beginning to visibly panic. The parking lot was silent as a grave. When he wound down his window, Dean was just about able to hear the exchange.</p><p>“No, thanks,” the other girl replied, without looking up. “It’s just these stupid keys. My manager needed to leave early and—“</p><p>In an instant the blonde elbowed her in the face. A look of surprise and hurt washed over the mousey girl’s features, and a line of blood dribbled out the corner of her mouth. She tried to raise her hand in a futile attempt to block another parry, but she was far too slow. The other girl punched her in the stomach. She dropped the keys and doubled over, then stumbled, losing her balance. Her assailant was behind her in an instant, effortlessly catching her by the underarms.</p><p>Several other girls all dressed in dark hoodies jumped out of the Escalades and circled around the glass doors. Dean recognized them from Connie’s farm; he counted seven of them in total.</p><p>One of them retrieved the keys from the ground and pushed open the door, then the entire group walked into the store, the first girl dragging the passed-out employee. The girl with the keys expertly pried open the face of the burglar alarm and neatly disarmed it.</p><p>A few moments later, Connie herself slipped out of one of the cars and slid across the parking lot and into the bookstore.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Back in the van Samuel and Sam waited.</p><p>“We can’t go in if Dean’s here,” Samuel said. His voice tinged with frustration.</p><p>“Well, if they’re witches let’s catch them in the act. Either we will or Dean will.”</p><p>“They’re most likely going to hurt that girl,” Samuel pointed out.</p><p>“So how are they doing it, do you think?” Sam asked. “If they’re creating monsters they have to be using some sort of power for the spells, right? They must be using human sacrifices. Only way to really get a lot of juice for a spell big enough to change people into monsters.”</p><p>Samuel closed his mouth. There were no monsters, he just had to keep up the ruse to trick Sam into believing they were in Salem for a reason other than to make sure Dean didn’t try to raise Lucifer with a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> Maybe he had taken the lie too far.</p><p>It seemed to him that since he had arrived back on Earth, he found himself doing things he never would have done before Mary’s death. Like being in business with a demon—the “King of Hell” no less. Samuel slowly shook his head. Where had his moral compass disappeared to?</p><p>They watched through the giant glass windows of the bookstore as the group headed toward the central area and started moving entire sections of books, apparently clearing out a space.</p><p>“Come on, Dean. Make a move,” Samuel murmured under his breath.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Inside his car Dean was furiously loading his sawed-off with real bullets—those girls weren’t ghosts, that was for sure. He was going to need real firepower.</p><p>From the glove compartment, he pulled out a ski mask. The good thing about Lisa was that she packed for every eventuality; even if it was the middle of summer she brought winter clothing just in case they got caught in a blizzard.</p><p>Dean pulled the ski mask over his head. Connie was inside and Dean didn’t want to get ID’d by her—after all he still might have to use her.</p><p>Dean considered how to approach the store. Since the entire facade was plate-glass windows, he might have to create a distraction first. He zipped open a pocket on his duffle bag and pulled out four small blocks of C4.</p><p>“Bobby, you’re a life saver,” he said to himself.</p><p>Bobby has a near limitless of suppliers that could get them just about anything, even highly illegal C4.</p><p>Dean pushed a series of wires into the clay-like blocks. He got out of the car and pulled Ben’s skateboard from the back seat. He then crept along the side of the building.</p><p>At the front corner he put the skateboard down, got down on his stomach and glided past the windows, low enough to remain unseen by occupants of the building. As he steered himself past the windows, Dean pushed the blocks of C4 against the glass, until every twenty feet of window had a charge attached to it. Dean then grasped his duffle and ran around the side of the building.</p><p>Halfway down the long side of the building a ladder ran up the wall to the roof. Dean clambered onto a nearby dumpster and, leaning precariously, managed to catch the bottom rung. He hoisted himself onto the ladder, scrambled up and then made his way cautiously across the roof.</p><p>Inside, Connie’s girls were clearly doing some construction of their own; a large rumbling echoed from below. Dean unscrewed an air-conditioning vent and climbed in. He could hear several voices chanting in Latin from inside the store. Crawling through the ducts, he tried to get closer to the source of the chanting.</p><p>Dean approximated that he was in the middle of the store, when he saw light filtering through a large square vent. He peeked through the slats and counted seven young girls and Connie standing in a circle. In the center, the Books ‘n’ Novels employee knelt, whimpering.</p><p>“Please, I’ll do anything. I’ll empty all the registers. I know the code to the safe in back—I dated one of the day managers.” Tears streamed down her cheeks, but her pleas were ignored as the girls continued to chant.</p><p>Dean focused his gaze on Connie. In her hands she held a small, ancient-looking book.</p><p>The <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>He froze. Could it be the one mentioned in Nathaniel’s diary?</p><p>Connie stepped forward into the circle. She held up a long silver knife and approached the blubbering captive.</p><p>“Finally, sisters, the time has come when we can raise him,” she began, her voice cold and clear. “He will be our husband and our leader. Lift up your voices to him.” Connie started to speak in Latin.</p><p>Dean slipped the small remote out of his coat pocket.</p><p>“Sorry Connie, your body count is going to stop here,” Dean murmured. He pressed the button.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>He tried again.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p><span class="italic">I’m too far in the duct for it to work. There’s too much interference,</span> Dean realized. <span class="italic">Crap.</span></p><p>Connie held the knife over the girl as the chant continued.</p><p>Dean frantically pressed the button over and over. Still nothing. He was left with only one option.</p><p>He turned around awkwardly in the tight space, and with all his weight stomped onto the duct cover. The chanting stopped abruptly. Dean continued to bash his foot against the air-conditioning cover.</p><p>He heard Connie’s powerful voice echo through the store.</p><p>“You’re not going to stop me, Campbell.”</p><p>There was a crash as Dean finally broke through the vent cover, he reached his upper body into the store, holding onto the edge of the vent with one hand.</p><p>Connie flicked her hand and Dean watched horror-stricken as the employee’s head spun around 180 degrees. The girl’s eyes grew wide, then lifeless. Connie caught her with one hand by the nape of her floppy neck. With the other she sliced the blade across her throat. Blood dribbled out onto the floor, pooling over the linoleum and the industrial-grade beige rug.</p><p>The girls began chanting again.</p><p>Reaching his arm as far as he could into the store, Dean pressed the button on the remote.</p><p>Almost immediately, percussive explosions ripped through the building. Shattered glass blew everywhere. Books flew off the shelves and shredded magazines confettied everyone inside.</p><p>Dean hung from the ceiling and having replaced the remote with his sawed-off shotgun started firing. The girls took cover behind the bookshelves, but Connie remained where she was and continued chanting. Each bullet Dean fired at her ricocheted away—she had a seriously heavy duty protection spell on her.</p><p>Right beneath Dean the linoleum floor started to fracture, then heave upwards as if it was taking deep breaths. Great chunks lifted up then toppled over. The exposed earth underneath fell away, and a pair of grimy hands broke through the soil, pushing away the rocks and stone.</p><p>Connie’s chanting had ceased. She looked up at Dean. With a flick of her hand he was pulled out of the vent and thrown against the back wall.</p><p>“Out of my way, worm,” she hissed.</p><p>Connie then knelt down and gently pulled a figure out of the ground. Dust and dirt fell off of the body, like a mummy coming to life, and the figure twitched and creaked from hundreds of years of confinement. The girls gathered round in deference.</p><p><span class="italic">Must be a long buried witch,</span> Dean realized. <span class="italic">So that’s what she’s up to, sacrificing young girls to resurrect her long-dead buddies. Nice.</span></p><p>Out on the highway, Dean heard sirens scream. The girls deftly picked up the earth-encrusted figure and moved rapidly out of the store.</p><p>Dean abruptly fell from the wall down onto the maternity section. He pulled himself out of a crushed shelf display of books on breast-feeding. He limped to the front of the store and out of a gap where one of the windows had been.</p><p><span class="italic">So much for creating a diversion.</span></p><p>The Escalades were long gone. He got in his car and peeled out of the parking lot just as a long line of emergency vehicles popped over the curbs and surrounded the store.</p><p>Sam and Samuel pulled the van away.</p><p>“Guess we know what they’re doing now: resurrecting people. Didn’t look like a monster to me though,” Sam said, weaving in and out of traffic.</p><p>“I could be wrong,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Or you could be lying,” his grandson said angrily.</p><p>Suddenly he pulled the emergency brake and skidded to a stop on the side of the busy highway.</p><p>“What the hell is going on, Samuel? I trusted you! I don’t think we’re here because those witches are creating monsters. So either you bring me up to speed or I am more than happy to leave you here. You’d make a great Red Sox fan, since they always seem to lose lately. And this certainly is a losing game. <span class="italic">Tell me what’s going on.”</span> Sam stared at his grandfather.</p><p>Samuel shrugged his shoulders, recognizing that he was beaten.</p><p>“Dean is trying to get his hands on a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,”</span> he admitted.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’m assuming so he can raise you from the dead. Get you out of Hell.”</p><p>“Dean shouldn’t put himself in so much danger,” Sam said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“It would be bad if Dean tried to raise Lucifer mistakenly. But this is a case,” Sam said. “Those witches are up to something. You don’t start resurrecting old friends for the hell of it. “</p><p>Samuel shook his head, he couldn’t tell Sam about his deal with Crowley. He needed to make sure Dean didn’t raise Lucifer. <span class="italic">Such a stupid boy,</span> thought Samuel. He couldn’t leave Sam to watch Dean and go on this wild goose chase with witches. Whatever they were up to.</p><p>“Sam, I have things to do. I have to get back to herding Alphas. You know that,” Samuel said. “And I need your help.”</p><p>“Sorry Samuel. Innocent people are getting killed. This is a case. You can go back. But I’m staying.”</p><p>Samuel nodded. “Okay, fine.”</p><p>Sam leaned over Samuel and opened the passenger door.</p><p>“I’ll see you later.”</p><p>Samuel stared incredulously at his grandson.</p><p>“You want me to get out here?”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>“I want to follow Dean. He’s on that old witch’s tail. I don’t want to lose him.”</p><p>Samuel got out of the van. A light drizzle twinkled in the headlights of the few cars on the road at this hour.</p><p>Sam nodded, pulled the door closed, then continued to follow his brother.</p><p>Dean snuck into the hotel room just past midnight. Lisa was asleep on the bed, but as soon as Dean sat down to take off his shoes, she stirred.</p><p>“What’s that smell?” she asked.</p><p>“Cordite,” Dean said.</p><p>Lisa sat up and peered at Dean.</p><p>“Why were you firing a gun?”</p><p>“Shooting practice,” Dean said, lying down on the bed beside her. “You still mad at me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Lisa answered.</p><p>“Okay. Can we talk about it in the morning?” Dean asked.</p><p>Lisa nodded and turned her back on Dean. He shrugged; that was as good as he was going to get tonight.</p><p>He tried to close his eyes but exhausted as his body was, sleep wasn’t on the cards. He had set out to find someone to help him to raise his brother, and he had. It just hadn’t turned out like he thought it would. He had found a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> and he had found a powerful witch who could use it. Everything would be perfect if it weren’t for the fact that she was killing young girls, and bringing old witches back from the dead.</p><p>Once again he opened up Nathaniel’s journal.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-five">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A couple of weeks later all of Salem Village was in a frenzy. Tituba, Reverend Parris’s servant, had admitted to practicing witchcraft. She said that four figures had come to her in her sleep and told her to “sign a book” to swear allegiance to Satan. The magistrates, now four men, insisted on knowing the names of the people who had forced Tituba to hurt the girls.</p><p>More names were called and more innocent people were brought before the magistrates and accused of witchcraft. As each accused person was brought into the meetinghouse, the afflicted girls would scream and writhe in pain.</p><p>Nathaniel, Hannah, Caleb, and Thomas watched the proceedings from the back of the meetinghouse. As each day passed the theatrics of the court worried Nathaniel more and more. The town was clearly being whipped into a frenzy over witches. But since Constance and her daughters were absent from the proceedings, the question remained as to who in the court was a real witch.</p><p>From his position at the back of the room, Nathaniel had a clear view of Prudence Lewis. Day after day she stood closest to the accused, always in the same place, with the rest of the girls lined up to her right. After watching her carefully for many hours on end, Nathaniel noted that it seemed whenever the girls went into a fit, Prudence Lewis was the one they all followed. If Prudence started to scream, they all started to scream. This happened time and time again as more and more accused witches were brought in.</p><p>Nathaniel could not believe that the people being accused were all witches. One woman in particular, Martha Cory, he knew to be a pious woman who attended church every Sunday as well as Thursday scripture services. She could not be a witch.</p><p>But what was at work? It seemed as if the afflicted girls were being harassed in some way. But by what? Scrapes and scars showed up on their faces and wrists. If they weren’t doing it themselves, someone or something must be doing it to them. This behavior, coupled with the strange encounter Caleb and Thomas had had with Prudence Lewis in the cellar, made Nathaniel suspect that Prudence was somehow influencing the other girls.</p><p>“Boys, I want you to follow Prudence Lewis,” Nathaniel said. “I want to know where she goes tonight, when and with whom.”</p><p>Caleb and Thomas nodded.</p><p>That afternoon, as the winter sunlight waned and most of Salem trudged home through the snow, Caleb and Thomas waited for Prudence to leave the meetinghouse. She emerged escorted by Reverend Parris and John Hathorne and together they walked to Parris’s home. Once there, the men went inside but Prudence remained outside.</p><p>After a few moments she stepped out onto the road, and peered both ways as though to check for spies. The boys crouched behind a hedge on the other side of the road, and held their breath.</p><p>Apparently satisfied that she was alone, Prudence started walking up the road away from the village, before taking a sharp right to cut across a field. Caleb and Thomas followed a good distance behind her. They could barely see her figure in the waning light as she disappeared into the tree line.</p><p>“Is she going toward Constance Ball’s?” Caleb whispered. His shoes crunched on the firm snow as he followed in his brother’s footsteps.</p><p>“Looks like it,” Thomas replied.</p><p>“Should we tell Father?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Let’s see what happens first,” his brother said.</p><p>When Thomas turned back around he suddenly stopped in his tracks. Prudence was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Where did she go?”</p><p>“She was right there,” Caleb said.</p><p>They squinted at the tree line fifty yards in front of them. Prudence had definitely disappeared. The brothers looked at each other—this wasn’t what was supposed to happen. They started walking again, still keeping quiet. Thomas drew out a silver blade from his jacket. Caleb took out a wooden bat. They hadn’t any shotguns with them.</p><p>“Don’t make a sound,” Thomas murmured.</p><p>“I’m trying not to. You don’t make a sound,” Caleb hissed back.</p><p>They crept into the woods at the very spot where they had last seen Prudence. On the ground there was a circle of small footsteps, but they didn’t lead in any direction, they just stopped as if someone had scooped her up off the ground. Thomas and Caleb peered into the dark canopy above them. Shadowy, sinewy trees poked upward, their frozen branches creaking in the wind.</p><p>“Does she fly?” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Shush,” Thomas said. His blade at the ready. “She has to be around here somewhere.”</p><p>“Thoma—“ Caleb screamed.</p><p>Thomas spun around to find Caleb five feet in the air, pinned up against a tree. Prudence Lewis stood three feet away. An unseen force held Caleb up. His eyes bulged in fear.</p><p>“Thomas, I can’t breathe,” Caleb croaked.</p><p>“Let my brother down,” Thomas commanded.</p><p>“Aw, if it isn’t the Campbell boys. Did your daddy tell you to follow me?” Prudence hissed.</p><p>“Let Caleb down and maybe I won’t kill you!” Thomas threatened.</p><p>“Oh please, you can’t kill me. I’m so much more powerful than you silly boys can imagine,” Prudence said. “Not only can I do this,” she flicked her wrist and Caleb’s ears started to bleed, “but right now it seems like I can get anyone in Salem to believe anything I say!”</p><p>“You’re the one afflicting the girls,” Thomas declared. “None of those people are witches. You are!”</p><p>“Maybe, maybe not.”</p><p>“Why are you sending innocent people to jail?” Thomas demanded.</p><p>“If I tell you that I might have to kill you. Though, I might kill you anyway,” she said with a smile.</p><p>Thomas lunged at her with his knife.</p><p>Prudence took an enormous leap and landed on a low tree branch fifteen feet behind him. The distance gave Thomas ample room to run to Caleb. He jumped and hung onto Caleb’s feet, but his brother didn’t budge, and he was quickly turning blue.</p><p>“Let him down! Or I swear to God I will burn down this entire forest with you in it.”</p><p>“I’d like to see you try!” Prudence taunted.</p><p>Thomas pulled a couple of bags of herbs from his coat. He spread them on the ground and started chanting in Latin.</p><p><span class="italic">“Ego vocamus upon bonitas of life, ad concertamus tergus hic malum. Imus circa me conditi annulus of ardor. Imus circa me loco custodia.”</span> A small flame of fire sprang up in Thomas’s hand, which he threw at the base of the tree. The fire quickly spread to form a ring around the tree and the two boys.</p><p>Prudence dropped elegantly back on the ground, standing outside the ring of fire.</p><p>“Looks like you’re stuck,” she observed maliciously.</p><p>“Or you are,” Thomas said. He chanted a little more Latin. The fire rose and crackled, until it reached eight feet high. Then Thomas gave one last command in Latin.</p><p>The fire exploded over the woods. Prudence covered her face as the percussion threw her onto her back twenty feet away. Caleb dropped to the ground and Thomas ran to his brother’s side. As quickly as it had started, the fire died down to embers around them.</p><p>“How did you do that?” Prudence demanded. “You’re not a witch!”</p><p>“No, but we are not without our own tricks,” Thomas replied.</p><p>Thomas pulled Caleb up from the ground and turned back to Prudence.</p><p>“I know what you are, and you’re not going to get away with tricking the entire town into thinking those people are witches.”</p><p>“Oh really? And what are you going to do about it, Thomas Campbell? Tell your father? Tell the magistrates? I have them wrapped around my finger like a string. I’ll make sure that they know what you are.” Prudence turned on her heel and in an instant was gone.</p><p>Thomas grabbed Caleb’s shoulder and the brothers retreated back across the frozen field toward home.</p><p>“Well, one thing’s for sure,” Caleb said.</p><p>“What?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“Prudence is definitely not as pretty as she used to be.” Caleb smirked.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-six">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean woke up at gone nine a.m, alone. He pulled himself out of bed and headed downstairs, hoping to grab a cup of coffee. Lisa was sitting at a table drinking hers, and when she looked up as he walked in, a little scowl crossed her face. Clearly, she still wasn’t happy with Dean about yesterday. The fact that he had come home past midnight probably hadn’t helped.</p><p>Dean pulled up a chair and sat down across the table from her. He fingered the lace tablecloth. He anticipated that Lisa was going to go after him, but didn’t want to be the one to speak first. This obviously wasn’t turning out to be the vacation Lisa had hoped for.</p><p>He took a deep breath; someone had to break the stalemate.</p><p>“So. I thought we could go to the beach today,” Dean began cautiously.</p><p>Lisa raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Haven’t you had enough of the water? Any second I’m expecting the police to come through the door and arrest you for causing millions of dollars of damage.”</p><p>“That wasn’t specifically my fault,” Dean countered. “Anyway, you don’t have to worry about the police, I had Ingrid change our name in the registry.”</p><p>Lisa shook her head.</p><p>“You just think of everything don’t you?”</p><p>Dean had to admit that he did.</p><p>“Where’s Ben?” he asked.</p><p>“Perry came to pick him up. I think they went sightseeing and then to watch a movie,” Lisa said.</p><p>Dean furrowed his brow.</p><p>“To a movie or to watch a movie?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. She’s a nice girl, Dean,” Lisa said. “I’ve spent more time with her than I have with you in the past couple of days. I’m thinking about taking her home instead of you.”</p><p>“But you don’t know anything about her,” Dean objected.</p><p>“So? She’s a girl, Dean. A regular girl. Not everything is a conspiracy.”</p><p>“Lisa, I’m not some wack-a-doodle who thinks we didn’t go to the moon. Though I still would like to know why we haven’t gone back.” Dean shook his head, he was getting off topic. “The point is, I’ve seen things and there are monsters everywhere. Do you know what’s <span class="italic">really</span> hiding in the sewers of New York? You don’t want to know.</p><p>“But I would like to get to know the girl a little more before sending Ben off on his own with her.”</p><p>Lisa got up from the table.</p><p>“He’s <span class="italic">my</span> son and if I think it’s okay for him to go see a movie with a girl, then it’s okay.”</p><p>Dean threw up his hands. He hated this “blended family” shit. At least with his father you always knew whose word to go by.</p><p>Dean followed Lisa out of the dining room and through the lobby area of the inn. Ingrid stood in her regular gnomish way behind the registration counter.</p><p>“Mr. and Mrs. Winchester!” she called. “Oh sorry. I meant Mr. and Mrs. Newsted. Would you like to schedule that ghost tour now? It’s ten percent off for all guests.”</p><p>“Ingrid, I hate to break it to you, but you don’t have any ghosts,” Dean said.</p><p>Ingrid gasped.</p><p>“Look,” Dean said pulling out his EMF meter. “See, nothing. No ghosts. If there were ghosts in this place believe me, I would know.”</p><p>A touristy-looking couple in Bermuda shorts and T-shirts printed with “I believe in ghosts” stared at Dean. They looked crushed.</p><p>Dean turned around.</p><p>“Sorry. Just couldn’t keep my mouth shut any longer.”</p><p>Lisa apologized to a despondent Ingrid and dragged Dean out of the inn and onto the brick sidewalk.</p><p>“Really? You had to do that didn’t you?” Lisa looked at him, incredulous.</p><p>“Lisa, I really don’t want to get into a fight about this. Where is Ben? I’m going to go pick him up.”</p><p>“There’s no talking sense into you,” Lisa said, taking out her phone. “You can call him and ask.”</p><p>“You don’t even know where he is?”</p><p>“He’s with Perry, Dean. Get over it.”</p><p>Dean pointed to her phone.</p><p>“Get him on the phone, now.”</p><p>“Why are you doing this, Dean? What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>Dean pursed his lips. For a moment, he thought about blurting it all out, the <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> the witches, the horrible murders. But he imagined her terrified face and just couldn’t do it. The truth hurts and Lisa was the last person he wanted to cause any pain.</p><p>“Can you just trust me?” he said gently.</p><p>“We aren’t here <span class="italic">just</span> for a vacation, are we Dean? Is Ben in some kind of trouble?” Lisa persisted.</p><p>“I don’t know that he’s in trouble. I’m just playing it safe. I want us three to spend time together and I would rather he not discover <span class="italic">Love Story, Part Two: The Salem Years.</span> Just call him. Please.”</p><p>Lisa pressed some buttons on her phone, then put it to her ear. After a few moments, she spoke into it.</p><p>“Ben, it’s Mom. You’re supposed to always keep your phone on, we talked about this. Call me as soon as you get this. Dean and I are going to come pick you up.” Lisa hung up and looked back at Dean. “Should I be worried?”</p><p>“No, he’s just watching a movie with a strange girl in a strange town with some very strange things going on in it.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“It means that, yes, there is something happening in this town. But I swear I didn’t know about it until we got here,” Dean said. It was, strictly, the truth.</p><p>“I knew it. Why couldn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>“Now what are you doing?”</p><p>Dean had opened the car, which he had parked in front of the inn. He had pulled out his laptop and was furiously hacking into Lisa’s cell phone site.</p><p>“Wait a minute, how do you know my password?” Lisa asked, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>“You have a GPS on the phone right?” Dean said. “I’m just activating it so we can see where he is.”</p><p>“You still haven’t answered my question: How do you know my password?”</p><p>“Lisa, please. Favorite Show: <span class="italic">Gilmore Girls.</span> Town you grew up in: Cicero. Name of first pet: Snowball.”</p><p>“When did I tell you about my guinea pig?” Lisa asked.</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Hello! First date. I learned many things. Including how bendy you are,” Dean said with a smirk.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re breaking into my private account and trying to charm me at the same time.”</p><p>“Please, it’s not the first time,” Dean said. “Okay, got it.” He brought up the tracking map of Ben’s cell phone. The little blip said he was somewhere on a street called Harpers Circle.</p><p>“Where is that? Is it far?” Lisa asked. “They were supposed to go to the <span class="italic">movie theater.”</span></p><p>“No, you assumed seeing a movie meant going to a movie theater. You can’t assume that with boys. Believe me, I know,” Dean said as he put the address into his phone. “Let’s go and get him, before this becomes a Thora Birch Lifetime movie.”</p><p>Lisa looked at him as they climbed into the car.</p><p>“You know, some of your pop culture references are seriously obscure.”</p><p>Dean nodded. He did know that. They pulled out into traffic. Dean was really hoping he was overreacting and everything was fine, but he had learned a long time ago that you can’t be too careful in a town when things are going ass-over-elbows.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-seven">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Following the GPS, Dean and Lisa drove out of town and onto a double-lane freeway. A short while later, they turned onto a side street. Even though it was mid-morning, the streetlights were slowly flickering in response to a bank of dark clouds pushing in from the shore.</p><p>The road swung around in a large circle. On one side a deep thicket of trees ran along the edge; on the other a series of modern apartment buildings were set at different angles around the grounds. Suddenly, the landscape opened up, revealing a long brick building topped with spires and gothic-looking windows, that stood in stark contrast to the modern buildings that surrounded it.</p><p>Dean surveyed the scene. He had omitted to tell Lisa what else he had found out during his brief foray on the Internet. This wasn’t some ideal planned community that had popped up out of nowhere. The complex had been built on the grounds of the old state insane asylum.</p><p>They parked the car at the leasing office and walked in. Behind the counter a kid, who looked scarcely older than Ben, was sitting watching a baseball game on his computer.</p><p>“Are the Sox up?” Dean asked the kid, who hadn’t even glanced up as they walked in.</p><p>“Bottom of the eighth. Two runners on. Ortiz is up.”</p><p>“Great. Can you tell me what apartment Perry—“ Dean looked at Lisa. “What’s her last name?”</p><p>Lisa shook her head.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Can you just look up Perry, then?” Dean said to the kid.</p><p>The kid had finally peeled his eyes away from the screen. He was regarding Dean doubtfully. “No can do, bro. I can’t give out residents’ apartment numbers.”</p><p>Dean took a twenty from his wallet.</p><p>“How about now?”</p><p>The kid eyed the money.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, I’d have to get some sort of—“</p><p>Another twenty joined the first.</p><p>The kid smiled, clearly he was going to try to milk this for all it was worth.</p><p>“It really puts my job on the line, man.”</p><p>Unfortunately for the kid, he had overplayed his hand. With one arm Dean pushed the kid away from the desk, with the other he spun the computer screen around.</p><p>“Hey, you can’t do that. That’s private property,” the kid whined.</p><p>“Well, now it’s public,” Dean said, typing a search for Perry’s name into the computer. He drummed his fingers impatiently as the computer creaked into action. Finally it produced an answer: “Kirkbride Building, apartment twelve,” he read.</p><p>Dean swiped back his twenties and Lisa and he left. Dean swung the car back around and they parked in front of the large brick building.</p><p>“Well, at least this is nice,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Yeah, about that...” Dean pulled a pair of sawed-offs out from under his seat.</p><p>“What the hell are those for?” Lisa squealed.</p><p>“Relax, mine has real bullets, yours has salt. You might have the advantage here,” he said.</p><p>“I thought you said there was nothing to worry about?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “There isn’t. Prophylactic measure. No pun intended.”</p><p>Lisa rolled her eyes. They walked up to the entrance and rang the buzzer to Perry’s apartment. After about thirty seconds with no response, Dean began to methodically ring each of the apartment buzzers in turn. Eventually someone carelessly buzzed them in.</p><p>Apartment twelve was on the first floor. Noise filtered from each of the doors as they passed. At apartment twelve Dean knocked on the door and gestured for Lisa to talk.</p><p>“Ben? Ben Braeden? You come out here this instant,” Lisa called.</p><p>“Could you sound like more of a mom?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You try it, smart ass,” she countered.</p><p>“Fine. Give me your phone.” Dean took the phone from her and called Ben’s number. From inside the apartment they heard his phone ring. “Okay, so we know he’s in there or was there and someone hit ‘ignore’ when you called before.”</p><p>“He knows not to do that,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Maybe it wasn’t him. Hold on,” Dean said. He took his lock pick from his jacket pocket and fiddled with the lock. Seconds later, it clicked open. He turned to Lisa with a serious look in his eye. “Okay, so no matter what we find in here you’re going to stay calm, right?”</p><p>“I don’t like the sound of that. What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>“Probably no need to worry, but this building was an insane asylum up until 1992, and in my experience, not always, but usually there are some very angry, delusional ghosts in places like these.”</p><p>“That’s crazy, Dean. It’s an apartment building now.”</p><p>“Just follow my lead,” Dean said, opening the door and walking into the apartment with his sawed-off at the ready. “Perry? Ben? Time to go home.” They moved through the apartment, checking each room in turn but the place was clearly empty. Lisa retrieved Ben’s phone from the living room sofa.</p><p>“Is that definitely his?” Dean asked.</p><p>Lisa nodded.</p><p>Dean peaked around a corner into what looked like a young girl’s bedroom. A feeling of relief washed over him when he saw that the bed was neatly made.</p><p>When he opened the doors of the built-in closet the uneasy feeling returned. Set into the plaster wall at the back was an old oak door.</p><p>“Wasn’t quite the walk-in closet I was expecting,” Dean said.</p><p>Lisa looked over his shoulder.</p><p>“That’s strange.”</p><p>“Okay, so here’s the deal: I go first. You don’t shoot unless I tell you to. Clear?”</p><p>“Who are we shooting at? Is Ben in there?” Lisa sounded panicky.</p><p>Dean pulled open the door. A musty blast of cool air hit them as they descended a steep spiral staircase.</p><p>“Somehow I don’t think this is on the rental brochure,” Dean said.</p><p>At the bottom of the staircase was a vaulted hallway which disappeared into gloom in both directions.</p><p>“These must have been used by the doctors and nurses to go between the buildings in the winter,” Dean explained.</p><p>“They couldn’t have made it a little more cozy?” Lisa said, shivering in her T-shirt.</p><p>Dean walked first into the pitch black of the tunnel. A cold chill ran through him. He took out the EMF again—the needle pinged to the max.</p><p>“That’s not good,” he said.</p><p>“What? What isn’t good?’ Lisa rushed forward to Dean, but something stopped her. “Ah, Dean?”</p><p>Dean glanced in her direction, then quickly pulled her behind him. He lifted the salt-filled shotgun out of her hands and pointed it into the darkness behind them.</p><p>BLAMMM! The gunshot echoed through the tunnels.</p><p>Out of the gloom a figure appeared. It was the ghost of an old woman in a stained robe. She continued to advance on them.</p><p>“Time for your treatment,” she wailed.</p><p>Dean shot at her again. But the specter quickly flicked to standing six inches away from Dean’s face. He backed against the wall with Lisa still behind him.</p><p>“No exceptions! Every day!” The ghost howled and held her head.</p><p>“Move,” Dean hissed urgently.</p><p>But it was too late. The ghost shot her hand out, hitting Dean square in the chest. Both guns fell from his hands and he clutched at the collar of his T-shirt, dropping to his knees.</p><p>“Can’t... can’t breathe,” he choked. His heart was quickly becoming solid, freezing over.</p><p>“Shoot her!” Dean gasped.</p><p>Lisa reached for the salt-filled sawed-off and fumbled as she tried to aim it at the ghost.</p><p>“Now, please,” Dean croaked as his lips quickly turned blue.</p><p>Lisa pulled off a shot. The bullet hit the ghost, dissipating her in an instant.</p><p>“I got her!” she said proudly.</p><p>“Only for a second,” Dean said getting off his knees and rubbing his chest. He took a canister of salt from his jacket and poured a line across the tunnel. “Let’s go.” Dean grabbed Lisa’s hand and pulled her down the tunnel.</p><p>“Ben! Ben! Where are you?” Lisa called.</p><p>Two more disgruntled ghosts of mental patients swarmed at them. Dean quickly let off a couple of shots, then poured another salt barrier.</p><p>“Mom!” Ben’s small voice echoed faintly through the tunnel.</p><p>“Ben?” Lisa called, running forward into the darkness.</p><p>Dean yanked free an iron rod that was serving as a railing on the wall. He used it to obliterate each ghost they encountered as they moved quickly forward. Further down the tunnel the low ceilings opened up into a kind of catacomb. Light seeped out from underneath an iron door. Ben called from the other side.</p><p>“Hold on, Ben. We’re here,” Dean responded.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’ve come to join us,” a voice said.</p><p>Lisa and Dean turned. A decidedly older-looking Perry stood behind them. Far from fifteen, she now looked like she was in her early twenties.</p><p>“What concerned parents you are,” she mused. “I find it touching. Really, I do. You don’t see that much these days, what with all the divorce. But you two seem to really make it work.” Perry sauntered up to Dean. She was inches away from his face. “Oh, but wait, Ben isn’t your child, is he Dean? But yet, here you are. Still attached. That’s okay though. I don’t mind. I was hoping I could be your baby mama, as they say these days.” Perry laughed.</p><p>“In this light you look a little older, Perry. So what are you pushing,” Dean spat at her, “one hundred? Two hundred?”</p><p>She eyed him. “If we’re going to have a child together, I might as well be honest. Let’s say somewhere around three hundred-eighteen. But age doesn’t matter when you have a lust like ours. Right, Dean?” Perry pawed at Dean’s chest.</p><p>“Lay off, you old slut,” Lisa growled.</p><p>“Oh look, mama grizzly made an appearance. Let me tell you something,” Perry turned toward Lisa, “a boy like Ben... Well, you really should be more careful. You wouldn’t want him ending up on Dateline.”</p><p>Lisa pulled back and punched Perry in the mouth. A line of blood trickled from her nose. Perry eyed her with shock.</p><p>“You have more spunk than I thought.”</p><p>“And you have a little mark,” Lisa said indicating Perry’s nose.</p><p>“Bitch!” Perry flung her arm aside and Lisa flew across the hallway. She collapsed to the ground, out cold.</p><p>Dean faced down Perry.</p><p>“So what’s the endgame here, Perry? You part of the killings?”</p><p>“You think I have to answer to you? You have no idea how long we’ve waited for this exact moment in time. It’s all happening, and let me tell you, none of us are going to let you stand in our way.” Perry advanced on Dean.</p><p>Dean swung the iron rod. Perry stopped it easily with one hand. Dean swung his gun around and aimed it at her, but she knocked the gun away with merely a finger. Dean was empty handed.</p><p>Perry shot out her arm and caught Dean by the collar, and then spun around and threw him against the wall. Dean crumpled to the floor, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>“You should know that being this old has a lot of advantages. If you’re really nice, I’ll let you in on the little magic secret. Forget all those animals that you hunt—vampires and all. Disgusting. Witchcraft is the real power. Who knew that a little spell and fifty human sacrifices could bring you immortality? But here I am. Living proof.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t call what you are ‘living’,” Dean said.</p><p>“Of course you would. And it’s something that’s bothered you from the get-go. Dean, you know you have a code of ethics. Are you really going to kill me? After all, I’m human. You don’t want to kill a human. I’m not a monster, after all.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that,” Dean said, as he leapt for the iron rod on the floor and swung it at her.</p><p>“Tsk. This is grounds for some serious relationship counseling.” Perry grabbed Dean by the throat and pushed him into a corner. “I think we should start this romance on the right foot, don’t you, honey?” Perry swiped the iron rod from Dean and bashed it down on his left foot.</p><p>Dean howled in pain.</p><p>“There we go. Now I know you can’t run. Just stay here for a little while. I want to get to know my new stepson better.”</p><p>Perry flicked her hand and Dean’s wrists magically bound together. She then disappeared into the room beyond the oak door. For an instant Dean caught a glimpse of Ben tied to an old electrical shock chair, then the door slammed shut. Dean struggled against his invisible bonds.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lisa stirred. She slowly opened her eyes and saw Dean on the opposite side of the hallway near the door. Her head ached</p><p>“Dean? Dean, where’s Ben?” she said.</p><p>Dean shushed her. She watched him squirm on the floor. He was trying to empty out his pockets with his hands bound behind his back by an invisible force. A couple of packets of herbs fell out of his jacket. He kicked off a boot and with his big toe drew a series of sigils on the dirt-covered floor. He chanted a couple of words in Latin, then awkwardly flung his lit Zippo into the center of the circle. The herbs caught fire. Dean pulled his hands apart.</p><p>“Nothing like a little white magic to counteract the black,” he murmured.</p><p>He got up and gently pulled Lisa to her feet.</p><p>“Are you okay?” he asked.</p><p>She nodded and rubbed her head where she had hit the wall.</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>Dean handed her the gun with the bullets.</p><p>“You’re going to need this,” he said.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can shoot her,” Lisa said nervously.</p><p>“You’re going to feel differently in a second,” Dean replied ominously.</p><p>He swiftly loaded the other gun with real shotgun shells, then kicked open the oak door.</p><p>Inside, Ben was strapped to an electroshock chair in a dark, tiled room that must have been used for electroshock therapy. He looked scared but otherwise unharmed.</p><p>Perry sat nearby on a Victorian-era stretcher.</p><p>“Mummy and Daddy come to take their little boy home? I don’t think so,” she said.</p><p>She jumped off the stretcher and with a flick of her wrist the gurney flew across the room. Dean pulled Lisa to the ground, the speeding bed narrowly missing their heads. It struck the door blocking their exit.</p><p>Dean and Lisa peeled themselves off the floor.</p><p>Dean cocked his gun at Perry.</p><p>“Let him go and maybe I’ll let you live to see your three-hundred and nineteenth birthday,” he growled.</p><p>“Oh Dean, you and I are going to have such fun together. Imagine wiling away the years, just you and me,” Perry said. “But not yet. Still have a lot of business to do here.”</p><p>Perry walked toward Ben and took out a sharp blade.</p><p>“This is what you don’t understand Dean: All my powerful friends passed away a long, long time ago, so now we are just trying to get the old gang back together. We have a big gig coming up. But to do that, we need nice innocent young things like Ben here. You’d be sacrificing him to a good cause.”</p><p>Dean pointed his gun at Perry.</p><p>“Get away from him, bitch.”</p><p>“Dean, that’s no way to speak to your betrothed,” Perry said. She put the knife to Ben’s throat and ran it up and down the muscles of his neck. “You’re not in control of this situation. I am. And it would behoove you to learn some old-fashioned manners!”</p><p>Perry sliced the knife across Ben’s cheek for emphasis.</p><p>Lisa screamed and pulled the trigger on the gun she was holding. The bullet zinged toward Perry. She stepped out of the way, and the bullet grazed her shoulder. The wound cauterized immediately, like she wasn’t made of human flesh at all. Perry looked down at where the bullet had touched her. There was a rip in her shirt.</p><p>“This is my favorite shirt. Now look what you did to it!” She clenched her hand and Ben started choking. “This will be cleaner anyway.”</p><p>Ben’s eyes rolled back into his head as his face turned blue. His hands clenched and unclenched, straining at the wrist straps.</p><p>Dean stepped forward and leveled his gun at Perry.</p><p>“You’re way too old for him.” He pulled the trigger.</p><p>The bullet blasted through her right wrist, detaching it so that the five-finger stump of her hand hung loosely from a couple of tendons attached to her arm.</p><p>Seizing the moment, Dean sped across the room and knocked the witch to the floor. Recovering quickly, Perry scissor-kicked Dean. He ducked and landed on top of Perry, grabbed her round the neck with both hands and squeezed. She struggled against him but Dean’s whole body weight was pinning her down. He held on until she looked as though she had passed out. He then released her throat and pulled her up so he could hold her arms tight behind her back.</p><p>“Let’s tie her up,” he said.</p><p>Lisa walked over to Perry and kicked her with a well-placed sandal heel under the ribs. She used the rope that Perry had used to secure Ben to tie Perry firmly to the base of the electric chair, while Dean kept hold of her, just in case.</p><p>Dean then picked Ben up off the chair and heaved him onto his shoulder.</p><p>Ben’s eyes slowly fluttered open.</p><p>“What happened? Where am I?’</p><p>“All I can say is no more dates for you, buddy,” Dean said gently.</p><p>Perry quickly came round and struggled against her bonds.</p><p>“You can’t take him!” she cried and shut her eyes, mustering her powers once again.</p><p>Lisa, and Dean with Ben over his shoulder, didn’t wait to see what would happen next. They exited the room, Dean indicating to Lisa that she should grab the discarded iron bar, then ran back down the hallway. As they crossed over the salt lines more asylum ghosts swarmed around them. Dean remembered he had taken the salt shells out of the sawed-off.</p><p>“Ben, grab those shells in my pocket and load them into this gun,” Dean said, holding the sawed-off over his shoulder.</p><p>Ben grabbed it, and refilled it while still being carried over Dean’s shoulder. Lisa swung at the ghosts with the iron bar as best she could, clearing a path for Dean and Ben. Ben handed the gun back to Dean and then took the other and filled it in turn with salt shells. Dean then set him down and started shooting, protecting their sides and rear as they leapt forward down the dark tunnel.</p><p>“Almost there,” Lisa called from ahead. They reached the spiral staircase and raced upward. Once in the bedroom, Dean pulled the heavy dresser in front of the doorway.</p><p>“That’s not going to hold her for long,” Dean said as they left the apartment and ran down the hallway.</p><p>Outside, they piled into the car. Dean started the engine and they squealed out around the long oval loop surrounding the planned community. The car jumped off the curb and peeled into traffic.</p><p>Two miles down the highway Dean spotted a used-car dealership. He pulled the CRV around back.</p><p>“What are we doing?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“We need a new car—Perry knows this one,” Dean said, hopping out of the vehicle and approaching a grubby salesman.</p><p>Minutes later Dean came back. “Okay, everyone out.”</p><p>“Dean, I love this car. I’m still making payments on it,” Lisa protested.</p><p>“You aren’t now. Now you’re making payments on this.” He gestured to an old Ford 100 truck which looked as if it had been through a war. “Actually, I’m kidding. No payments.” Dean handed Lisa a stack of one hundred dollar bills. “We can buy a newer model when we get back.”</p><p>“Yeah, exactly when is that going to be, Dean? I think I’ve had enough of this vacation,” Lisa said as they climbed into the truck with Ben between them.</p><p>“Soon, Lisa. Soon,” Dean replied.</p><p>He pulled the truck back into traffic and headed north. Dean knew he couldn’t go home now. There was too much at stake. This had come to be about much more than getting Sam back—these witches were up to something. Something big and horrible.</p><p>“Just a little bit longer,” Dean said.</p><p>He pulled the truck into a rundown motel and jumped out.</p><p>“Why are we stopping here?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“New digs. I’ll be back in a second.”</p><p>Dean left them in the car and headed into the New England colonial-themed lobby, complete with a Paul Revere statue.</p><p><span class="italic">This is more like it,</span> he thought.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-nine">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam sat on the bar stool staring into space, but when the hot blonde, twenty-something in the tight jeans and the Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky T-shirt walked in—he noticed. Her right hand was bandaged up to the elbow but she still held herself with much more poise than was usual for someone her age. She looked around the bar and sat down a couple of stools away from Sam.</p><p>“Whiskey, water back please,” she called to the bartender.</p><p>The bartender, a grizzled old Red Sox fan, peered at her through the gloom.</p><p>“Gonna have to see some ID, young lady,” he said, lumbering toward her.</p><p>The girl dug her hand into her pocket but came out empty. She leaned over the bar, smiled and gently touched the man’s hand.</p><p>“I don’t have it. But I’m good, right?”</p><p>The man blinked a couple of times, as if he had forgotten the question he had asked two seconds earlier.</p><p>“Sure, sweetheart. No problem,” he said.</p><p>He returned with her drink a few moments later.</p><p>“It’s on him.” The bartender nodded toward Sam at the end of the bar.</p><p>Sam raised his drink in the girl’s direction.</p><p>“You’re persuasive. I like that in a woman,” Sam said.</p><p>The girl eyed him. Then she slipped off her stool and took the seat next to him.</p><p>“I’m glad. Not many men do. Usually they’re scared of me.”</p><p>“I don’t see why,” Sam said, “you seem perfectly sweet to me.”</p><p>“I do? Well, thanks. I’m Prudence, by the way.” The girl leaned over and stuck out her hand.</p><p>“Sam. Nice to meet you. Prudence? Interesting name.”</p><p>“Old family name,” she said. “I used to hate it, but over the years I’ve gotten used to it. Cheers,” she said, raising her glass to clink with Sam’s.</p><p>Sam looked at the girl. She was definitely do-able.</p><p>“Why don’t you come back to my room? I have a six-pack and another one in the fridge. We could get to know one another better.” Sam ran his hand down his stomach, indicating one of the six-packs.</p><p>“Does that work on all the girls?” Prudence asked.</p><p>“Pretty much, yeah,” Sam said.</p><p>“Guess it’s working now too,” she said, throwing back her whiskey. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They headed toward the door. Sam walked behind the girl to admire the view. She was cute, very cute.</p><p>Back at the motel, Sam popped open two beer bottles. He held one out to Prudence, then hesitated.</p><p>“You’re over twenty-one right? I wouldn’t want to be accused of corrupting a minor.”</p><p>“Way over. But thanks for your concern,” Prudence said, taking the bottle. She strolled around the colonial-themed hotel room. “Nice place. I remember when this was just a field, not a parking lot and a chintzy motel.”</p><p>“Really?” Sam stepped behind her and pushed his hand down her shirt. Prudence turned around and looked into Sam’s eyes.</p><p>“There’s something you should know about me,” she said.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“I’m more experienced than I look.” Prudence smiled and started undressing.</p><p>Sam did the same and dropped onto the bed. Prudence approached him, took off the rest of her clothes and started to ravenously kiss him. Sam pulled her small body onto his.</p><p>“What happened to your hand?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Misunderstanding. I got greedy. Took something before I should have. Patience is key. I forget that sometimes.”</p><p>“I’m having trouble being patient right now,” Sam said, angling himself under her.</p><p>Sam reached to shut off the light. He glanced at the little notepad neatly placed underneath the Paul Revere-like lantern lamp. On the heading it said: “YE OLDE COLONIAL INN est. 1919.”</p><p>“You remember this place when it was just a field?” he asked casually.</p><p>Prudence continued to nibble on his ear.</p><p>“Yeah, why?” she said as she straddled him. “You remind me of a horse I once had.”</p><p>“Giddy-up,” Sam said.</p><p>A little while later, Sam got up from the bed. He pulled on his jeans.</p><p>“Where are you going? I was just getting ready for more.” Prudence patted the bed beside her.</p><p>“Just looking for something I think you’ll like,” Sam said, digging into his duffle bag. “Here it is.”</p><p>Sam swung around and pointed his sawed-off shotgun at her.</p><p>Prudence looked up at him.</p><p>“Whatever,” she said, laying back down on the pillows. “Second time today, no big deal. When are you people going to get it into your heads that I can’t be killed... Not like that, anyway.”</p><p>Sam advanced on her.</p><p>“So what are you? A shapeshifter? Werewolf? What?”</p><p>Prudence ignored the gun and instead climbed off the bed and grabbed her T-shirt.</p><p>“I’m a witch, ya big ox. And an old one at that. But I still need to get out and let loose. It’s been a very stressful summer.”</p><p>A cord of rope hit her in the back as she pulled on her jeans. Sam stood closer now, still aiming the gun at her.</p><p>“Sit down and tie your feet.”</p><p>“You really think something like this is going to hold me?” Prudence asked over her shoulder.</p><p>“Take a closer look,” Sam said.</p><p>Prudence held the rope up and noticed a weave of different herbs braided into the cord and a smelly paste rubbed into the crevices.</p><p>“Think of it as my own lasso of truth,” he said.</p><p>Prudence sat mechanically in the straight-backed chair next to the bed and tied her feet to its legs.</p><p>“What are you going to do to me, Sam? You know, I would have let you tie me up if you’d asked.”</p><p>“Stop yapping. I’m going to ask you questions and you’re going to answer them. Get it?”</p><p>Setting aside the sawed-off, he pulled the ropes tightly around Prudence’s lithe wrists, conscious of securing them as tight as possible around her bandaged one. He then left her and went into the bathroom. Pipes creaked and there was the sound of water rushing into the bathtub. Back in the room, he grabbed another chair, swung it around, sat down and crossed his arms over the back, resting his chin on his wrists. He stared at Prudence.</p><p>“So let’s play ‘What the hell are the witches doing?’ shall we? First question: Why are you resurrecting bodies? Whose are they?”</p><p>Prudence’s lips broke into a smile, her tiny, pearl-white teeth gnashed together.</p><p>“Oh games? I love games. But you have to play by the rules. One question at a time. But I’ll answer both for you. None of your freaking business. And screw off.”</p><p>“Wrong,” Sam said.</p><p>He stood up and spun the chair around. He grabbed the back of Prudence’s chair with one hand and his chair with the other and dragged both into the bathroom. He set the empty chair sideways next to the bathtub so that the legs pointed parallel to the side of the tub. Next he hefted Prudence’s chair so that her head hung halfway into the filled tub.</p><p>“So this is what we are going to do,” he began “Again. I hate to repeat myself. You’re going to answer my questions and if you don’t, you get dunked.” To demonstrate, Sam lifted the legs of Prudence’s chair and her head dipped into the water. Sam then righted the chair. “See? It’s a lot of fun.”</p><p>“Whatever, Sam, I took swimming lessons in the thirties. Eighteen thirties. That’s not going to do anything to me.”</p><p>“Oh, I forgot something,” Sam said. From his back pocket he pulled out a polyester pillowcase. He thrust it over her head and re-dunked her. “Now, officially, this isn’t happening. Just remember that if you ever go up in front of Congress.”</p><p>He pulled her back up. Prudence strained to catch her breath. But with each breath the wet material caught in her mouth, making it impossible to take in air.</p><p>Sam stood back and watched her panic.</p><p>Then he dunked her back into the water, <span class="italic">One Mississippi, two Mississippi...</span> and brought her back up.</p><p>“Let’s try that again,” he said. “Why are you resurrecting bodies?”</p><p>Prudence gasped and flailed her head from one side to the other.</p><p>“It’s a process,” she gasped. “A means to an end.”</p><p>“What’s the end?”</p><p>Prudence stayed silent. Sam tipped the chair back again.</p><p>“Okay, okay. We need the power, for a larger purpose. We’re resurrecting the most powerful witches of all time, most from back when we first came to this country.”</p><p>“Why?” Sam asked. “Keep talking.”</p><p>“I can’t breathe. Take the hood off. Please,” Prudence whined.</p><p>Sam whipped the pillowcase off her head and she gulped air.</p><p>“Keep talking,” Sam directed.</p><p>“Let me catch my breath,” Prudence wheezed.</p><p>Sam sat on the toilet, impatient.</p><p>Prudence looked at him. A smile crossed her face.</p><p>“What are you smiling at?” he growled.</p><p>“Oh nothing. Just you. Men. Big, stupid babies with no ability to understand cause and effect.”</p><p>“What the hell does that mean?” Sam said.</p><p>“You forgot what water does, asshole,” Prudence said.</p><p>Sam glanced into the tub and saw that the dark paste that he had rubbed on the rope had come off during the dunkings. Prudence’s long hair cascaded down her back, soaking both her shirt and the ties that bound her. In an instant, she tore apart the rope that bound her wrists, threw out her hand and Sam flew out of the bathroom and landed on his back in the middle of the bedroom.</p><p>“Give a lady her privacy, will you?” Prudence slammed the bathroom door behind her.</p><p>Sam got up and staggered toward the door. He pounded on it.</p><p>The door flew open. Prudence was completely free of her bonds and it seemed she wasn’t in the mood for talking. With a flick of her wrist she threw Sam against the motel room door. He slumped down, trying to not to lose consciousness.</p><p>“What is it with you Campbells? Why can’t you stay out of the way?”</p><p>“How do you know I’m a Campbell?” Sam demanded.</p><p>Prudence stomped over to Sam, picked him up by the collar and bent down until they were face to face.</p><p>“Because I can smell it on you,” she spat. “You’re always the goody goody do-gooders who come to rescue everyone. When it’s really <span class="italic">you people</span> who need rescuing. The funny thing is you’ve been doing it for hundreds of years and you still haven’t learned.”</p><p>“You know, I see your yapper moving, but I really don’t care.”</p><p>Prudence swung her leg over Sam’s lap and straddled him.</p><p>“You of all people should care, Sam Winchester. Because even though little you is up <span class="italic">here,</span> the real man-of-the-hour is below. And now that he’s out of that pesky cage, with all those super seals broken, he can be freed again.”</p><p>“How do you know about that?” Sam struggled to move, but her legs held him tightly in place. <span class="italic">Who the hell is this little bitch?</span> he wondered.</p><p>“Really, you’re going to ask me that? Do you have any idea how powerful I am? How powerful my family is? I know everything about you. Besides word gets around in certain circles.</p><p>“I’m sort of pleased to meet you actually. It’s a bit of an honor. Lucifer’s vessel. Too bad he still isn’t in it. That would have been one hell of a honeymoon.”</p><p>“You want to spring Lucifer? That’s ridiculous. That’s suicide,” Sam said.</p><p>“For a human like you. For powerful witches, not so much. Still difficult. No one aces their SATs on the first try. We didn’t in 1692, but we didn’t have all the facts. We didn’t know about the seals. But compared to his previous prison, Lucifer is in a bed and breakfast. And we’re going to get him out.”</p><p>“You can’t put a collar around his neck. He’s not going to do what you tell him. Believe me, we’ve tried,” Sam said.</p><p>“Oh yes he will. We have a little book that we’ve been using for ages. It’s not an Oprah pick—the human sacrifices alone would make that a no-go for her. But it’s very powerful and it’s going to take Lucifer and wrap him around all our little fingers. After we raise him, he’ll do exactly what we tell him to do.”</p><p>“It will never work,” Sam said.</p><p>“Third time’s the charm. You know, we tried again when you were born, thinking maybe the seals were broken when you popped out. But no such luck. But now. Thanks to you. Well, we can’t lose.</p><p>“I must say I’m glad this body got saved though.” She ran her finger down his chest. “Because it is a specimen. See, I have a little theory: You’re up here, Lucifer is down there, but you guys were specially made for one another. I think if this works, he’s gonna pop into you like a hand into a glove. Hmm. Somehow that turns me on a little.” Prudence ran her tongue up Sam’s cheek. “Yummy. Anyway, I would love to stay and chat but we have three more sacrifices to make before the big day. We will be seeing a lot of one another. Very soon.”</p><p>“You can’t do that. You can’t raise him,” Sam said.</p><p>“Oh Sammy, don’t tell me what I can and cannot do. Besides we are raising <span class="italic">all</span> the Princes of Hell. So, don’t worry, Lucifer won’t be lonely. He’s going to have all his brothers with him. Unlike you. Got to run. Bye now.” Prudence leaned down and gave Sam one last salty kiss on the mouth. Then she left.</p><p>Sam pulled himself up and headed for the mini-fridge. He took out a bottle of beer and sat on the bed mulling over the night’s events. Going after Prudence would prove futile at this point He’d have to wait and catch them in the act. And what would happen if the witches actually succeeded in raising Lucifer again? Would he come after him? Sam shook his head. He wasn’t scared, he actually felt very little. Revenge was the only thing he could feel; he only cared about getting those witches. It was a need. Not even a rational thought. It was the only thing he could concentrate on.</p><p>Sam stood up, grabbed his duffle and left the motel room. He walked down the cement sidewalk that ringed the motel rooms, passing room five. Then got into the van and left.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Ten feet away inside room five, Dean thumbed frantically through Nathaniel’s journal. He needed to know what Perry was talking about. If she was three-hundred-and-eighteen years old, as she said she was, then she had to have been involved in the Salem witch trials. Which meant she had to have a connection to Constance. Killing young people, resurrecting bodies--what were the witches up to?</p><p>“What did you give him?” Lisa asked.</p><p>She sat propped up on the other bed. Ben slumbered beside her. Dean had figured the kid would need a good night’s rest, what with his encounter with Perry and the events of the day, and as being tied up could have adverse affects on a child, and maybe a clear head and a good breakfast would make the experience a little more manageable for him...</p><p>“Just a little something. Don’t worry. It’s prescription,” Dean said.</p><p>“That’s what I’m worried about.”</p><p>Dean turned back to Nathaniel’s journal. He wondered if there was a way to raise Sam and stop Connie in the process. He came across a passage and started reading.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty">CHAPTER THIRTY</span><a href="#chapter-thirty" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Nathaniel and the boys set off for town the next morning. They knew Constance was a witch, and the boys’ encounter with Prudence proved that she was too. Nathaniel warned Caleb and Thomas to be extra careful. They didn’t know what the witch’s next move would be. Nathaniel suspected that it had to do with the unearthed graves, but he had no proof. The one thing he was keenly aware of was that he had to stop the witch trials. Innocent people were being sent to jail and soon the hangings would begin.</p><p>Nathaniel and his sons reached the meetinghouse a little late. Every day the building would be so packed full of people that a crowd would form outside the door, spilling onto the street. The Campbells pushed their way into the room and found places at the very back in a corner. Three new people had been accused of witchcraft, and they were brought up to the stand and questioned. In most cases, the accused were so frightened that they weren’t able to answer the magistrates’ questions clearly, which only made things worse.</p><p>After an hour or so of futile questioning, two men appeared in the doorway dragging a woman between them. As they pushed their way through the crowd, Nathaniel recognized the woman as Bridget Bishop, who twelve years before had been accused of witchcraft, though at the time no proof had been found. As she was pushed before the magistrates, the crowd started to spit accusations.</p><p>The afflicted girls took one look at her and started to scream. Bridget covered her ears with her hands and the girls did the same. Everything Bridget did, the girls pantomimed, contorting themselves as if their movements were being painfully forced from their bodies.</p><p>The judges called for calm.</p><p>Judge William Stoughton, who had been appointed by the governor, spoke first. He asked Bridget if she knew why she had been brought in front of the court. She said she didn’t know. Stoughton told her that she was accused of hurting the girls through witchcraft. He pointed to the afflicted girls, including Prudence Lewis, in the corner. Bridget replied that she didn’t know the girls.</p><p>As she spoke, Prudence started to wail and writhe around. The other girls followed suit. The crowd rumbled with fear and anger, convinced that Bridget was hurting the girls before their very eyes. Bridget started to cry.</p><p>Anger rose inside Nathaniel until he could stand it no more.</p><p>“Your honors, I’d like to speak if I may,” he called. Nathaniel raised his hand and pressed forward through the crowd. All heads turned to look at him as he moved. A murmur swelled from the crowd and passed like a wave out into the street. <span class="italic">Nathaniel Campbell has something to say.</span> The magistrates lifted their eyes at this new interruption.</p><p>Nathaniel reached the front of the room and addressed the judges. His voice rang loud and clear and the crowd hushed so they could hear his words.</p><p>“Magistrates, I’d like to speak on behalf of the accused,” he began. “By my count you have some sixty-two people in jail for witchcraft at the present.”</p><p>William Stoughton responded, “Mr. Campbell, you do realize that this court has recently been appointed as a court of Oyer and Terminer by the governor of Massachusetts?”</p><p>“I do know that, yes. But that doesn’t change the fact that you have imprisoned a large number of people. And the proof that they are witches, well...” Nathaniel paused, then continued, “Your proof, sirs, is like smoke.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Stoughton asked.</p><p>“If I set a fire right here—“ Nathaniel began.</p><p>“Surely you wouldn’t do that,” Stoughton said.</p><p>“You’re right. But this is an example. If I set a fire with you on one side of the smoke and me on the other, you would see the smoke one way and I would see it another way.”</p><p>“I don’t understand your meaning,” Stoughton said.</p><p>“We would both see smoke, but it would look different to you than it would to me because of the different places we are standing, you over there, and me here. As the smoke twists and turns it looks even more different. If we both had to describe the smoke, you would not recognize what I described and I would not recognize what you described, even though we were looking at the same fire.”</p><p>“What is your point, Mr. Campbell?” Stoughton asked. “We are running short on time.”</p><p>“I would think that when lives are at stake accuracy is as important as expediency,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>Stoughton’s face tightened.</p><p>“I’d like you to arrive at your argument, Mr. Campbell.”</p><p>“Judge Stoughton, the afflicted girls are describing what smoke looks like from where they are seated. And others are describing what smoke looks like from where they are. Both are correct, but perhaps that means that neither is more right than the other.”</p><p>“Are you wasting our time, Mr. Campbell?” Stoughton asked. His patience was clearly running out.</p><p>Nathaniel took a deep breath. He had to make the judges see what was clear as day to him.</p><p>“Perhaps what this woman did isn’t being perceived correctly by those young women over there,” he said, keeping his voice clear and steady. “Perhaps they are feeling hurt, but it isn’t coming from this woman.”</p><p>“Are you accusing these young girls of lying, Mr. Campbell?” the judge’s voice was steely.</p><p>“I’m not saying they are lying,” Nathaniel replied, “only that perhaps they are mistaken.”</p><p>Prudence stopped her hysterics for a second and stared at Nathaniel. She then started to scream and point at him.</p><p>“Stop! Stop, you evil man!” she yelled. “I’ve done nothing to you and you are pinching and scraping me!”</p><p>The judges looked at Prudence as she writhed in pain, red welts swelling on cheeks. Then they turned back toward Nathaniel.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, why are you hurting this innocent girl?” Stoughton demanded.</p><p>“I’m not,” Nathaniel replied firmly. “I am but standing here.”</p><p>“But she says you are hurting her. Look how she writhes in pain.”</p><p>Prudence continued to scream and cry.</p><p>“Seize him!” Stoughton declared and gestured that the two men standing closest to Nathaniel should restrain him. The men immediately grasped hold of Nathaniel, holding him tightly so that he had no hope of escape. “Nathaniel Campbell you are charged with witchcraft. Take him to the jail.”</p><p>Nathaniel was marched forcefully through the crowd and out into the cold morning air.</p><p>Panicked, Caleb and Thomas pushed through the other onlookers to follow their father. They stumbled out of the building to see the men drag Nathaniel to a cart and throw him into the back. He recovered quickly and turned around, frantically scanning the crowd, searching for his children.</p><p>“Father!” the boys shouted, racing toward him.</p><p>“Boys! Go tell your mother. Don’t worry about me. Watch Prudence, she’s dangerous. Find out what she and Constance are doing!” Nathaniel called as the cart pulled away.</p><p>The two brothers looked at one another, realizing they were on their own. They stealthily returned to the packed meetinghouse. As they walked in, Thomas looked over at Prudence. She stared back at him with a small smirk on her face.</p><p>“You stay here,” Thomas whispered to Caleb. “I’m going to go tell Mother.”</p><p>Caleb nodded and Thomas crept out of the meetinghouse. He took his father’s horse from the post and rode home quickly over the same field where Prudence had attacked them.</p><p>When he reached the Campbell homestead, his mother was outside feeding the pigs. Thomas leapt from the horse and quickly explained what had happened.</p><p>Rose Mary called for Hannah. They would visit Nathaniel in jail.</p><p>The women quickly got ready. Hannah took a couple of silver pieces from an old box. She also packed a basket full of food, since many prisoners didn’t get fed at all in jail.</p><p>Back outside, the three said goodbye and agreed that they would meet back at home that evening to exchange news.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-one">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The snow and the freeze had melted in only a couple of weeks and the damp smell of spring was making the village all the more jumpy. Now that the weather was better, it had been decided that the hangings should begin. The crowd buzzed around the meetinghouse like angry bees waiting for the next victim. As soon as the last paper was signed the accused were taken out of the meetinghouse and loaded onto a wooden cart.</p><p>The entire village would then follow the creaking cart into Salem Town as it made its way off the main road and up the grassy hill. In each instance, Prudence Lewis followed behind the crowd, supported by her uncle and Reverend Parris. She among all the girls insisted on witnessing the deaths of those she had accused.</p><p>Bridget Bishop had been the first to be hanged. The entire village had come out to see her undoing.</p><p>After the first hanging it seemed as if the town could not wait for more. Another hanging was scheduled for two days later, and after that it seemed as if the hangings didn’t stop. Day after day, women and men were brought from the jail to the hill and hung until they were dead. Some protested their innocence even up to the last moment, as their heads were pushed through the noose. Others stayed silent.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb watched the proceedings from a grassy field, far from the eyes of the townspeople. Since Nathaniel’s arrest and imprisonment, they had kept out of sight. Their mother was the only one that went into town. The children stayed home. While Nathaniel was in jail, they didn’t want to provoke the witches.</p><p>Day after day they went over the question of what exactly the witches were up to. Accusations of witchcraft had become rampant in Salem, with any strange behavior leading to accusations between friends and neighbours. However, the Campbells’ only real concern was Constance and Prudence. Both were powerful, dangerous witches. But proving that to the judges seemed impossible. It was clear that Prudence was puppeting the trials, but why?</p><p>There were over a hundred accused people, many of them held in the same jail as Nathaniel. With each passing day, the family feared that Nathaniel would be the next to be called up by the magistrates and hanged.</p><p>After witnessing a particularly brutal hanging early one morning, Thomas and Caleb made their way home through the woods and fields. They followed their usual route which took them far from Salem Village, out of the range of the prying eyes of any hysterical villagers or vengeful witches. As they entered a clutch of trees, they came across a small hill they normally didn’t pay much attention to, hidden as it was from the view of the main path. Today, they both paused and stared as the knoll was dotted with dirt mounds. Someone had clearly tried to hide freshly dug earth under piles of branches spiked with furry new leaves. Curious, the boys cleared away the branches.</p><p>“You first,” Thomas said.</p><p>“Why me?” Caleb sighed.</p><p>“Because you’re the youngest,” Thomas insisted.</p><p>Caleb knew what he had to do. He knelt down and started scooping the earth away with both hands. The dirt came apart easily, and soon body parts started to appear like gruesome spring flowers. Thomas knelt down to help his brother.</p><p>They uncovered five bodies in all, each with their throat cut, just like they had seen on the dead bodies of Abigail Faulkner and the transient. They didn’t recognize any of the corpses. Clearly, the witches had got smart and decided that murdering travelers and hiding the bodies was a more efficient way of operating.</p><p>“What should we do?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“We need to tell Father,” Thomas said.</p><p>“How can we do that? They won’t let us in to see him,” Caleb pointed out.</p><p>“I guess we need to handle this by ourselves then,” Thomas said. The boys slid down the hill and headed toward home.</p><p>* * *</p><p>That night Caleb, Thomas, and Hannah dressed in dark clothing and stealthily rode toward the jail in Salem Town, Hannah on her mother’s horse and the boys riding their father’s. Unlike Salem Village, the town was heavily populated as it crowded around a couple of inlets with the bay stretching beyond to the sea.</p><p>The children dismounted a couple of blocks from the jail and tied the horses up behind an old barn. The jail was an imposing red stone building set on a grassy plain, which meant approaching would be difficult without the guards noticing. Pulling out his pocketknife, Thomas cut down branches and grass and draped them over himself and his siblings for camouflage.</p><p>Moving slowly and silently, they crawled toward the building.</p><p>Once they had reached the safety of its dark shadows, they shed the branches and Thomas took from his pack a long rope with an iron hook on the end. He whipped the rope up with practiced ease and caught the hook on the stone balustrade at the top of the building.</p><p>Caleb then grasped the rope and started walking up the wall. His goal was a narrow barred window some thirty feet up. Hannah had visited the jail with her mother on several occasions so she knew roughly where the cells were and which hallways led where. She was confident that this particular window led to a small hallway that should be deserted at night. Nathaniel was being kept two floors below.</p><p>Halfway up the side of the building, Caleb lost his footing and he smacked against the stone wall with a thud. Hannah gasped, and she and Thomas dived for cover under their discarded camouflage branches.</p><p>There was a loud clang as the guard opened the gate and peeked around the side of the building from which Caleb dangled. Fortunately, he didn’t look up, and in the faint moonlight failed to spot Thomas and Hannah holding their breath beneath the branches.</p><p>After a few moments, the guard went back to the front of the building, but it was clear he didn’t immediately go back inside. The smell of a pipe stuffed with English tobacco wafted around the corner.</p><p>Time was running short. Shaking off the branches, Hannah gestured frantically for Caleb to continue climbing. When he reached the window he slid one leg in, then the other, and disappeared from view.</p><p>Inside the building, Caleb dropped four feet to the ground, and there was a faint splash as his boots hit the wet stone floor. The inside of the jail was cold and dark, and the stench of human waste was almost overpowering. Caleb could hear someone groaning in one of the cells closest to him. He shivered, feeling a tingle of fear go down his spine.</p><p>Pushing the thought aside he got out the rough sketch Hannah had supplied him with. He examined the piece of paper by the faint light from the window, then inched forward into the darkness. A staircase in the back corner of the building should lead him down to his father’s cell.</p><p>“Who’s there?” a female voice whispered out of the darkness. “Please, sir. Please help me.”</p><p>Knowing he couldn’t afford a moment’s distraction, Caleb stopped and hoped that the woman would think he was gone.</p><p>“Please sir, come closer,” the voice said.</p><p>Caleb crept over to a small three-foot-by-two-foot cell. He could see the faint outline of a woman huddled in the corner.</p><p>“Sir, Dorcas Good, Sarah Good’s daughter, is over in the cell beyond. Please see if she’s well. Her mother was hanged and no one has spoken or seen to her in weeks.”</p><p>“I will,” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Is that you, Caleb?” the woman crawled toward him. Caleb could now see it was Marium Teller. An old woman who used to sell apples on the street.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. It is me,” Caleb replied.</p><p>“What a good boy you are. Are you helping your father this fine day in your fields?”</p><p>Caleb eyed the poor old woman, she had clearly lost her mind. In his jacket pocket he had stuffed a couple of loaves of bread. Caleb took one out and slid it between the bars for the old woman. He then continued down the hallway, moving as softly as he could.</p><p>In an even tinier, damper cell, chained to the wall, was four-year-old Dorcas Good. Her mother had been one of the first to be accused of witchcraft and she had been second to be hanged after Bridget Bishop. Dorcas was filthy and covered in dirt and her own feces, Caleb struggled not to recoil from the smell. The tiny girl looked at him with wild, untamed eyes. Caleb pushed his last loaf of bread toward her. She grabbed it and started to tear into it with her teeth like an animal. The sight tore at Caleb’s heartstrings. Despite her being such a tiny child, Dorcas had been accused of witchcraft. How the magistrates could think such a thing was impossible to know.</p><p>In the faint moonlight, Caleb found the staircase and made his way carefully down two flights of stairs and onto another corridor of cells. He passed Marshall Lewis, a man who was accused of witchcraft because his neighbor’s horse went lame after they had an argument.</p><p>“Hey you boy!” Marshall called out. “Whatcha doin’ here?”</p><p>“Shushh,” Caleb said.</p><p>“Hey guards. Guards! What’s this boy doin?”</p><p>Caleb frantically looked for a place to hide, he noticed two bars of one cell were a little more spread apart then the rest. He squeezed through them and found himself in a cell with a sleeping woman.</p><p>A minute or so later, he heard the guards march heavily along the corridor coming to investigate the commotion.</p><p>“There’s a boy in here. There’s a boy in here,” Marshall cried.</p><p>“Shut up, ye old coot,” a guard said, spitting on him.</p><p>“But he’s there, he’s over there!”</p><p>The guard undid the lock on the man’s cell and gave him a slap with a bully bat. Marshall huddled in the corner until the guard tired of beating him and left.</p><p>Caleb waited until the coast was clear and then climbed out from between the bars. He pitied the man, who was clearly crazy, but his second close encounter with the guards only made him want to escape this terrible place even more quickly.</p><p>He crept on and a few minutes later, to his relief, he found Nathaniel’s cell.</p><p>“Father?” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Caleb. Dear boy.” Nathaniel reached through the bars and grasped his son’s shoulder affectionately. “How on Earth did you get in here, and how do you think we’re going to get out?”</p><p>“Thomas thought of something. Don’t worry,” Caleb replied with a smile.</p><p>Reaching into his jacket for his tools, Caleb deftly picked the lock on the cell just like his father had taught him.</p><p>The two Campbells moved swiftly and silently down the corridor, they turned a corner and paused. The guards were close by. Caleb gestured for his father to wait.</p><p>At that moment, they heard a terrible wail of pain coming from outside the jail.</p><p>It was followed quickly by a sudden commotion as the guards rushed outside to see what was going on. Nathaniel and Caleb crept cautiously down the stairs and toward the entrance to the building. The guards had all fled outside, bar one, who Nathaniel swiftly took care of with a carefully placed blow to the head.</p><p>From the gate of the jail in the distance, Nathaniel and Caleb could see a bonfire surrounded by robed figures. It looked like a gathering of witches but in actuality, as Caleb explained briefly to his father, it was a series of sticks clothed in Hannah’s old dresses. The guards crept closer, convinced by the firelight casting strange shadows that they were about to surprise a witchy gathering.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Caleb slipped away. As they ran, Nathaniel looked to his youngest son.</p><p>“Well done, Caleb,” Nathaniel said. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“All those poor people in jail. They’re not witches, Father.”</p><p>“I know. We’re going to take care of this, I promise.”</p><p>They hurried to find Hannah and Thomas.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-two">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean flipped the pages and noticed a note written in different handwriting in the top right-hand corner of the journal:</p><p>This is the last journal entry by Nathaniel Campbell.</p><p>Fall 1692</p><p>Much joy and pain I feel tonight. As I write this, night falls around my cozy house. A home filled with my family and love like nothing else. But it is tonight that I must go out and fight perhaps the most hideous evil I have seen in my many days as a hunter.</p><p>For posterity now seems to be the perfect time to recount my induction into the profession of being a hunter.</p><p>It was very fortunate that my family and Rose Mary’s met on the treacherous voyage to the New World. As it turned out, there would be two families of the same profession in this New World, hers and mine. Of course, this was before we both were born. My father and Rose Mary’s father fostered a strong friendship and created a pact to protect each other’s families. With that pact they also promised to pass along the family profession. Sadly, Rose Mary’s mother died in childbirth in 1650. This brought our two families even closer. My father had married a hunter, and my mother’s mother was a hunter too.</p><p>Because of her mother’s passing Rose Mary and I were very close, and she would often visit my parents’ homestead. In fact our parents were close until the day Rose Mary’s family perished in a wendigo attack, and only she survived. My father never forgave himself for being unable to save his friend and his family.</p><p>When we came of age at ten years old, my father took us both out to the woods. I must recount that both Rose Mary and I were most afraid of what my father was about to do. Until this time we didn’t know about hunting, we thought our parents were simple farmers. But, of course, that was not the case. My father took us a mile from the house into the darkest recesses of the woods and I will never forget the sight before me. Tied to a tree, chained with iron shackles, was a naked man shivering in the cool night air. Rose Mary squealed, but then held her tongue. I, however, knew that my father wouldn’t have shown us this strange sight unless there was a lesson to be learned. He handed Rose Mary and I a flintlock musket each. The weapons felt heavy and unwieldy in our small hands.</p><p>“What are we to do with this?” I asked.</p><p>“Just wait and watch,” my father replied sternly.</p><p>As the moon rose full over the woods, slowly the man before us started to snarl. Then he began to arch his body, howling in pain as silver hair sprouted over his entire body. Eventually what stood before us was a man no longer, but rather a most uncommon beast—a wolf.</p><p>So hideous and frightening was the sight that Rose Mary cowered and I wanted to turn away, but my father insisted we keep our eyes on the creature. Still shackled to the tree, the wolf paced and gnashed his awful teeth. He lunged at us as if there wasn’t a man inside him at all.</p><p>“See the animal before you,” my father said, “he was once a man. A good man. But he has been unfortunately cursed. He was bitten by a creature, much like the creature you see before you now. It’s in his nature to roam these woods and hunt and eat humans. The man inside him would surely be appalled by such acts. But the animal, it’s his instinct. What do you think the man would feel if tomorrow he woke up and remembered all the awful things his animal self had done in the night?”</p><p>Rose Mary piped up, “He would surely feel most awful.”</p><p>“Exactly Rose Mary, he would hate himself. He would be ashamed, and he might even turn his rage upon himself. But he won’t stop. He can’t stop, because this animal is inside him. The one blessing is that he won’t remember his actions as a beast once he turns back into a man. But he will kill. So what do you think this man would ask us to do?”</p><p>“He would surely ask us to kill him to save the people he might kill,” I offered. “If he was a good man he would.”</p><p>“You are exactly right, Nathaniel. You are such a smart boy. He would ask us to kill him. So the question is. Who will help this man tonight?”</p><p>Rose Mary and I looked at one another. Neither of us had ever held a gun, much less thought of killing a man. But it was without question the right thing to do. The animal that paced and growled before us would do much harm. Harm that the man inside of would be horrified at.</p><p>Rose Mary and I agreed to level our muskets at the same moment, thus neither of us could singularly feel guilty for killing the creature. And that is what we did. Father told us that only a silver bullet would kill the animal. As much as I was saddened about our act, it was the right thing to do.</p><p>I recall that story because that animal was a man beneath. And it is always an awful thing to kill a man. But there is a greater good to be served. As I go into the fight tonight with my own two sons by my side I will tell them that story, because it’s with a heavy heart that I know there will be lives lost. We must kill the witches, or we ourselves will be killed. Though they are most undoubtedly human, they are evil. And we must eradicate them.</p><p>I consider myself a most lucky man for having lived the life I have. I found a most loving and wonderful wife early in my life and my three children are my ultimate joy. This hard and sometimes lonely life of hunting would be intolerable if it wasn’t for them.</p><p>Dear family, if you are reading this, I’ve either lost my facilities or come to my end. Please remember that I love you all. I will meet you in heaven most surely.</p><p>Your father,</p><p>Nathaniel Campbell.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-three">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In loving memory of Nathaniel Campbell and Rose Mary Campbell, loving parents to Thomas, Caleb and Hannah.</p><p>My siblings and I thought it appropriate to close my father’s journal with the last entry relating his death. Perhaps later generations will be able to draw wisdom from his sacrifice. The remaining pages have been written by Thomas Campbell, age fifteen, Fall 1692.</p><p>The night that my brother Caleb and I broke my father out of jail, the village of Salem had turned to chaos. After my father confronted the magistrates and unveiled Prudence as a witch, most of residents went into hiding. Rightly so, for they had sat within a few feet of her for weeks, under her spell and believing every accusation she made. Upon discovery, Prudence fled. The night that followed would be the last night my father and mother spent in this corporeal realm. This is what happened.</p><p>Later that night, we retreated to our home. When we opened the door we realized that the witches had been there before us. Our mother had disappeared. She had set out our secret signal that something had gone wrong, so we knew that she had been either forcibly taken or was already dead. Our parents made up this signal for us when we were small children and they would go out hunting. If something bad happened, Father told us to turn over a tea cup and leave it on the kitchen table. That is what we saw when we entered the silent house. It was our mother’s sign to us.</p><p>My father was weakened from exhaustion and lack of food in prison but he wouldn’t stop to rest. He immediately pulled up the hidden door set underneath our kitchen table—built into the floor we had an arsenal for emergency use. Now was such an emergency.</p><p>We armed ourselves and forced my father to drink a warm cup of broth, then we set out for Constance’s property. We knew that Constance and Prudence were close to accomplishing a most evil task. So evil of a task that my brother and I hardly wanted to think of it. Raising the devil wasn’t something father had trained us against. Raising the devil would essentially make Hell on Earth. Both my brother and I knew that we must defeat the witches or risk losing the entire New World to evil.</p><p>Hannah made sure we were all warmly wrapped up and we left her behind, well armed, to guard our home. Father kissed her on the forehead before leaving.</p><p>“My dear girl,” he said, “you are the strongest, smartest young woman to walk the face of God’s great Earth. Do not ever change.”</p><p>A single tear streaked down Hannah’s cheek as though she already knew what was in store for my father.</p><p>“Don’t behave as though you will never see me again,” she said. “I’ll make sure there is a home for you to come back to.”</p><p>We took my father’s horse, our most sure-footed and silent. We would tie him up away from the fight in case one of us needed to flee or fetch help. Though I think we all knew there was no more help to get.</p><p>As we approached Constance’s residence, the lights of a hundred witches’ lanterns showed through the trees. Most of the figures were obscured behind a small knoll, so we could not see where our mother was. Father gave us the signal to wait. We sorted out our weapons on the damp ground. After a few minutes, the congregation of witches began to chant, their horrible voices building in strength and power as they continued.</p><p>Then a sound echoed through the woods which will be forever burned into my soul: my mother’s screams.</p><p>We grabbed our guns and crawled up the hill on our stomachs. Down below was a most horrific sight. A hundred witches chanted in unison, most no more than resurrected bodies of rotting flesh and bone. These putrid, wretched beings were now animated living things once again. Their voices were pitched low and threatening, and the noise continued to build, until our heads felt full of the horrible sound.</p><p>The witches moved around a great fire built in the shape of a ring. Inside the ring a hole was filled with perfectly round rocks. In front of the fire a large platform had been erected. This is where my poor mother kneeled. I knew she was scared. As proficient a hunter as she may be, no one could face down a hundred witches and not fear for her life.</p><p>Terror washed over my father’s face. There were many more witches than we had previously thought, the resurrections more numerous than we could ever have imagined. There must have been many more murders than we had discovered. All those people, including poor Abigail Faulkner, had been used as sacrifices for these resurrections.</p><p>I thought about the innocent people that the magistrates had sent to the gallows. They were not among the witches. The accused were all good, God-fearing, innocent members of the church, yet they had been put to death.</p><p>At that moment, two more witches appeared out of the woods dragging the body of a man. He seemed to be alive. Closer inspection revealed it to be Reverend Parris. The witches brought him to face a witch who was dressed in ceremonial garb. As she turned her head, I saw with a shiver that it was Prudence. She shot out her arm and lifted his petrified face to hers. The chanting halted and her sneering voice carried to our ears through the still night air.</p><p>“Why Reverend, why are you so scared? It is I, innocent little Prudence. Perhaps my station takes you as a bit of surprise. But you didn’t really think all those innocent people were really witches did you? Well I suppose you did. But it had to be done. You would surely have paid much too much attention to the dead bodies popping up around Salem Village if we hadn’t created another antagonist for you to concentrate your foolish beliefs. You sir, and I say this having known my fair share of men of God, are a pitiful, greedy human being. The kind of man who doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone.”</p><p>Reverend Parris cried out like an infant.</p><p>“Why have you brought me here? I am not one of your evil clan.”</p><p>Prudence smiled. “But you are, Reverend. You blindly followed a group of hysterical children, and you used them to do your bidding. One by one you eradicated your enemies.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you speak of,” the Reverend moaned.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, Reverend. Of course you do. Don’t you remember the nights you spent with your sweet little niece by the fire? Where you would placidly recount who you thought might be practicing witchcraft? What impressionable young woman wouldn’t want to please you. Especially one so easily swayed. That is how you made sure everyone in the village with whom you had a disagreement was jailed or hanged.”</p><p>“That’s not true! I’m not what you say,” the Reverend cried.</p><p>“Don’t try to deny it, Reverend. Make your peace with God, this will be your last night on Earth. You’ll be meeting Him soon enough.”</p><p>With that she flicked her hand and the Reverend flew up in the air. He landed on the ground some distance away with his leg at a most unnatural angle. He cried out in pain. But Prudence ignored him, turning her attention instead to our mother. Mother was silent, but I knew she was afraid.</p><p>My father turned to Caleb and I.</p><p>“Boys, we will surely be outnumbered. We are but three against a hundred powerful wtiches. You must go ask for King Philip’s help. We need more men. Unfortunately we didn’t part on good terms last we spoke but try to convince him of our need. If we don’t stop the witches, our world as well as Philip’s tribe and way of life will be endangered. The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> could destroy the entire world. Please get him and his men. They <span class="italic">must</span> come.”</p><p>Caleb and I nodded. We knew the Wampanoag Indians were fierce warriors, they had killed many colonists from Boston to the territories north. Caleb and I had never traveled east to their land; moreover, we had never gone such a distance alone. King Philip had fostered a friendship with Father and he had always come to our house. The thought of a long, hurried journey on horseback through the night was daunting but the moonlight would light our way.</p><p>We said goodbye to Father, slid back down the hill and silently slipped away. We led the horse for a mile over the meadow so our retreat wouldn’t be heard by the witches. Riding tandem, we escaped east.</p><p>We rode hard, crossing dark fields and still darker woodlands. We crossed over a series of streams and soon came to a cliff that led down to a river. Beyond the water lay the woods that bordered King Philip’s territory.</p><p>We crossed the river at a shallow point, keeping our legs raised clear of the rushing water. By necessity we made a disturbance, and as soon as we got to the other side we knew that one of Philip’s scouts had seen us. Within a mile, we came to a clearing and found ourselves surrounded by Wampanoag Indians. These men were fierce, proud people and when they moved you could see their power and skill. We dismounted and waited, soothing our agitated horse and soon King Philip came forward.</p><p>I approached him respectfully.</p><p>“Please accept our humble apologies for arriving without invitation. But my father, your friend, Nathaniel Campbell, urgently needs your help and that of your men.”</p><p>King Philip was a most handsome man, tall, powerful. He ran his nation deftly and had the skills of any colonist negotiator. I didn’t know whether I would be able to convince him to help. Any fifteen-year-old would have been nervous, and I was shaking in my boots.</p><p>“Why should I put my men at risk? Your father is a most kind and learned man, but I cannot lead my men into a battle which doesn’t concern them,” he said.</p><p>I thought for a moment. I wasn’t sure what my response should be. He was right, of course—why should he put his men in danger? I knew I had to be cunning without being defensive or impolite.</p><p>“Gracious King, there are witches in Salem who are conspiring to open up the gates to Hell—they are trying to summon the devil. If they succeed, the evil will spread past the boundaries of our colony to you and your people. Your men would be drawn into a fight with the creatures of Hell. The witches will not heed the river which is a barrier between your nation and our colony.”</p><p>“Your Christian gods do not frighten us, we have our own protector spirits,” King Philip replied.</p><p>“I’m very respectful of them,” I said, “as is my father. However, the evil that will unfurl over this land will be too great for even your most powerful protectors. I understand caution. My father speaks of it often. But in this is not the time for prudence, this is a time for action. I beg of you to lend us some of your men.”</p><p>“You do not require my presence?” King Philip asked.</p><p>“We would like nothing more, for you are a powerful warrior, but my father wouldn’t think of asking you to put yourself at risk. You have a great nation to run.”</p><p>King Philip thought for a moment.</p><p>“I always appreciate a courteous word from a colonist, but I must refuse your plea. My nation and its safety is the most important thing and I cannot lead them into peril.”</p><p>I nodded respectfully. What else could I do? Caleb opened his mouth to protest, but I shot him a look to silence him. We bowed and received a gift of fresh water in a skin from King Philip’s wife, and then we left. Once we were out of earshot, Caleb began to weep.</p><p>“Stop that,” I said. “We will find a way to defeat the witches. But not if you have such soft resolve.”</p><p>Caleb wiped away his tears and we dug our heels into the horse’s sides to push it forward and back into the river. That’s when we heard the pounding of hooves from behind us. King Philip had allowed his men to fight. They came in full warrior regalia. Caleb and I were filled with hope and we gave them our thanks. They followed us back across the river.</p><p>It was another hour at full gallop to reach the village and then ten minutes to get to the edge of Constance’s lands. We dismounted a mile away and led the horses closer. The Indian horses were well trained and didn’t make a sound as we approached.</p><p>My father saw us coming and came to meet us. He greeted the men’s leader, who was King Philip’s brother, and together through gestures—for the brother did not speak English—they made plans. The Indians would circle the witches while my father created a diversion, and with guns drawn Caleb and I would free our mother.</p><p>The Indians moved off silently to take their places.</p><p>When I peeked back over the knoll a most unsettling sight lay before me. My mother had been led down to the ring of fire, and the witches encircled her, their voices louder than ever. Constance led the crescendo of chanting, calling upon the four Princes of Hell to rise.</p><p>The first she called forth was Belial.</p><p>Seeing the dire situation before us, my father started the <span class="italic">attack</span> with swift signal to King Philip’s men.</p><p>Moments later, the Indians emerged from the woods. The orange firelight illuminated their painted brown-skinned bodies and they looked like other-worldly warriors. In an explosion of action, they attacked the witches, their large sticks and spears impaling and beheading the enemy in turn. Muskets were drawn and bullets flew.</p><p>Seizing our moment, in the midst of the chaos, Caleb and I ran down the hill, stumbling and tripping toward the fire. It seemed the resurrected witches were easily brought down with a musket shot to the head or a quick stab through the heart.</p><p>However, Prudence and Constance proved to be much harder to defeat.</p><p>When Caleb and I reached the bottom of the hill, Prudence attacked us from the left. Caleb pulled back his musket to shoot, but she grabbed it and flung it into the fire. It landed on the rocks with a clatter. She flew at Caleb and caught him by the neck. He was thrown down with such force that his body made a mark in the earth.</p><p>Grasping a burning log from the fire, I swung it at Prudence’s head from behind. She flipped over to face me, somehow unhurt, and flinging the log from my hands, she encircled my neck with her fingers. I fought to breathe, realizing as I choked that my adversary must be weaker than she had been, since she was using physical force for her attack rather than spells or the black arts. It seemed most of her energy had been sucked away by the resurrection still taking place a few feet from our fight.</p><p>From the corner of my eye I could see my mother struggling against Constance’s powerful grip as she held her over a large brass bowl. The fire glinted off a large knife that the tall witch brandished in her other hand. Just as she raised her arm to strike, my father attacked Constance from behind. Constance let go of Mother and she fell into the edge of the fire. She rolled away but was unable to get up, as her hands and feet were tied. I struggled harder against Prudence, desperate to warn my mother of the approaching danger, but the witch was still too strong and I watched in horror as another old woman caught my mother by the nape of the neck.</p><p>This new woman seemed more powerful than the other resurrected witches. She slung my mother over her shoulder with ease. She took Mother back to the brass bowl, and again held her over it.</p><p>With a wrench I momentarily freed myself from Prudence and managed a croaked scream, but Prudence gained footing and hit me on the side of the head, my vision blurred for a few seconds and she caught hold of me again.</p><p>Still battling Constance, my father reached out to my mother, but it was too late. The strong old witch picked up a knife. The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> lay open at her side. She started to chant. I desperately fought Prudence but her grip only intensified. Caleb was surrounded by three witches and was unable to get off a shot. Another witch bore down on him and knocked him off balance. He swerved, catching his foot in one of the stones near the fire.</p><p>The old witch continued to chant from the book then she held the knife across my poor mother’s neck and slit the life out of her. My mother’s blood drained into the brass bowl and at that moment a deep rumbling echoed through the woods.</p><p>My father threw Constance off him and kneeled at my mother’s side. Her head slid to one side and my father pressed his face to her breast, the life drained from her dear, pure heart. My father grabbed the book from the old woman with one hand, with the other he drew his pistol and shot her between the eyes.</p><p>Constance was embroiled in a fight with one of the fierce Indian warriors, so with the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> in hand, Father moved away into the shadows. I knew that the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> held powerful spells, but it also held their reversals.</p><p>Suddenly the stones in the center of the ring of fire started to drop as if a deep hole had opened up beneath them. The rumbling grew louder, and the earth beneath our feet became warm. A blast of heat, far surpassing the sun on the hottest of any June day, emanated from the hole. The fire ring almost doused itself; the heat coming forth from the hole seemed hotter than fire.</p><p>I tried to roll away from Prudence but she held me fast.</p><p>King Philip’s Indian warriors, men of great resolve, stopped their fighting and stared at the hole. It hurt to look in the direction of the fiery pit, but no one could draw their eyes away from the figure that was slowly rising up from the earth.</p><p>Constance shook off her adversary.</p><p>“Belial, I call you forth,” she shouted. “I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth.” She repeated the chant over and over, her voice louder and louder. While the creature, with great horns, gradually dissolved into the shape of a man.</p><p>Constance caught one of her young farm hands by the arm, pulled him close, and, grabbing the knife, started to chant once again. I realized she was trying to raise the second Prince of Hell, whose name I knew to be Leviathan.</p><p>My father reappeared from the shadows. He was holding the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and had his own buck knife in his other hand.</p><p>“Evil, vile creature,” he cried out to Constance. His voice steady and true. “You will not succeed in creating Hell on Earth.”</p><p>Then he started to chant from the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>“Oh god of dark and god of light. You are summoned no more. Hide your evilness in the cage from which you came, you are not wanted on this mortal plain. I forbade <span class="italic">vos of atrum pergo huic regnum. Vos es inconcessus ut ingredior inter lux lucis. Vos es inconcessus ut futurus in is terra. Vado tergum qua vos venit. Vado tergum ut vestri cage. Vos es non volo. Per vox of lux lucis quod filiolus of Olympus quod bonus verto tergum ut atrum.”</span></p><p>And with that my dear father took the knife and sliced his own neck. He fell into a heap, his blood mixed with my mother’s in the bowl.</p><p>An inhuman scream echoed forth from the creature in the middle of the fire. Frigid air pushed forth from all corners of the wood, extinguishing the fire, and the figure disappeared back into the hellish fire at its feet. The earth closed up and rocks tumbled back into their place, imprisoning the Prince of Hell back in his fiery domain.</p><p>With the beast’s disappearance the resurrected witches started to visibly lose energy, making them a lot easier to kill. Caleb extracted himself and beheaded a slew of the old bags of bones. I wrestled from Prudence’s now much weaker grasp and swung around ready to attack Constance, but she and Prudence retreated swiftly into the woods, disappearing from view. Two of the Indian warriors went after them, but they came back minutes later. The women had evaporated.</p><p>We rapidly executed the rest of the witches, and threw their bodies into the middle of the ring. We piled wood on top of them and re-set the fire. Leaving the bodies for others to find would serve no purpose except to frighten them. We had what we needed to end the frenzy within the village.</p><p>I approached the quivering figure of Reverend Parris. He attempted to stand but was unable. I helped him up, supported him back to one of the horses, then helped him mount. As he tried to walk away I held the reigns.</p><p>“Reverend Parris? What say you to what you saw this evening?” I asked.</p><p>“Young man, I can hardly believe my eyes. I must return home and pray about it,” he replied avoiding my direct gaze.</p><p>“That is not what I meant,” I said. “You will call off the witch trials now. You will petition for the release of every jailed innocent. Will you not?”</p><p>He nodded, still not looking at me.</p><p>“Let me hear you say it,” I said.</p><p>“I will do everything in my power to release the innocent and I will tell the magistrates that the afflicted girls have been healed by the hand of God. Salem Village no longer harbors Satan.”</p><p>“Very well, have a safe ride home,” I said. “You never know what might lurk in the shadows.”</p><p>A look of panic crossed the Reverend’s face. He rode unsteadily off across the meadow.</p><p>By this time the early morning light was illuminating the carnage before us. Caleb leaned over the bodies of our poor parents as he recited the Lord’s Prayer. I stood beside him and joined in. The Indians had made a litter from logs and pine boughs. We laid Mother and Father on it and covered them with a torn coat.</p><p>The warriors promised to tell King Philip of Nathaniel’s bravery. I thanked them for their fight. Without them we surely would have been defeated. The Indians then galloped off quickly, they didn’t want to be caught on colony land during daylight. And with that Caleb and I headed toward home carrying our deceased parents.</p><p>As we approached home, Hannah appeared at the door and came to meet us. As she neared us her face was stricken with both relief at our survival and grief for our parents. We brought them inside and prepared their bodies for burial. We wanted them to be interred on our homestead and not in the village cemetery.</p><p>Our hearts were heavy that night. But one thing was clear. Our father would want us to continue hunting the evil in this world. In the early dawn light Caleb and I spoke about it. We debated when and how to tell our sister who was asleep in the next room. I knew after I recounted this story she would understand why we had to leave Salem and seek out others in need of our help. Though I feared she would be lonely I knew it was essential for her to stay in Salem and see the Reverend kept all his promises.</p><p>I left her the following letter.</p><p>Dearest Hannah</p><p>When you wake, Caleb and I will be gone. I hope you understand that after tonight saying goodbye to you would too hard. But knowing your strength and wisdom you will understand why we needed to leave. After the fight with the Salem witches, Caleb and I realized that all the country villages and towns are being abused and attacked by the kinds of evil we know how to fight. It would be lovely and comfortable to stay with you here, to see you marry and have a family. It would be lovely and comfortable for Caleb and I to do the same. But we feel that would be wrong and selfish. The world outside Salem needs us.</p><p>Please understand that our choice was not an easy one. And leaving you alone perhaps was not what Mother and Father would have wanted. But I know you’ll agree that there is a greater good at work.</p><p>We hope that God grants you a long and happy life. If ever we come by this way again, please leave the light on for us. You will forever be in our hearts and prayers. Keep up on your Latin, you are the best scholar in the family.</p><p>God bless.</p><p>Your loving brothers,</p><p>Thomas and Caleb.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-four">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean closed Nathaniel’s journal, there were no more entries. Constance was Connie, Dean was certain of that, and could Perry be Prudence, or was that taking things too far? Though there wasn’t an exact map in the journal, Dean was pretty sure Constance had occupied the same house all these years. He guessed that she must stay hidden for a couple of generations and every now and then, after a while had passed, she would return to public life. That way no one could grow suspicious of her longevity. It was sort of the perfect way to exist forever.</p><p>Now, after all this time, Connie once again had the opportunity to raise Lucifer and as much as it hurt him, Dean now saw that he couldn’t let her do it. Sam would be forever bound to a coven of witches and Dean could not unleash that evil upon the world. He had to find a way to stop them.</p><p>He watched Lisa and Ben sleeping soundly, both had dropped off fully clothed on the other bed. Dean had explained that now was not the time to get cushy. Hunters slept in their clothes as you never knew what might wake you up in the morning. The TV blared out late night infomercials. Dean got up and checked his wallet, a couple of towns over there was a twenty-four-hour hardware store. He would need some rope, more salt, just in case, and, of course, knives. Buying ammo was going to be a tad harder at this hour of the night, but he could figure that out later.</p><p>Dean left the motel room quietly, careful not to wake Lisa and Ben. He got into the truck, noting that the motel parking lot was empty except for a white van parked in the far corner. Dean started the ignition and pulled away.</p><p>Sam watched Dean pull away in that nasty truck from inside the white van. He could have followed his brother, but he knew he didn’t have to take care of him. The thing that he wanted to take care of was the fact that Prudence had a tail on him. On his way here a small two-door hatchback had made every turn Sam did, and was now parked across the street from the motel.</p><p>It wasn’t Prudence herself behind the wheel, but Sam was pretty sure he recognized the girl as one of the ones from the bookstore break-in. She was probably put in charge of tallying Sam’s every move to make sure he didn’t get in the way of the remaining resurrections.</p><p>The only thing on Sam’s mind was how to take the witches down. Whether they were human or not didn’t matter to him. He didn’t know where the witches were planning this resurrection. And he had to find out. He could waste a lot of shoe leather. Or he could deliver two of the last resurrections to the witches on a plate. Pulling transients over and killing them couldn’t be easy. Perhaps he would just force the witches’ hand.</p><p>Sam pulled a mask on over his head, took out his sawed-off and loaded it with just one bullet. He wouldn’t need to call Prudence; the girl across the street would do that for him. He got out of the van and braced himself in front of the motel door to Lisa and Ben’s room.</p><p>CRACKKK!</p><p>Sam’s foot splintered the door off the jamb. Inside the room, Lisa sat up quickly, eyes bulging with fear, but Sam slapped her across the face before she could start screaming. She rolled over the bottom of the bed. Ben stirred in his sleep, but stayed unconscious—Sam guessed that Dean had given him a sleeping pill.</p><p>Lisa crawled across the ground toward one of Dean’s bags. Sam, staying silent lest he give his identity away, pulled the bag out of her reach. He roughly flipped her over onto her stomach and tied her hands and feet together with zip lines.</p><p>“Wh-why are you doing this?” she cried. “Please, just take me, leave my son!”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He grabbed a balled-up T-shirt of Dean’s and stuffed it into her mouth. Next he rolled Ben onto his stomach and tied both his hands and feet together. Ben snored loudly, unaware that his de facto uncle was setting him up for a kidnapping.</p><p>Lisa continued to try to scream through her gag, but the noise was muffled and ineffective.</p><p>Sam’s entire set-up had taken less than two minutes. He headed back outside and closed the door behind him. He looked at the car across the street. The girl’s faint outline could be seen through the dark windows of her crappy car. She was peering at him as he emerged from the motel. Sam smiled. There was no way she wouldn’t be curious.</p><p>Sam got into his van, took off his mask and pulled out of the parking lot. He raced up the highway until he was out of sight of the girl’s car. Then he made a rapid U-turn, came back around, and parked in a donut shop parking lot facing the street.</p><p>About half a mile down the road, Sam spotted a figure racing across the four-lane highway and into the parking lot of the motel. It took about a minute for the girl to return. She ran back across the road and slid back into her car and pulled it around into the motel parking lot. Being a witch, Sam surmised that she would be strong enough to carry Lisa and Ben out of their motel room and into her hatchback.</p><p>Sam waited until he saw the car pull out. It headed toward him, north up the highway. He crouched down, but the van was indistinct enough among all the other vans in the donut shop car park that the girl drove past without noticing. A few seconds later, Sam pulled out and followed her, a safe ten car-lengths behind.</p><p>Sam guessed that the girl probably didn’t have time to ask her superiors about whether or not to bring the two victims home. She had acted on instinct and that was to Sam’s advantage. She would lead him right to the resurrection sight. He hoped he would be able to deal with the witches without getting Dean involved. Meanwhile Sam wouldn’t actually let the witches harm Lisa and Ben. That wasn’t the plan. The plan was to stop the witches and systematically kill them all. Sam glanced into the back of the van. It was chock full of enough explosives to rip a hole in the Lincoln Tunnel, except Sam was going to use it to stop a different kind of destruction.</p><p>Sam continued following the car as it turned onto Route 128 and headed north.</p><p>Dean got out of the van balancing a bag of donuts, two coffees for him and Lisa, and a hot chocolate for Ben. He thought they could have a quick breakfast and maybe then he would put them on a train back to Cicero. It would be easier and safer to wrap this up without them. He had already put them through enough.</p><p>Dean had no idea how he was going to stop the witches, he would make it up on the spot, like usual. The only thing he was hoping for was that the witches hadn’t picked up anymore transients. But he had taken care of that by calling Officer Wiggims and putting out an ABP on both Perry’s car, which he had seen earlier in the week, and whatever caravan of cars Connie owned. At least then Connie would find it a little more difficult to get around town.</p><p>The motel door was cracked open. Dean immediately put down his provisions and took out his gun.</p><p>“Lisa? Ben?” Dean called.</p><p>He kicked open what remained of the door, and through the dim light he could see that both beds were empty. A quick scan of the room told him that someone had been pulled off the bed, the coverlet was on the floor at the foot. And there was a little piece of plastic, the kind that sometimes pops off a plastic zip tie. Most police officers use them, but Dean didn’t believe they had been arrested.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle bag, noticing that it wasn’t where he left it. Instead it had been thrown into a corner, out of reach. On the table, a paper cup was turned upside down.</p><p>Months ago, when Dean and Lisa were talking about Dean’s childhood, he had shared the signal John Winchester had taught him when he and Sam were young. “If the shit goes down, try to turn a cup over on the table. It won’t look out of place to anyone but us,” John had said. Dean knew someone had taken Lisa and Ben. He ran out the door and into the motel lobby, but the bored young woman behind the counter hadn’t seen anything.</p><p>In the truck, Dean popped open his laptop, it seemed that Lisa’s cell phone had been disarmed. The last time it pinged off a cell phone tower was nineteen miles north of Salem, toward the shore. After that, someone had turned off the GPS in the town of Gloucester. He decided to start there.</p><p>Dean peeled into traffic. He desperately wanted to call Bobby for a little help, maybe he could do more legwork on tracking down the cell phone, but he didn’t have time. As he pulled onto Route 128 he noticed in his rear-view a black Escalade barreling down on him. Dean pushed the pedal to the floor, but the old truck only belched out a trickle more horsepower.</p><p>“Should’ve taken the Impala,” Dean muttered to himself.</p><p>The Escalade pulled out from behind him and into the adjacent lane of the highway. The large car then swerved deliberately into Dean’s driver’s side. Dean’s truck swerved onto the sandy side of the road, and fishtailed. Dean fought the heavy vehicle to regain control and then he righted himself back onto the road. But there was no way to outrun the newer vehicle.</p><p>The Escalade pulled in behind the truck and hit its bumper with a CRAAASSHH, jolting Dean into the steering wheel. Dean willed the truck forward and steeled himself for another hit. The Escalade came full force and lifted the truck’s back wheels off the road.</p><p>Seconds later, it crashed back down, the shocks gave way and Dean’s back absorbed a good amount of the jolt from the old bench truck seat.</p><p>Dean tried to swerve to escape another hit, but the Escalade was too quick, it rammed into the rear bumper of the truck and it spun around into oncoming traffic. Dean cut the wheel and bumped roughly back into the correct lane.</p><p>The Escalade came back again and surged forward, passing Dean. He craned his neck to get a look into the car, but couldn’t see past the tinted windows.</p><p>The black car cut him off again. Dean slowed down and desperately reached beside him for his duffle which had slid onto the floor. Keeping his eyes on the road, and one hand on the wheel, Dean felt for the strap, grasped it, and pulled the bag into his lap. He fished out his sawed-off and leaned out of the side window, aiming the gun at the back window of the Escalade. The driver hit the brakes, sending the car skidding to a stop. Dean jammed on his brakes in turn, and the old mechanism squealed in response.</p><p>He couldn’t stop in time and the truck hit the large car with such force that Dean’s chin almost reached the windshield. The truck teetered on the front two wheels, then crashed back down. It gave one last sputter and the radiator exploded.</p><p>Satisfied, the Escalade sped off.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle bag and got out of the truck, ignoring the other drivers honking at his sudden halt. He was battered and bruised and now more desperate than ever to find Lisa and Ben.</p><p>He knew he needed to keep heading north. On his right side he could feel the cool wind of a storm pushing in from the sea. He assumed if he kept walking forward eventually he’d come to a town. Just then, a large sixteen-wheeler slowed and stopped in front of him. Dean climbed onto the runner. The driver rolled down his window. He was a wizened old guy in a trucker’s cap, and bore a strong resemblance to Bobby.</p><p>“You need a lift?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah, if you wouldn’t mind. Going to Gloucester,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s not too far. Get in,” the truck driver groused.</p><p>A mile down the road Dean realized that he had left his laptop in the truck. He desperately tried to look up the address of the last ping of Lisa’s cell phone on his phone. But the site just indicated that the cell had somehow passed through town.</p><p>“What’s past Gloucester? Anything?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Well, there’s Rockport. It’s a little hoity-toity for the likes of you though,” the trucker replied.</p><p>“Actually, I think that might do,” Dean said.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” the driver said. “Mind if I put on the radio?”</p><p>The driver hit the AM button. A traffic report blared through. Then a serious-sounding newscaster repeated a warning that an Amber alert had been issued for a teenage girl last seen getting into a black Escalade. Dean realized that the witches, in a desperate attempt to get hold of a couple more bodies, had not only take Ben and Lisa but also a poor girl just out for a walk by the beach.</p><p>They pulled through Gloucester and after a few miles on the seafront road came to Rockport.</p><p>“Gotta let you off here,” the driver said.</p><p>Dean thanked him and hopped out of the truck cab. Rockport was a quaint small town pressing up against the rocky shore on the Atlantic Ocean. Dean looked around. Even though it was summer, with a storm coming in, there wasn’t much of a crowd. Off in the distance, dark clouds hugged the horizon and lightning illuminated large patches of water miles out to sea.</p><p>Dean pulled up his collar, made sure that Nathaniel’s journal was snug inside his jacket, and started walking. Around a bend in the road, he saw in the distance several large houses clinging to the side of the shore. Further past them, an enormous house perched on top of a hill. One side of the property was ringed with long rocky boulders that stretched into the sea.</p><p>Dean pulled out his binoculars and trained them on the property. Panning around the area, he noticed a dust cloud which was being kicked up by a black Escalade as it wound its way up the road to the house. Taking a deep breath, he resisted the urge to kick the road in frustration. Even if the witches were hiding out in that grand house on the hill, he still had to find a way to stop them. He needed to get inside the house and fast.</p><p>As the thunder rumbled ever closer, the street was rapidly emptying of tourists. Dean glanced around and his gaze quickly settled on an ancient-looking hatchback, not the kind of car likely to have a sophisticated alarm system fitted. As casually as he could manage under the circumstances, Dean sauntered to the car and swiftly broke in—a minute later he was on the move, tires squealing as he sped away.</p><p>He parked further down the hill, then made his way up a sandy path toward the large wrap around front porch. As his foot stepped on the porch a shot rang out. Dean whirled around to find Perry standing behind him with a large shotgun trained right at his head.</p><p>“Let’s not disturb the occupants,” she said inclining her head toward the front door of the house. “I would hate to drag more innocent people into this. I mean soon enough, <span class="italic">everyone</span> is going to be dragged into it. But why single anyone out?”</p><p>“This isn’t your place?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No, silly, why would we have a place out here?” Perry replied.</p><p>“Lisa’s cell phone?”</p><p>“Just dropped it into a garbage truck that happened to be going north. I needed to get you out of Salem. Connie’s orders. I was pissed, I admit. I’ve been taking her shit for hundreds of years. But I’ll get to the festivities soon enough. As will you. I’m thinking you will be a special guest of honor. Why don’t you walk over here? And no funny stuff, the gun is just for show, but I have no problem roughing you up like I did before. Walk toward me, hands behind your head.”</p><p>Dean did as he was told. Perry quickly tied his hands together, and then his feet.</p><p>“Get into the truck,” she said opening the door and pushing Dean headfirst into the large trunk. A cage-like feature had been wound across the back of the car, creating a barrier between the back trunk space and the seats.</p><p>“You must have a big dog,” Dean said.</p><p>“Not yet, but you know opening up Hell might come with some problems.”</p><p>“Like hellhounds.”</p><p>“Wow, you know your Hell, Dean,” Perry said. “But of course you do.”</p><p>Dean looked her in the eye.</p><p>“I’m going telling you right now—by the end of today—you’ll be dead and I’ll have killed you,” he said.</p><p>For a split second a shadow crossed the witch’s girlish face.</p><p>“I’m the man to do it,” Dean continued grimly. “Maybe no one else for a hundred years has known what they were up against with you. But I do. You’re going to die today. Trust me.”</p><p>Perry slammed the back door, hoisted herself into the driver’s seat and peeled out of the driveway.</p><p>Dean desperately tried to free his hands but he couldn’t reach into his front pocket. He was stuck. The only good thing about this situation was that he was getting what he wanted. He was being taken directly to Lisa and Ben.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-five">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam followed the young witch as she drove west out of town. When she pulled off the main road and onto a residential street, Sam slowed, not wanting to follow too closely behind. She knew what he was driving after all. He watched the car take a long curve around a series of tall, brick, residential buildings that made up a planned community, dark woods loomed on the other side of the road.</p><p>The girl drove the vehicle around the side of the main building and down into an underground parking garage.</p><p>As he approached the main building, Sam noticed that there were a lot of people hanging around: teenagers loitering, old people sitting on benches in the shade of trees or buildings. He couldn’t help but think it was a strange place to have a witches’ gathering. Sam parked in the shadow of some trees in the far corner of the car park, pushed his sawed-off into the back of his jeans, and walked down the ramp leading into the underground parking garage.</p><p>The garage was about half full but the young witch’s car was nowhere to be found. Sam walked up and down each and every aisle, methodically checking license plates to make sure he hadn’t missed it. Then he caught sight of a wide steel door in the shape of a low arch on the far side of the garage.</p><p>Crouching down, Sam noticed a little brake fluid right under the door. This had to be from the jalopy the young witch was driving. Sam pushed against the door, it creaked open just enough for him to see that it was padlocked from the inside.</p><p>Sam scanned the cars, and noticed a truck with a “Handyman For Hire” sign on it. He peered into the back of the truck, and was pleased to see it was loaded with tools. Sam pulled out his sawed-off and with the butt of the gun broke the back window, stuck his arm inside and wrenched open the door. He rummaged in the truck bed until he found a pair of bolt cutters.</p><p>Armed with the cutters, he pushed on the steel doors again and jammed the bolt cutters in through the opening. The heavy chain broke with a loud CLAP, and fell to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>Sam slowly pushed open the steel door to reveal a low cavernous hallway. The space could fit about five cars, but only one was parked inside. The young witch’s. Shutting the door behind him he checked the car, quickly establishing that Lisa and Ben were no longer inside it.</p><p>Across the hallway was another wide door. But before he could approach it, Sam heard a noise. The roar of car engines coming from the parking garage. Sam crouched behind the young witch’s car, listening intently.</p><p>Footsteps approached the steel doors.</p><p>Sam looked up and spotted an old pipe that stretched across the ceiling. Gritting his teeth, he hoisted himself up and hung on with his hands and legs crossed.</p><p>Moments later, the steel doors creaked opened and two cars pulled in, one after the other. From his position on the pipe Sam couldn’t see how many people emerged from the cars, but several doors banged shut and the volume of chatter suggested five or six people, and they all sounded female. Knowing what a vulnerable position he was in, Sam willed them not to look up.</p><p>The noise level dropped as the women went through the second door and disappeared toward whatever lay beyond. Judging that the coast was clear, Sam untangled his grip on the pipe and dropped to the floor with a THUD.</p><p>“Well, what are you waiting for? Let’s go,” a voice said.</p><p>Sam spun around and came face to face with his grandfather.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What do you think I’m doing here? I’m making sure these bitches don’t actually succeed in raising the four Princes of Hell, particularly the guy who still wants to ride your hide. No need to thank me.”</p><p>“I don’t need your help. I can handle this alone,” Sam ground out.</p><p>“Yeah, I saw that. Nice bagging of the witch by the way. I mean I had my doubts about you, but I think that cinched the deal. I know things have changed since last time I was around, but I’m pretty sure coitus with a witch is frowned upon. If you needed to get laid that badly, son, I’m sure I could have arranged something”</p><p>Sam stood in silence, taking his grandfather’s verbal lashing without blinking an eye. <span class="italic">Whatever.</span> He just wanted to get to the fight. When Samuel paused for breath, Sam took his opportunity.</p><p>“Can we talk about this later?” he asked, indicating the door the witches had disappeared through. They were wasting valuable time. Time when he could be killing witches.</p><p>“Oh, we’re going to talk about it all right. I knew there was something wrong with you the moment I saw you. I don’t know what’s going on Sam, but once this is done with, we’re going to find out.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Sam said.</p><p>“No, son. I may have been dead, but my brain ain’t. Believe me, there is something off with you.”</p><p>The witches had shut the steel doors behind them before heading down the corridor and now a scratching sound came from the other side. Their argument immediately set aside, Samuel and Sam moved silently against opposite walls. Samuel leveled his gun. Sam turned his gun around, stock first. The door inched open. The small barrel of a pistol pushed through the opening. Sam nodded to his grandfather, Samuel swung the door open and Sam brutally bashed the stock of his gun into the perpetrator’s face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-six">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Where the hell are you taking me?” Dean demanded as he peeked over the back seat. Perry’s small frame was almost completely obscured by the large bucket seats.</p><p>“You’ll see,” she said.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, she pulled into a mall parking lot, parked and then got into the back seat.</p><p>“Hold on, let me get ready,” Perry said.</p><p>She pulled at her shirt collar tearing it, then to Dean’s bemusement she punched herself in the jaw. A large welt immediately formed on the side of her face.</p><p>“I bruise easily, sort of the price you pay for being over three hundred years old,” she said conversationally, smiling at Dean. He was gradually getting the point.</p><p>“Oh, one more thing,” Perry said as she opened up a door in the grate separating them. “Now be nice.”</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Dean asked.</p><p>She just smiled wickedly then took out a small vial of liquid. She grabbed Dean’s head with one hand and with the other pried his mouth open. He struggled against her, twisting his head back and forth but Perry had a grip like iron and he was powerless to stop her. She poured the liquid down his throat; he gagged and then swallowed instinctively. She released his head and instantly he fell back, feeling the paralysis spread through his body, until he was completely inert.</p><p>After a moment, seemingly satisfied, Perry crawled back into the back seat and shut the cage.</p><p>He heard the beeps as she dialed three digits into her cell phone. After a brief pause, she started to speak, her voice small and hesitant with a panicky edge.</p><p>“Yes, hello. My boyfriend... my boyfriend beat me up. I don’t know. One moment we where kissing and then he just got real rough. Yeah, he just went into the mall. I don’t know when he’ll be back. Can you come quick? Oh, thank you.” She gave the details of their location and then rang off.</p><p>“It will wear off by the time the police get here,” Perry said to Dean, her voice confident and gleeful again.</p><p>Just then the squeal of sirens erupted in the distance. Perry flicked her wrist and the binds on Dean’s legs and wrists immediately came off. She hopped out of the vehicle and popped open the back door.</p><p>“Whatcha’ gonna to do, Dean? Run and hide or face the music? Either way you’re not going to see your little GF and son ever again,” she gloated.</p><p>Dean swung his heavy legs onto the ground, stood up and tried to walk; it was a little more difficult than he remembered it being. He leaned on the side of the car, the sirens were getting closer.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you,” he croaked.</p><p>Perry pursed her lips as if seriously weighing that possibility.</p><p>“Eh, probably not. But you can always try. Here they come. Watch and learn, Dean, baby,” she purred.</p><p>A Salem Police squad car bumped into the parking lot and screeched around in a wide circle clearly trying to locate the emergency caller.</p><p>Pushing Perry out of his way, Dean took off in a Frankenstein-like run. He could still feel the paralyzing liquid coursing through his veins, and he had to will his stiff legs to keep moving. He headed for the tree line that ran down one side of the parking lot. He tripped and stumbled down into a ravine and splashed into a polluted little stream at the bottom. He could hear Perry’s screams coming from behind him, she was surely pointing his escape route out to the police.</p><p>A large drainage pipe led underneath a road, and Dean headed toward it hoping for a little refuge. Gritting his teeth through the stiffness, he stumbled through the pipe, his boots splashing through the fetid water, and emerged on the other side into a small run-off pond. He struggled to climb up the grassy slopes surrounding it, up and into a fast-food joint’s parking lot.</p><p>Not far from where Dean paused to catch his breath, a pudgy guy quickly exited his car on a burger run. Dean slid into the driver’s seat. He fumbled with a couple of wires underneath the dash, struggling with stiff fingers, but after a few seconds he touched them together. The spark egged the engine into jump-starting. Dean pulled swiftly out of the parking space. Checking his rearview mirror, he saw a couple of cops appear at the top of the grassy bank. He put his foot down and squealed out of the parking lot.</p><p>Dean bashed the steering wheel with his fists in frustration. He still didn’t know where Lisa and Ben were or what had happened to them—they could be dead by now. The witches’ latest sacrifices. He should never have brought them to Salem—what the hell had he been thinking? Family life and hunting just don’t mix. It was too dangerous. He had already lost Sam, what if he also lost Lisa and Ben?</p><p>He needed to figure out where the witches were. Trying to calm down and focus, Dean decided to head back to the library. He needed a map, an old one.</p><p>At the library the same old woman was at the desk. But minus his professorial clothes and clearly looking as rough as he felt, she looked at him much more skeptically.</p><p>“May I help you?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m looking for any old maps you might have of Salem?” Dean asked politely, trying to keep the edge of panic out of his voice.</p><p>“Everything we have can be found on the Internet if you go to—“</p><p>“Listen, I don’t have time for that,” he said urgently. “Where are the maps?”</p><p>She pointed to several large cabinets on the other side of the room. Dean nodded his thanks.</p><p>Aware of the woman’s eyes on him, he tried to be careful as he hurriedly pulled open each cabinet and riffled through the contents, painfully aware that he wasn’t sure exactly what he was looking for. Surely he’d know it when he saw it—he usually did. Then he noticed a modern map of the development plans for the Kirkbride Estates, where Perry had her apartment. It showed the series of buildings some of which had been demolished and some of which had been refurbished. His brain made a sudden connection and he went back to another map dating from 1786. It was the oldest the library had. Both the maps were to the same scale. He placed the older one, which clearly outlined old Salem Village, over the new one. Salem Village and the Kirkbride Estates lined up.</p><p>The circle in which the insane asylum and then the condos had been built was directly over what used to be Salem Village.</p><p>“So Salem Village was torn down?” he called over to the librarian.</p><p>“More or less,” she replied, “sure there are some buildings in Salem Town that date back to those days, and that were used during the witch trials, but Salem Village where the actual trials took place, those buildings were mostly demolished and left to rot. The insane asylum was built right tip-top on it.”</p><p>“Well ain’t that something.” Dean thanked the woman. Then he remembered something else. “Oh I need to see that Campbell journal again, if I could?”</p><p>She led him back to the reading room and produced the box in which Dean had left John’s journal, then left him alone.</p><p>Dean pulled the Campbell journal from his jacket and took one last look at it. His family came from a lineage of hunters who had always sacrificed themselves for the good of others. He only wished he could share his discovery with Sam.</p><p>He switched out the journals and left the library. But not without pocketing the last couple of pages of the Campbell journal. They were sort of his by rights, anyway.</p><p>Dean got back into his stolen car and headed to the Kirkbride Estates. He was going to have to do some real quick thinking since he was without guns or salt. He’d had to abandon his duffle bag when Perry pulled a gun on him back in Rockport.</p><p>As Dean pulled into the estate, he noticed something he hadn’t clocked the previous day, when he and Lisa had rescued Ben. A couple of kids were hanging around by the side of one of the buildings. A car approached and slowly came to a stop in front of them. One kid in a baseball cap leaned in through the passenger-side window, and something was passed between the driver and the kid. The kid nodded then went back to his friends. The car pulled away.</p><p>These kids were Salem drug dealers. <span class="italic">And where there were drugs, there were sure to be guns,</span> Dean mused. Thank God, Perry hadn’t found the wad of cash in his sock. Dean had never bought drugs; they were not something that was really worked with the hunter lifestyle. Hard liquor definitely, but drugs, not so much.</p><p>Dean stopped the car, but kept it idling in case he needed to get out quick. He tried his best swagger approaching the group of kids.</p><p>“You got a load in your pants, white boy?” one of the kids said.</p><p>Dean pushed down his pride.</p><p>“Listen man, I need to buy some shit from you.”</p><p>The boys laughed.</p><p>“You trippin’ if you think we’re going to sell to a plainclothes. Go back to Captain Crunch and tell him he ain’t catching us today,” the first kid said.</p><p>“I hate that fat freak,” Dean said. “I’m not working for anyone but myself, and I need some firepower like two minutes ago.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” another one of them spoke up. “What for? Hunting season hasn’t started yet.”</p><p>“Listen, I just need a sawed-off and if you have it, a couple pounds of salt, and anything you have that will blow up.”</p><p>The kids cracked up in his face.</p><p>His patience rapidly running out, Dean approached the closest heckler and elbowed him in the neck. As he fell, Dean pulled him up by the collar then dropped him at his feet. The kid writhed around in pain.</p><p>“Hey!” the first kid spoke again. “That some Schwarzenegger shit man. Why you do that to Tiny?”</p><p>“Because I’m not kidding and don’t have time for this crap,” Dean ground out. “What do you have? I have money and I need guns.”</p><p>“He for real,” a tall kid called from beside Dean’s idling stolen car. “Car’s hot.”</p><p>Dean looked back to the group of kids. The first kid stepped forward.</p><p>“You can go to prison for that shit you know,” he said.</p><p>“I’ve been to Hell. Try again,” Dean said.</p><p>“I believe this guy,” the kid said. “Okay, follow me. Just don’t wake up my Grams.”</p><p>Dean followed the kid in through a first-floor apartment door. Inside, an older black woman slept on the couch while the TV blared. The kid gestured for Dean to follow him into another room.</p><p>“I’m Tim by the way,” the kid said. He laid out two antique guns on his neatly made bed. “I got this and this,” he said, gesturing.</p><p>“Hey. I’m Dean. And no offence Tim but those are ancient,” Dean said disappointed. “I thought we were talking like real guns.”</p><p>“These are real guns. I only collect classics. This here dates back to the civil war. And this one before that.”</p><p>Dean didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Instead, he shrugged and picked up the guns. He examined them carefully. They seemed like they would do the job. He placed them back on the bed. Dean eyed Tim, and the pristine condition of his bedroom. He noticed a bookshelf was lined with astronomy textbooks.</p><p>“You seem like a smart kid,” Dean observed. “Why are you selling guns?”</p><p>Tim shrugged. “These are antiques man. I do a lot of research to find good hardware. You won’t need anything else but what you have in your hands.”</p><p>Dean reached crouched down and pulled up his jeans, pulling a wad of cash from his sock, along with a credit card. He counted out several notes, shoved the rest back into his sock, then handed the kid the cash and the credit card.</p><p>“Take this. It’s hot, but basically untraceable. I think it’s some big agent in Hollywood. Never checks his bills, so feel free to have fun.” He inclined his head toward the textbooks. “Get yourself something worthwhile.”</p><p>“Thanks, man,” Tim said, counting the money quickly and easily. He squinted at the credit card. “You can take this too.” He pulled out a small pistol. “I don’t know how much salt my Grams has in the kitchen, but you can just take what you need.”</p><p>Dean nodded his thanks, loaded the guns into his pockets and waistband. He then followed the boy into the kitchen where he loaded up on table salt.</p><p>Outside Dean offered up his hand to Tim.</p><p>“Thanks—you’ve really helped me out.”</p><p>“No problem. Hey—what you need the steel for?”</p><p>Dean eyed the group of young kids in baggie shorts and big T-shirts. Suddenly they all looked much younger and more vulnerable than they had first appeared. One thing about chasing monsters—makes your average human gang member seem like a pussycat.</p><p>“Basically, I think my girlfriend and her kid have been taken by some real bad bitches,” he replied. “And I think it’s all going to go down somewhere around here.”</p><p>“No shit. Well you know where to find us,” Tim said. “We just chillin’, so if you need extra bodies—“</p><p>Dean nodded in appreciation, then got back into the car and pulled around the corner to the Kirkbride Estates. He sat in the car for a short while, checking his weapons and loading them up. Then he got out and walked around the building.</p><p>He spied the parking garage and headed down the ramp. Under the strip lighting, Dean spread out the maps he had taken from the library on the hood of a car. He noticed that the development plans outlined the destruction of a large building in the center of the property, in its place a large swimming pool had been dug. But Dean noticed on the older map of Salem Village the very same space once was a fort built for raids against the Indians. The fort’s outer walls were much larger than the outline of the asylum building or the pool. Dean wondered if the fort somehow still existed.</p><p>A loud thump and muffled voices echoed through the parking structure. Sensing trouble, Dean searched the half-empty garage and noticed the steel doors on the other side of the lot. He grabbed the maps, shoving them back inside his jacket, took out the pistol and silently slipped past rows of cars to the doors. Inside he could hear muffled voices.</p><p>Dean pushed the steel door open an inch. He stuck the pistol barrel through the opening. The next thing he knew the door was swung open and the butt of a gun cracked his nose with a THWACK! Stars exploded in his eyes and Dean fell onto the cement floor.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-seven">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and Samuel looked at Dean passed out at their feet.</p><p>“Now what are we supposed to do?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“Lisa and Ben are in there somewhere,” Sam said.</p><p>“We can’t waltz in there and save them—they’ll shit their pants,” Samuel pointed out.</p><p>“I can’t. But you can. They don’t know who you are.”</p><p>“Sam, I don’t think you understand the gravity of the issue here. There are—I don’t know how many witches in there, one man can’t do anything. I don’t even know what Dean was thinking. He’d get skinned alive. You can’t let him go in alone.”</p><p>Sam looked down at his older brother. Blood trickled from his nose onto the cement.</p><p>“We can’t leave him here,” Samuel went on. “They’ll find him. We need to wake him up.”</p><p>Two minutes later they had opened up a BMW, hot-wired the engine and placed Dean in the front seat. They set all the air conditioning vents toward his face, and blasted the cold air at him. Sam poured a bottle of water over Dean’s head.</p><p>They then retreated back through the steel doors and opened the second door on the other side of the hallway, stepping into a musty-smelling tunnel with a packed dirt floor, and brick archways that reached across the low ceiling. Stale air washed over them from the dark depths further down the tunnel. Samuel pulled a flashlight from his jacket and Sam led with his gun. As they moved forward, the tunnel seemed to drop downhill, deep into the earth. Sam estimated that they were directly underneath the large brick building. He looked at his cell phone, there was absolutely no reception.</p><p>They crept forward in the darkness, until around a corner the tunnel opened up into a large underground cavern. Lamps hung from the ceiling and a crowd of witches was gathered in the middle of the space. They all moved with purpose as though each had been assigned a task. They seemed to be constructing something.</p><p>Aware of their exposed position, Sam looked round for a better hiding place. He noticed a narrow passageway built into the thick walls that seemed to cut through toward the main cavern. It looked like the vestiges of another old passageway system. Sam and Samuel squeezed through the narrow gap. They shuffled down the tunnel until they came to a small opening cut into the wall which allowed them to see into the large cavern.</p><p>“I don’t see Lisa or Ben,” Samuel whispered.</p><p>Sam didn’t respond, because he had spotted Prudence. She stood slightly apart from the rest of the witches, who witches were gathered in a circle. A tall woman stood on a platform. She was chanting from a small book.</p><p>“That’s it,” Samuel said. “That’s the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> We can’t let her get through the entire spell.”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer.</p><p>“Sam, are you listening?” Samuel hissed.</p><p>Sam glared his grandfather.</p><p>“Yes, I get it. We can’t let them finish.”</p><p>Sam stared at the book in the tall witch’s hands. What he couldn’t tell his grandfather was that he didn’t care. If Lucifer took back control over his body in some ways he would welcome it. When Lucifer was in him, for the couple days before he fell into the pit, Sam had never felt so powerful. Lucifer was so strong that being filled up by him completely obliterated any need to care about or love anything. The feeling of literally being able to rule the world was exquisite. Addictive. No other human being on earth had ever felt what Sam had.</p><p>For that reason, in some ways, he would welcome that feeling again. Being squished into a dirt-packed hole underground with his cranky once-dead grandfather, waiting for his heartbroken and desperate brother to come and stop a bunch of witches from resurrecting Lucifer... wasn’t one of Sam’s favorite moments.</p><p>Dean awoke wet and cold with his head pounding. He opened his eyes and clocked the unfamiliar dash of an unfamiliar car. There was a knock on the window. Dean turned and looked into the face of an extremely angry-looking man clutching a computer case and a suit jacket.</p><p>“Hey you, junkie. Get the hell out of my car,” the man yelled. He wrenched open the door and pulled Dean out of his seat by his collar.</p><p>Dean stumbled and fell into the vehicle in the adjacent space.</p><p>“I don’t know why management doesn’t take care of the trash like you,” the guy spat. He got into the driver’s seat and slammed his door, then screeched out of the parking lot.</p><p>Dean noticed his reflection in the dark window of the mini van he was leaning against. His bruised nose was developing a hideous purplish welt. He had no idea what had happened, but since he was still alive, Dean thought it best to move forward. He checked his guns, they were all still there, still working.</p><p>This time, he was slightly more cautious as he pushed open the steel doors. Inside, several cars were parked. Dean instantly recognized Perry’s. He made sure that no one else was hiding in the room, then he passed through the opposite door and into a damp underground tunnel.</p><p>The tunnel was dangerous, there was nowhere to hide if anyone approached from behind or in front of him. Only the darkness would obscure him. In the distance he could hear the murmuring of voices. Dean crept forward down the sloping dark tunnel.</p><p>After what felt like the length of two football fields, the tunnel turned a corner and Dean smelled smoke and found himself looking into a deep cavern and a crowd of witches all chanting in unison.</p><p>The figures, all clad in black, encircled a large bonfire. He could see Connie standing on a platform. She was leading the chant from the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> Perry stood to the side. <span class="italic">She must have fobbed off the cops and then come straight here,</span> he figured. Lisa and Ben must be somewhere nearby though he couldn’t see them.</p><p>The bonfire smoke curled up toward the vaulted stone ceiling. Dean estimated the ceiling was about two stories tall but who knew how far underground they were. It would be pretty impossible to mount a large-scale attack from above. Plus, Dean was pretty sure they were almost directly underneath the large community pool.</p><p>He looked around the hallway, which was built large enough for a horse cart. Dean had an idea and ran back up the tunnel.</p><p>Inside the smoky cavern Lisa and Ben were shackled to the stone wall. Ben whimpered in fear. Lisa tried to soothe her son, but she could only move her hands enough to touch the tips of Ben’s sweaty fingers.</p><p>“Shush, Ben. It’s going to be okay,” Lisa whispered.</p><p>“I never should have gotten that second helping of fries. Perry is evil.”</p><p>“This isn’t your fault, Ben. None of this is your fault. We’re going to find a way out of this. I promise.”</p><p>“How? Where’s Dean?” Ben demanded.</p><p>“He’s coming, honey. He’s coming,” Lisa said, hoping that she was right.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean retreated back to the low-ceilinged hallway where Perry’s car was parked. He opened up the back of the car and was relieved to find his duffle. He got out his two sawed-offs, made sure they had real bullets in them and then opened up the steel doors leading back into the parking lot. He hopped into the driver’s seat of Perry’s car, swiftly got the engine going and backed the Escalade into the parking lot. He laid the condo development plans on the seat beside him, tracing the route until he found the building he was looking for.</p><p>His headache was receding and he felt a new burst of energy now that he had a plan. Dean accelerated out of the parking lot and headed to the maintenance building. He maneuvered the Escalade up to the garage doors. Inside he found entire barrels of fertilizer, gas and other chemicals—all the gear the maintenance crew needed to keep up the grounds, stacked right up to the ceiling.</p><p>Thanking God it wasn’t kill-the-weeds day so the place was deserted, Dean hastened to load the large cans of gas and sacks of fertilizer into the back of the car. Then he swung the car back around and retreated with his bounty back to the parking garage.</p><p>Dean drove through the first set of steel doors and then opened up the second set of doors leading to the underground tunnel. Hoping his estimations were correct, he flicked on his headlights, gunned the engine and floored it through the doors.</p><p>The tires hit the dirt floor of the tunnel and threw the car forward. The tunnel flew by. Dean steeled himself for the turn—the dirt walls didn’t afford him any room for mistakes. Mere seconds flew by. Dean held his breath then cut the wheel.</p><p>The back wheels fishtailed, and then bumped the truck forward. Dean gripped the steering wheel, punched the accelerator and bombed into the cavern and straight into the crowd of witches.</p><p>He stamped on the brakes before he drove into the bonfire. A cacophony of screaming witches shook the cavern. Dean pulled himself out through the sunroof and stood on top of the car. He started shooting.</p><p>The women flew at the car, old and young alike they attacked, lips peeled back as they snarled angrily. Dean blew away body after body.</p><p>Constance had stopped chanting and stood on her platform scowling. Three of her burly farm hands approached the car, Dean got one shot off before they grabbed him by the foot and pulled him off the roof. The six-foot drop landed him on his back.</p><p>Constance stepped off her platform and walked over to Dean. She towered over him.</p><p>“I’m not into this whole two girls one cup angle, could you maybe move?” Dean said.</p><p>Constance kicked him in the ribs. Dean rolled over and blood dribbled out of his mouth.</p><p>“I don’t find you funny,” she said. “But I’m delighted you’re here. It is very appropriate that a descendant of those who ruined my quest the first time, will be sacrificed when I succeed this time.”</p><p>Dean struggled onto all fours, spitting blood, and looked up at Constance.</p><p>“I don’t know what kind of junk you’ve been smoking,” he croaked, “but raising Lucifer is just about the worst idea I’ve ever heard. Trust me.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for your opinion. All I need is your blood. Tie him up with the others,” Constance instructed.</p><p>The burly guys dragged Dean by the feet into a corner where he saw to his relief that Lisa and Ben were shackled. They might be prisoners but they were still alive and apparently unhurt.</p><p>Lisa glared at Dean.</p><p>“This was your idea of a rescue?” Lisa said. “To drive into a cave full of witches without any backup?”</p><p>“I didn’t have much of choice, Lisa. Sort of light on brothers to back me up. It’s not like I can go out and hire anyone to help,” Dean replied.</p><p>The burly guys finished shackling Dean to the wall, then walked away.</p><p>“It’s fine anyway, I have an idea,” Dean said, trying to sound confident.</p><p>“I’m not feeling so fine,” Lisa said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-eight">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Constance stepped to the edge of the platform and hushed the gathering. She raised her hands up in supplication and began to speak. Her ice-cold voice echoed loud and clear around the walls.</p><p>“To all my sisters, we have waited years. The time is nigh. Our great Princes will rise up and under our power create the world in their image. Darkness will reign. No longer will we have to live in the shadows. Sisters, since we came to this land we have suffered and cowered in the corners. Never gaining the respect or the resplendence we are due. After three hundred years the alignment is clear. Sixty-six seals were broken and though the Prince of the South was returned to the underworld—his resurrection is imminent. We will finally have the dark power to create a New World in which we can live freely without the reigns of the light and the Godly. As we go forth, spread the darkness before you like seeds, dear sisters. We are the chosen queens of darkness. The power is ours for the taking. We are the spouses of the Four Princes, and they will do our bidding and build the world of dark, crushing the light. Bring forth the first sacrifice.”</p><p>A scream echoed through the cavern. A young girl, presumably the one from the Amber alert Dean had heard on the trucker’s radio, was dragged up to the platform. Constance began her chant one again. With one hand she brought out a long knife, with the other she held the neck of the girl over a large brass bowl.</p><p>“Close your eyes, Ben,” Dean said. “Now.”</p><p>Ben squeezed his eyes shut. The girl continued to scream.</p><p>The rest of the witches joined in the chanting, louder this time, their voices echoed off the walls so the noise was unbearable.</p><p>Dean tried to move closer to Ben as the boy started to visibly shake with fear. Dean looked at Lisa and saw her eyes were full of tears. The guilt squeezed his chest—how could he have let this happen?</p><p>Constance shouted over the chanting and the girl’s hysterical screams.</p><p>“We call forth the Four Princes of the Darkness. The rulers of Hell, the sons of darkness. Rise up from your unearthly shackles. We call forth and command you to rise. We call all the forces of darkness to rise. To the prince of the North, Belial, I command you to rise. I invoke thee. I summon thee. I conjure thee. With this life blood, manifest thyself. With this sacrifice, manifest thyself. Come forth, Belial. Come forth, Belial.”</p><p>The girl fought like a young goat, but Constance held her firmly by the nape of the neck and in one deft cut she slit the girl’s throat from side to side. Lisa whimpered and buried her head in her chest.</p><p>Constance held the dead girl’s hair, the body plunged forward and blood poured from the gaping neck wound into the bowl. A dark-red drop splashed up across the lip.</p><p>Constance started to shout.</p><p>“Belial, I call you forth. I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth.”</p><p>There was a rumble from all sides of the cavern. Small pebbles shook loose from the ceiling.</p><p>“What’s happening, Dean? What did she mean by the princes of darkness? Is that Lucifer?” Lisa whispered.</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Is that why we’re here? Were you going to try and do this? Raise Lucifer to get Sam back?” Lisa’s eyes were wide with fear and disbelief.</p><p>“It crossed my mind,” Dean admitted.</p><p>“Are you crazy? I know you miss Sam, but were you really prepared to do <span class="italic">this</span>?”</p><p>“I had no idea it meant sacrificing people—I would never do that. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Lisa turned her head away from him.</p><p>“I don’t know anything anymore, Dean. I’m so scared I can’t think.”</p><p>Another great groan emanated from the ground. Belial was slowly rising up. They needed to get out of there.</p><p>“Trust me, please, baby. It’s going to be fine. I’ll get us out of here—I promise,” Dean said.</p><p>Just then two of the burly guys walked over. One grabbed Lisa by the waist and pulled her up, as the second struggled to unlock the ancient iron shackles that held her feet and ankles. Lisa started screaming, she kicked her legs and struggled to escape.</p><p>“Mum!” Ben called as he tried to pull free of his bonds.</p><p>“Leave her alone,” Dean growled at the men. “Take me instead.” But the guys ignored him.</p><p>Lisa spat and fought, she pulled her leg back and managed to kick one of the guys in the nuts. The guy doubled over. Neither of the attackers noticed as a small key dropped to the dusty cavern floor. The guys pulled Lisa away.</p><p>Dean looked at the key and looked at Ben. The boy’s eyes were full of terror but he wasn’t hysterical. He understood Dean’s meaning straight away and placed his sneaker over the key.</p><p>“Can you get it over to me?” Dean whispered.</p><p>Ben steadily wrapped his sneakers around the small object and pushed it toward Dean’s hands. Dean felt the tip of Ben’s sneakers, then the cool metal of the key. He pulled one hand through the shackles as much as he could, then twisted his hand with the key into the keyhole of the opposite shackle. The iron clap unlatched with a soft click. Dean threw a glance in the direction the men had taken Lisa, he saw she was still fighting. Dean undid the other shackle, then his feet. No one was looking at them—all eyes were on Constance.</p><p>Dean shuffled over until he was beside Ben. He quickly undid the boy’s shackles. Dean looked around—how was he going to get them out of here unharmed? In the corner Dean spotted a nasty, ripped old dress. Dean crawled over to it and brought it back to Ben.</p><p>“Put this on. Quickly,” Dean directed.</p><p>“I don’t want to put on a dress,” Ben said.</p><p>“Just put it on,” Dean insisted, eyes flicking back and forth to make sure no one was looking at them. Ben pulled the dress on over his T-shirt. “Put this on, too.” Dean handed him a bonnet he had also retrieved. Ben begrudgingly put on the bonnet.</p><p>They stood up slowly and carefully, Dean’s gaze taking in the whole room. But the commotion in the center of the cavern was drawing everyone’s attention and they began to move slowly and silently toward the corridor.</p><p>“Hold my hands like they’re still shackled,” Dean murmured. “When we get near the opening, let me go and then I need you to do something for me.”</p><p>“What about Mom?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Don’t worry—I’ll take care of her,” Dean replied.</p><p>The chanting continued. In the center of the bonfire the earth below had started to give way again.</p><p>Dean saw that Lisa was being forced onto Constance’s podium. He didn’t have much time. He eyed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> at the tall witch’s side. She was still giving directions to her underlings.</p><p>Dean whispered instructions to Ben, still dressed in the filthy dress and bonnet. If you weren’t looking carefully, he could have been one of the witches. Dean waited a moment.</p><p>“Okay, now,” he said.</p><p>Ben let go of Dean, and walked toward the podium. His hand shook as he reached out and grabbed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> that lay near the dead young girl’s head. He flinched at her dead eyes, that were looking upwards right at him.</p><p>“You girl, bring me that book,” Constance said spinning around to face Ben. “Don’t dawdle, give me that book.”</p><p>Ben grabbed the book and approached her.</p><p>“Give it here,” Constance directed. Ben stepped toward her, but misjudged the uneven dirt floor, he tripped landing on all fours. “Oh you stupid child, can’t seem to resurrect a competent witch these days,” Constance said.</p><p>Ben struggled to get up. He rearranged his “skirts” then drew himself up before Constance. He held out the book for her. She grabbed it and stuck it under her arm. Then she directed the two burly men to bring Lisa to her. Ben swung around on his heel and walked in the direction of the door. The Escalade still stood inside the entrance. As Ben walked past Dean he handed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> to him.</p><p>“Good job, now get out of here,” Dean whispered.</p><p>Ben nodded and walked into tunnel. The darkness swallowed him.</p><p>He made it five feet into the tunnel when two young girls appeared out of the darkness.</p><p>“Where are you going, girl?” one of them asked.</p><p>Ben hid his head and shrugged.</p><p>“These old witches are weird. Do they even speak English?” the other one said.</p><p>“I don’t know,” the first one replied. “But she shouldn’t be leaving. Keep her here. I’ll go ask.” The first girl walked into the cavern, the other watched her.</p><p>Ben was about to flee, when someone grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>Ben struggled against his abductor until the guy turned him around and gestured for him to be quiet. He had pulled him into the side tunnel off the main corridor. Ben couldn’t see much but he could tell this guy was old, bald, and definitely not a witch.</p><p>“I’m going to get you out of here,” the man hissed. “Follow me.”</p><p>Not having an alternative, Ben did as he was told and followed the old guy. They ran up a long, dark tunnel, through two sets of doors and out into a parking structure.</p><p>There they paused to catch their breath. Then the old guy bent down and spoke to Ben.</p><p>“I want you to go back above ground. And no matter what you do, do not come down here again. You understand me?”</p><p>Ben nodded. “Who are you?”</p><p>“Friend of Dean’s. Now go,” the man said sternly. Ben wasn’t going to be told twice. He ran up the ramp and out of the parking garage to the lawn outside. There he plopped down on the grass, still trying to catch his breath. He looked down at his improvised disguise and then quickly tore off his dress and bonnet.</p><p>“What the hell are you?” a voice said.</p><p>Ben swiveled round. A gang of boys stepped forward and encircled Ben. They were much bigger than Ben, and though he’d been bullied a couple times on the playground, Ben knew he was being confronted by a group with a lot more street cred.</p><p>“We haven’t seen you around here before. You know you gotta ask permission before coming outside, right.” one of them said.</p><p>In the last six hours Ben’s skin had grown a tad thicker than it had been before.</p><p>“Dude, leave me alone. There’s some shit going down and I really don’t need your crap too.”</p><p>“Hey, you know some white guy, Dean, came here looking for trouble round here?” an older kid said, stepping forward.</p><p>“Yeah, Dean’s my mom’s boyfriend. He’s down there,” Ben said pointing to the parking garage.</p><p>“Where? Down in that locked cavern shit?” another kid said.</p><p>Ben nodded. “These real bad witches have my mom. I don’t know how Dean’s gonna stop them. Some old bald guy just took me up here and told me to stay. I think he went back in there.”</p><p>The older kid held up his hand. He was clearly the leader.</p><p>“What do you mean witches, little man? Like Halloween witches? You trippin’?”</p><p>Ben shook his head emphatically.</p><p>“No, I mean <span class="italic">real witches.</span> Like want to bring the dark days upon this whole town, upon this whole world kind of witches. Believe me, there isn’t going to be any candy given out.”</p><p>“Well, I’m up for a little beat down. If that white dude is down there, we’re going to go help him. Tiny get some steel up in here,” the kid said.</p><p>“Sure thing, Tim.” Tiny, who was anything but, popped open the back trunk of a Caddy. Inside was an impressive weapons cache. Ben got up and stepped toward the trunk.</p><p>“Back away, little man. This is our fight now. No freaks are going to take over our homes,” the older kid said.</p><p>They all grabbed street weaponry and disappeared down the ramp and into the parking garage.</p><p>Ben sat on the bumper of the car and said a little prayer that Dean and his mother would reappear soon. This vacation really sucked.</p><p>Samuel and Sam crouched at the cavern entrance; they were taking potshots at any witches trying to leave the cave.</p><p>They heard a noise behind them, and turned to see a group of boys were approaching through the tunnel. Samuel stood up to meet them.</p><p>“Be careful in there boys,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Why aren’t you in there, old man?” the oldest-looking kid asked.</p><p>“Believe me, I’m doing my part,” Samuel said as he pointed his gun at a runaway resurrected hag and pulled the trigger. Her dusty head slit in two and she dropped at the boys’ feet.</p><p>“Good enough,” the kid said.</p><p>Crouched in the shadows, Dean thumbed quickly through the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> He found the spell Thomas had described in the journal that Nathaniel had used to send Belial back to Hell. Dean realized he had one small problem; he didn’t have anyone to sacrifice—except himself.</p><p>He was going to have to rethink this—but fast. Very fast. Constance was hushing the chanting crowd of witches. She had pulled Lisa up on the platform. In the center of the cavern, the earth started to move around in a circle. The fire squelched as a blast of heat poured from the hole opening up in the center of the room. Belial was rising.</p><p>Constance started to chant again. Dean saw a shadowy figure lunge forward in the darkness.</p><p>Then he saw them. The kid who had sold him the guns and his gang ran into the cavern, guns blazing. They started shooting.</p><p>Enraged, Constance released Lisa and leapt off the podium. Dean was relieved to see Lisa still had the presence of mind to seize an opportunity, as she too jumped off the podium and retreated into the corridor, back toward safety.</p><p>Dean ran toward the group.</p><p>“Dude, arm me!” he yelled at Tim.</p><p>Tim swiveled around and threw Dean a sawed-off.</p><p>“Now this is more like it,” Dean muttered. He turned around and started blasting at encroaching witches. He climbed back up onto the Escalade and started shooting at the center of the writhing fiery pit.</p><p>“This is some shit,” Tim called.</p><p>“All in a day’s work,” Dean yelled back.</p><p>The gang members had some great hunting skills. One old witch flew at Tiny, who tried to swat her away but was caught offguard by her strength.</p><p>“Die, witch bitch,” Tiny said, pointing his gun at the resurrected creature’s head and blowing her dusty brains out.</p><p>Another kid with a red do-rag ran into the center of the cavern.</p><p>“Don’t!” Dean yelled. But it was too late, the kid jumped over the ring of fire and landed in the center of the resurrection. The ground gave way and a blast of fire spit up as the kid slid into the pit.</p><p>Tiny steeled himself as another witch jumped on his back.</p><p>“Duck!” Dean yelled.</p><p>Tiny ducked down, leaving an open shot for Dean. He blasted the witch.</p><p>“They’re weakened by all their energy going toward the resurrection,” Dean explained. “Just keep blowing them away.”</p><p>Constance flew at Dean and toppled him off the car, knocking the breath out him. The tall witch knelt on top of him and held the knife to his neck.</p><p>“When are you Campbells going to stop causing problems for me?” she hissed. “I’m getting pretty sick of it.”</p><p>“Get sick of this bitch,” Tim said, shoving his gun into her head. But Constance was too quick; she spun off of Dean and swiped at Tim with the knife. A crimson ribbon of blood appeared across his chest. The boy looked down in surprise, and ineffectually put his hand to his chest. A little bubble of blood spit out his lips.</p><p>“No!” Dean rushed to Tim’s side. “We’ll get you out of here.”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Too late, man, too late. I ain’t going to make it. Just use me, okay?”</p><p>Dean looked into the kid’s eyes and nodded. He knew what he was saying.</p><p>“Take care of my Gram.” The life was quickly draining out of him.</p><p>At that moment the rumbling became more intense. From the center of the cavern a geyser of fire shot up from the floor, the figure of Belial—half-goat, half-man—appeared from the earth. Though surrounded by fire, the figure was darker than dark. It turned toward Constance in a shower of brimstone.</p><p>“I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth,” she cried.</p><p>“Belial is yours to obey. You have unchained the first Prince of Hell.” Belial’s voice shuddered over the cavern.</p><p>“Do it. Do it now,” Tim whispered to Dean.</p><p>Dean pulled out the <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> and started reading out loud.</p><p>“Oh god of dark and god of light. You are summoned no more. Hide your evilness in the cage from which you came, you are not wanted on this mortal plain. I forbade <span class="italic">vos of atrum pergo huic regnum. Vos es inconcessus ut ingredior inter lux lucis. Vos es inconcessus ut futurus in is terra. Vado tergum qua vos venit. Vado tergum ut vestri cage. Vos es non volo. Per vox of lux lucis quod filiolus of Olympus quod bonus verto tergum ut atrum.”</span></p><p>Belial swung his mighty head and the enormous blackness headed toward Dean, but Dean continued, struggling to keep his voice steady.</p><p>“You are not needed in this world. Go back from which you came. Take this sacrifice and be gone.”</p><p>With that Dean sliced Tim’s throat and the blood spurt from his neck over Dean’s hands. It dripped onto the dirt floor, seeping into the dust. Belial gave a great roar. He moved toward Dean, and as he passed through the ring of fire, he transformed. Suddenly standing in front of Dean was the figure of John Winchester.</p><p>But the figure’s voice wasn’t his father’s; it belonged to something dark and unearthly.</p><p>“Dean, why have you forsaken your father? Why not create Hell on Earth, and then your family can be together again?” it said.</p><p>Dean turned his head away and repeated the last sentence of the incantation.</p><p><span class="italic">“Non opus in hoc mundo. Revertere unde veneris. Accipe sacrificium et recedemus.”</span></p><p>Belial bent down and shot his hand out, grabbing Dean’s chin. He pulled him toward the fire.</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten you, Dean. We’re still waiting for you to come back.”</p><p>With that he let go of Dean and stepped back into the fire and disappeared. The brimstone died down into embers, the earth closed back up and the ground re-coagulated into solid earth.</p><p>Constance screamed in anger. She wielded her knife and sliced off the closest young witch’s head in one motion.</p><p>“You won’t get away with this!” Constance yelled to Dean. She flipped open the book in her hands. “What is this? This isn’t my book. What is this Winchester journal?” She threw the book onto the ground. Dean smiled. He hadn’t taught Ben much, but he had picked up some neat slight of hand.</p><p>Dean felt someone grab his hair and jerk his head back.</p><p>“You made her mad,” Prudence said. “And you’ve really disappointed me, Dean. Why are you always screwing things up for me?” With a powerful swing she threw Dean across the cavern. He hit the rock walls and slid onto the ground.</p><p><span class="italic">I’m getting really tired of being thrown around like this,</span> Dean thought.</p><p>Prudence stepped over the dying fire and marched toward him. Dean shook the cobwebs from his head. He was still holding the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> He flipped to another page and started reading.</p><p>“God of darkness, God of light bring forth the witness this one night. Those that have died at the hands of the undone. Bring them forth for them to shun those that have trespassed against the good and innocent. Bring them forth for the world to once again gain equilibrium.”</p><p>Prudence stopped in her tracks.</p><p>“You wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I just did,” Dean said. “I think some people have a score to settle.”</p><p>Dean pulled a canister of salt out of his jacket and poured a ring around him. Prudence raced forward, but he closed the circle before she could reach him. Dean smiled and pointed behind her. Prudence swung around.</p><p>The witches stood still as the spirits of the long-dead residents of Salem Village appeared. Bridget Bishop, the first to be hanged, approached Prudence.</p><p>“I remember you. You sent me to hang. I was innocent, yet you used your cunning and wit and let me hang.”</p><p>“You slit my throat,” a young voice said. Prudence spun again and came face to face with Abigail Faulkner. “I trusted you. I did everything you said, and how was I repaid? I became your first sacrifice.”</p><p>Prudence shrugged. “Come now, Abby. I was only doing what I was told. It was Constance who picked you to sacrifice.”</p><p>Abigail shook her head.</p><p>“No, it was you.” Abigail shot her hand through Prudence’s chest. Prudence tried to struggle, but her strength had already been drained by the resurrections. “I could have lived a long and happy life. I should have. Well, now we’ll make sure you’re shown the same justice as you showed the innocent people of Salem.”</p><p>Abigail thrust her hand deeper and Prudence’s skin began to lose its healthy pallor. Her eyes grayed over, her skin cracked and flaked. Abigail continued to hold Prudence until her body fell into a thousand dusty pieces at her feet.</p><p>Abigail looked at the walnut-sized shriveled heart in her hand, and she let it drop to the ground. She then looked at Dean and the ring of salt around his feet.</p><p>“I don’t remember you,” she said.</p><p>“I’m just here to observe. It’s your fight now,” Dean replied.</p><p>Abigail nodded, turned and sped toward Constance. The tall, fearsome witch was hissing and spitting as she fought off a dozen angry Salem ghosts all at once.</p><p>“Get off me you fleabags. You were worthless bags of skin in life and now you’re worthless specks of dust. Get off me!” she screamed.</p><p>Bridget Bishop jumped onto Constance’s back. She reached over and thrust her hand into her chest. Constance thrashed and fought, but the angry spirit held on. Other ghosts piled on top of her, until Dean couldn’t even see the witch beneath layers of ghostly flesh.</p><p>Finally, one last scream of agony and anger echoed through the cavern as Constance suddenly aged to her three-hundred-and-fifty years, and crumpled into dirt.</p><p>The cavern was suddenly eerily quiet. With their leader gone, the few witches that remained evaporated.</p><p>The gang members surveyed the scene and then gathered their weapons and limped back toward the tunnel. Dean looked around the echoing space that was littered with bodies. Some of the resurrected witches had merely turned to piles of dusty clothes. Dean shook his head.</p><p>Abigail approached him once again.</p><p>“Are you a Campbell?” she asked.</p><p>Dean nodded. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>Abigail smiled. “Thank you. Thank Thomas and Caleb for me too.”</p><p>Dean nodded, he didn’t want to correct the poor ghost and tell her they were long gone.</p><p>Their work done, Abigail and the other ghosts of Salem disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Dean stepped out of the salt circle. He searched the ground for John’s journal and finding it, tucked it safely back into his jacket. Tim’s body lay prostrate at Dean’s feet. Dean took his Zippo and tore a little piece of cloth from his shirt. He opened the back door of the Escalade, set the burning piece of fabric in the trunk next to the explosives and shut the door.</p><p>He then crouched down and swung Tim’s body onto his shoulder and started jogging up the tunnel. He knew he didn’t have long to get out.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, the percussive explosions started. Dean ran full force with the kid’s six-foot frame bumping against his. He headed through both sets of doors, swinging them closed behind him and then ran out of the parking structure.</p><p>Dean hauled ass up the parking ramp just as the BMW douche from before was pulling in. Dean stood in front of the car.</p><p>“Don’t go in there man,” he yelled.</p><p>“What are you saying to me?” BMW said. “Is that a dead body?” The guy indicated the figure thrown over Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>“I warned you,” Dean said, moving away and walking onto the grass.</p><p>With that a massive explosion ripped through the parking structure. The BMW blew backwards and Dean was thrown to the ground, Tim’s body crumpled beneath him. He stood up as the rest of the gang appeared and surrounded the body. They ceremonially placed a sheet over it.</p><p>“He was a good kid. A hero,” Dean managed to say.</p><p>The kids nodded.</p><p>“Dean!” Ben shouted, running toward him. Lisa followed and they both hugged Dean. “You made it,” Ben said. “I knew you would. The old guy did too.”</p><p>“What old guy?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Your friend. The bald old guy,” Ben said hugging him.</p><p>Dean looked at Lisa who shrugged.</p><p>“That was some nice hand work, Ben,” Dean said, referring to the switch Ben pulled on the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and the journal.</p><p>“Thanks,” Ben said. “But next vacation I think I’m going to stay home.”</p><p>“Me too,” Lisa said with a sad smile.</p><p>“I think I owe you both a real one,” Dean said.</p><p>“Yeah, we’re going to have to talk about that,” Lisa said.</p><p>They started to walk away, then Dean halted.</p><p>“I gotta make one stop first.” He left Ben and Lisa and jogged over across the lawn to the Tim’s grandmother’s house. He rang the doorbell.</p><p>A moment later Tim’s Gram answered the door. She took one look at Dean and seemed to know immediately what had happened.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Dean said. “He was a good kid. There’s some money on his bed.”</p><p>The old lady shook her head.</p><p>“I don’t need no money. I need my grandson alive.”</p><p>“He sacrificed himself for me and my family. He was a real brave kid,” Dean said.</p><p>She nodded, then shut the door on Dean. He walked soberly back to Lisa and Ben and they started to walk down the road. Dean wished once again that he had bought the Impala.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-nine">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Two Weeks Later</p><p>Dean opened his eyes and stared up at the eggshell-colored ceiling. Early morning light filtered through the blinds. The other side of the bed was empty. Lisa must have gotten out of bed without him waking up. Downstairs Lisa had left a note. She was filling in for a yoga class and it was Ben’s first day of school. A slight flutter of guilt filled Dean as he had wanted to be up to say goodbye to Ben, and wish him luck.</p><p>Dean poured himself a cup of lukewarm coffee and sat down on the couch. The house was silent, no kids played outside. He was utterly alone. He had tried to put the events two weeks ago behind him. But no matter how much Dean tried to forget it, he always came back to the realization that he had failed Sam once again. He wasn’t able to resurrect him and the thought of living the rest of his life without him still torn his insides out.</p><p>Dean picked up his phone, he ached for someone, anyone, to call. But who would that be? Bobby would be glad to hear from him, but it wouldn’t be the same. Dean needed his brother back. He sighed. And yet he had made a promise to him. Dean decided to keep it. He pushed himself off the couch, went outside and into the garage. A few seconds later he had the mower out, and was pushing it across the lawn.</p><p>If this was the life Sam wanted him to lead, then he was going to do it. For Sam.</p><p>“Well I can’t say it was a job well done, but you did manage to keep Lucy in his cage, so I guess kudos to you.” Crowley stepped out of the shadows of Samuel’s office.</p><p>Samuel stared up at him, a glass of whiskey in his hand.</p><p>“Dean almost got killed,” Samuel said. “The kid, too.”</p><p>“Ah but he didn’t, old boy. You did your job and now we have to get back to work don’t we? Must keep our eyes on the prize. Your darling Mary.”</p><p>Samuel jumped out of his seat with such force that the chair knocked over and his whiskey glass spun like a top on the table. He was chin to chin with Crowley.</p><p>“Don’t ever say her name again,” Samuel warned.</p><p>“Well since I don’t take to reading the Bible each night, I won’t have much trouble with that. Sit down and get your smelly meat mouth out of my face before I get upset,” Crowley said with an edge.</p><p>Samuel backed off.</p><p>“Now I think you have some monsters to catch.” Crowley flashed a crooked smile.</p><p>“I’m telling you this now,” Samuel said, “as soon as Mary is returned to me, you better watch your Limey ass. Because I’m going to hunt it down and send it back to Hell.”</p><p>“I’ll look forward to that,” Crowley spat. “Very much.”</p><p>And with that the demon disappeared. Samuel picked up his chair and sat back down. There was a knock on the door. Samuel grumbled some sort of acquiesce and Sam entered. He closed the door behind him.</p><p>“Thought you might like to know, there’s a nest of vamps in Oklahoma City. You want to come?” Sam asked.</p><p>Samuel shook his head.</p><p>“You can take care of it without me. You know the drill.”</p><p>Sam nodded. He paused a moment.</p><p>“You okay?” he asked.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Samuel replied, not looking up.</p><p>Sam nodded. “Be back by noon tomorrow.”</p><p>Outside, Sam gave a quick nod to Gwen and Mark, and they headed toward the truck. Sam breathed in the crisp morning air, it felt what he imagined was “good.” He got in the van.</p><p>As they pulled away from the compound, Sam’s mind stayed on the sad look on Samuel’s face. A flicker of sympathy passed over his face, like a quick zap of static from a socket on a dry day. Then as quickly as it came, it was gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-epilogue">CHAPTER EPILOGUE</span><a href="#chapter-epilogue" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Fall 1705</p><p>Caleb and I rode into Philadelphia under the cover of darkness. Though only late September, the weather was unusually cold. Fog pushed in from the river and rolled down Market Street making the cobblestones wet and slick. We had been called to town by one Mrs. Webster Moreland. Her letter, hand-delivered to our inn by a servant boy, had asked that we come immediately.</p><p>She had recently arrived in the town of Philadelphia and had left a sizeable estate up the river in the care of her son, Arthur. It seems that she had become rather frightened of her only son; that he was not himself. Once a gregarious, kind-hearted young man, he now seemed sullen and mean, and was seized by frequent violent outbursts. Not knowing if a disease had taken over her son, Mrs Moreland had fled to her city house.</p><p>Caleb believes she is mad, and has made a bet with me to prove it.</p><p>“This will be a waste of our time,” Caleb said, “you’ll see. She will turn out to be a fussy old hen who is making up stories.”</p><p>I told him we would see for ourselves.</p><p>As it turned out Mrs. Moreland was neither fussy nor an old hen. She was a stocky and sane woman who seemed to have her household in order. Her son was her main concern.</p><p>We arrived at seven, just in time for dinner, and she invited us to join her. Caleb and I looked out of place in our leather coats and canvas trousers at her polished dinner table, piled high with roasts and pies. After a meal that rivaled our Christmas feasts, we sat down to speak about her son. After some discussion, it was decided that Caleb and I would ride up to her estate and survey her son’s behavior.</p><p>It seemed however that Arthur had other plans.</p><p>Arthur arrived at his mother’s brick townhouse, unannounced, just after ten. He seemed surprised that she had visitors, namely two gritty gentlemen like Caleb and myself, but he put on his best face to hide his disgust.</p><p>It was decided that we would spend the night. Caleb and I shared a room which contained two of the largest beds we had ever seen. Arthur slept across the hall. Or so we thought. At around two in the morning we heard him sneak out of his room, creep down the stairs, and then we heard the click of the front door latch. Caleb and I jumped into our boots and followed him.</p><p>The fog hadn’t dissipated any as we followed Arthur down the damp streets. At some point he turned a corner into a darkened alleyway. Not having been in the town of Philadelphia before, Caleb and I were unfamiliar with its streets. Perhaps there was another way around, but we didn’t know for sure, and since we risked losing Arthur’s trail, we followed.</p><p>We made our way after Arthur as quietly as we could. The narrow passage stunk of wharf rats from the nearby piers. Behind a brick house we saw Arthur steal into a recessed basement of some sort. When we were sure he was shut inside, we peered into the street-level windows: inside was full of merry men and women, dancing and drinking. Not so unusual, we thought, he’s just a regular young man out for a night of fun.</p><p>But then from behind us came a sound. We hid behind a couple crates of trash and watched a young man in upper-class finery walk to the same door. He looked in our direction and though I’m sure he couldn’t see us we were caught with a most surprising site. His eyes were black—jet black as the night.</p><p>Dearest sister, father once told us of demons, but we have never encountered them ourselves. We are in need of any and all of the Latin exorcism texts, as well as your expertise.</p><p>We are afraid there is a scourge of demons in Philadelphia. Please come quick.</p><p>Your dearest brother,</p><p>Thomas</p><h2><span id="supernatural">SUPERNATURAL</span><a href="#supernatural" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>features exclusive interviews with Jared and Jensen, guest stars, and the behind-the-scenes crew of the show, the latest news, and classic episode spotlights!

He stood at the edge of the pond, tearing small pieces from a slice of wheat bread and tossing them into the water. A half dozen ducks had gathered close to shore, and whenever a morsel landed close to them, they extended their necks, heads darting fast as striking snakes, and snatched up the snack in their rounded beaks. When the bread was gone, they stared at the humans, eager and alert for the next offering.</p><p>“Not all ducks fly south for the winter,” Joyce said. “As long as it doesn’t get cold enough to damage their feet, they can make it to spring just fine.”</p><p>Ted turned toward her, an amused smile on his face. “I thought you retired from teaching. Besides, you taught English, not biology.”</p><p>She couldn’t help laughing. “Once a know-it-all, always a know-it-all, I suppose.”</p><p>Even in his sixties, Ted Boykin was a good-looking man, with a full head of thick white hair, a trim goatee to match, and the most striking blue eyes. Back when he’d been principal at the school where Joyce had taught, he’d been clean-shaven, and while she was normally indifferent to facial hair on men, the beard gave him a roguish air that she liked. She’d worked alongside the man for more than twenty years, but while she’d respected him, even in some ways counted him as a friend, she hadn’t been attracted to him. But now here they were. Life sure was funny sometimes. In fact, it could be downright hysterical.</p><p>It was dusk in early November, and although it had been on the warm side throughout the day, now that the sun had dipped toward the horizon it was getting cold. Ted seemed comfortable in his brown jacket, but Joyce had donned a blue windbreaker before leaving her apartment, and it didn’t do much to ward off the chill in the air, especially since she wore only a T-shirt beneath. She wished she’d at least thought to grab a hat or scarf before walking out the door.</p><p><em>Why so addle-pated all of a sudden, my dear?</em> she asked herself. <em>Could it be that you were a wee bit nervous to rendezvous with Mr. Boykin down by the duck pond?</em> She wanted to tell herself that it was a ridiculous thought. She was a grown woman, for god’s sake! <em>Over</em>grown, truth be told, if not vertically then at least horizontally. And the pond was hardly lover’s lane. Even so, she had to admit to a certain uneasiness at being there. She’d been alone since her husband had died a few years back, and while she still missed him, in all that time she hadn’t felt the need to seek out a replacement. But then a week ago she’d bumped into Ted—almost literally. She’d been backing her Volvo out of the parking space in front of her apartment at the same moment Ted had been passing in front of her building. He’d barely managed to stop his Bronco in time to avoid ramming her rear end—<em>And isn’t that a phrase rife with naughty possibilities?</em>—and that’s when they’d discovered that after the deaths of their respective spouses, they’d both sold their homes and moved into Arbor Vale Apartments. In fact, Ted lived in the building next to Joyce’s, and had for almost two years, without either of them knowing the other was there. Small world, and all that.</p><p>The next day they’d met for lunch, and the day after that, dinner. They’d seen quite a bit of each other over the past seven days, and in that time, Ted had been a complete gentleman, not trying to kiss her or even hold her hand. She was, quite frankly, getting tired of it. She wished he would go ahead and make a move already. She was far from shy and would have made the first move herself if he hadn’t been so tentative toward her. The last thing she wanted to do was scare him off by being too direct: <em>Don’t you think it’s time the two of us had sex? It’s not like we’re getting any younger.</em> Somehow, she didn’t think that would work.</p><p>She brushed her black hair over her ear, even though there was no need. The air was still, and as short as she kept her hair, it rarely got mussed. Since childhood, she’d been something of a tomboy, and now that she no longer had to dress for work, that tendency had reasserted itself. She preferred simple clothes like T-shirts and jeans and wore no makeup. She’d recently taken to collecting jewelry that she picked up at auctions and estate sales, for reasons she couldn’t articulate clearly even to herself, but she rarely wore any of it. She wished she’d put some on today, though. Maybe if she seemed more feminine to Ted, he wouldn’t keep her at arm’s length. <em>Maybe he hasn’t gotten over the loss of his wife yet,</em> she thought. <em>Or maybe he still sees me as one of his teachers instead of a woman.</em> She was surprised by how much this latter possibility depressed her.</p><p>The pond lay behind Arbor Vale’s buildings, at the bottom of a gently sloping grassy hill. On the other side were woods of oak, elm, and ash trees, their leaves a splendorous mix of yellows, reds, and browns. Most of them hadn’t fallen yet, but Joyce knew it wouldn’t be much longer before they began drifting to the ground. A week, maybe two. Autumn was her favorite time of the year, partly because it was when school began, but mostly because of the energy that filled the crisp air. It was a delicious paradox that even as the world prepared for the temporary death brought by winter—to be followed by resurrection come spring—it seemed, at least to her, to be the most alive.</p><p><em>To hell with it,</em> she thought. <em>Life is for living.</em> She took a step closer to Ted, reached out, and took his hand.</p><p>She felt him tense and feared he would pull away, but then he relaxed and clasped her hand firmly. Joyce didn’t look at him, and he didn’t look at her, but they both smiled and gazed at the water. Ted tossed in the last of the bread, and once it was gone, the ducks milled about, hoping for more, but doomed to disappointment. Joyce admired the way the reflections of the trees on the opposite shore rippled on the water like shadowy ink.</p><p>She was wondering what the chances were of Ted kissing her later, and perhaps doing more than just kissing, when she heard a low growling sound. Fear jolted her, and she tightened her grip on Ted’s hand.</p><p>The ducks let out a series of alarmed quacks as they reared back, spread their wings, and one by one took to the sky, flapping with frantic urgency as they fled.</p><p>The sound came again, a deep rumbling like a truck engine in dire need of repair, only it was louder this time. And closer. The sound came from their right, and when Joyce and Ted turned in that direction, they saw a large dark shape emerge from the woods and come toward them, walking on all fours.</p><p>It moved with the slow, menacing deliberation of a predator, and at first Joyce thought it might be a coyote. In recent years, the animals had moved into Ohio, and while they were by no means common, there were more of them around than most people thought. Joyce had never seen one outside of TV and the zoo—not alive, anyway. The animals were masters of concealment that preferred to avoid humans whenever possible, and the only time she’d seen one was when it lay dead on the side of the highway after being struck by a vehicle. She had been surprised by how much larger it looked than she expected. Ohio coyotes had shaggier coats than their desert-dwelling cousins, which likely accounted for the seeming disparity in their sizes. But Joyce quickly discarded the possibility that this creature was a coyote. There was something wrong about it. The gloom of dusk cloaked it, rendering it a mobile shadow that moved with a lurching, uneven gait, as if it were injured. Its growls weren’t sounds of pain, though, but rather of hunger combined with almost human anger. Could it be a wolf? As far as Joyce knew, no wolves lived in Ohio, at least not in the wild. Maybe this one had been someone’s pet that had escaped or been turned loose for some reason. Yet its form lacked the feral grace of a wolf, and seemed more canine than lupine.</p><p>Then the smell hit her, a thick miasma of musk and rot that made her gorge rise.</p><p><em>Sweet Jesus, what</em> was <em>that thing?</em></p><p>“It’s okay,” Ted said. His voice was shaky, but he didn’t hesitate as he let go of Joyce’s hand and stepped between her and the approaching whatever-it-was. Normally, she would have hated having a man—any man—treat her as if she were some delicate thing that needed protecting, but something about this... this <em>creature</em> triggered a deep atavistic fear in her, and she was grateful for Ted’s gesture. She thought, too, that perhaps his actions were as much for his benefit as hers. As a former principal, he was used to being in charge and dealing with problems head on. It was his default setting, a comfortable role that he could fall back on in a time of crisis.</p><p>Still, as much as she appreciated what he was trying to do, her instincts told her it was a bad idea. <em>Very</em> bad.</p><p>She put her hand on his shoulder. “Please, don’t.”</p><p>Ted gave no sign that he heard her. Instead, he took a step toward the creature and drew himself up to his full height, arms held away from his sides, hands balled into fists.</p><p><em>He’s trying to make himself look larger,</em> Joyce realized. <em>More threatening.</em> She wondered if he’d done something similar in high school when dealing with potentially violent teenage boys. But hadn’t she read somewhere that directly facing a canine and making eye contact was a form of challenge to them? In that case—</p><p>The creature rushed forward, mismatched limbs moving with surprising speed, growl so loud it was nearly a roar. It moved so swiftly that in the dimming light of dusk Joyce could only make out the most basic details of its grotesque form: different-sized legs, a single ragged ear, bare skin alternating with patches of fur, and worst of all, a crooked muzzle filled with sharp teeth, far more than the mouth of a simple dog should have been able to hold.</p><p>When it was within a yard of Ted, the beast leaped into the air, discolored tongue lolling from the side of its misshapen mouth. Its front paws hit Ted on the chest, its weight driving him backward, slamming him against the ground. The impact drove the air from his lungs, and she heard a crack that she guessed was the sound of one or more ribs breaking.</p><p>Joyce had managed to sidestep in time to avoid being knocked down, and she now stood less than a foot away from Ted as he struggled with the freakish dog, which was roughly the size and bulk of a St. Bernard, although it didn’t resemble the breed otherwise. It snarled and snapped, intent on fastening its teeth around Ted’s throat, and Ted wrapped his hands around its neck in an attempt to hold it at bay. The dog-beast’s rear legs—one larger than the other—scrabbled at the ground as it fought to get close enough to sink its teeth into its prey. Ted grimaced, his arms trembling with the effort of trying to hold off the animal. Considering the massive size of the thing, it would have been too strong for most men to handle, and whatever physical strength Ted had possessed in his youth was long gone. He was relying on adrenaline and sheer force of will right now, but Joyce knew they wouldn’t be enough in the end. She feared he had only moments, if not seconds, before the monster dog overwhelmed him, fastened its jaws around his throat, and crushed his windpipe in a spray of blood.</p><p>Part of her—the primitive animal part that was only interested in self-preservation at all costs—wanted nothing more than to turn and run away as fast as her less-than-svelte legs were capable of carrying her. In fact, without fully being aware of it, she had already half-turned and taken a step away from the pond. But she forced herself to turn back. She would never forgive herself if she ran off and left Ted to die. She had to do something to help him, but what? She wasn’t about to try and grapple with the damned beast, and the closest thing to a weapon she had was her sometimes too-sharp tongue, which had filleted many a lazy student over the years. So, without anything else in her arsenal to rely on, she drew in a deep breath and, using what one of her fellow teachers had once referred to as “The Voice of Irresistible Authority,” she shouted a single word.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The word sounded harsh as a whip crack on the chill autumn air, and it echoed across the pond. The dog-thing stopped snarling and turned to look at her, confusion and perhaps a touch of fear in its eyes. Joyce had the feeling that with that one word she had reached something deep inside the beast, an inner core which recognized that humans occupied a higher rung on the evolutionary ladder, and thus were its masters. The creature lowered its gaze and its tail—a hairless appendage that looked like it should have been attached to a giant rat—drooped between its legs. It let out a soft whine.</p><p>Ted, who’d been just as surprised as the dog by Joyce’s command, loosened his grip on the animal’s neck. Instantly, the grotesque canine’s upper lip curled away from its teeth, and the confusion in its eyes was replaced by blazing fury. The creature tore free from Ted’s grasp and lunged forward with a snarl.</p><p>Joyce screamed as the monster-dog sank its teeth into Ted’s throat and began shaking him back and forth, as if he were nothing but a toy. Ted’s eyes widened with fear and pain, but although his mouth gaped wide, no sound emerged. An instant later Joyce understood why, as thick blood geysered upward. It ran down the sides of Ted’s mouth and turned his white hair crimson before soaking into the ground beneath.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream again, but the sound died in her throat. Something strange was happening. She thought at first that it was a trick of the waning light, but Ted’s pale pink skin was losing its color, becoming a dull slate gray. More than that, his skin was drawing in on itself, tightening against his bones, muscle and fat shrinking as he transformed into an unwrapped mummy before her eyes. Crazily, Joyce was reminded of one of the last trips she’d taken with her husband before the cancer spread to the point where he was unable to travel. They’d gone camping in Hocking Hills, and instead of sleeping bags, they’d taken a king-sized inflatable mattress with a battery-powered fan that inflated it within moments. The fan had a reverse switch on it that also deflated the mattress, so that when it was finished, it was completely flat, curled slightly at the edges and crisscrossed with wrinkly lines. That’s what Ted looked like now: a deflated gray air mattress with a skeleton inside.</p><p>The monster-dog held its grip on Ted’s throat a moment longer, and Joyce watched as the blood smeared on Ted’s face and the creature’s muzzle dried and flaked away. Like the monster had absorbed Ted’s life energy, drawn it into itself, and was determined not to let go of him until it had gotten every last bit. When it was finally finished, it withdrew its teeth from Ted’s desiccated flesh and turned its attention to her.</p><p>She heard someone whisper, “Run,” and it took her a moment to realize she was the whisperer. Hearing her own voice broke her paralysis, and she turned and ran.</p><p>The hill that led back up to the apartment complex wasn’t steep, but she was hardly in the best of shape. When she’d been younger, her idea of exercise had been a leisurely stroll in the park, and now most of her physical activity involved walking around antiques stores. Adrenaline could only do so much to compensate for a mostly sedentary lifestyle, and her heart pounded an uneven rhythm in her ears, and her lungs burned as if they were aflame. Her legs felt heavy and shaky, and they became more so with each step she took. Finally, something gave way in her right knee, her leg buckled, and she went down. She landed on her side and slid several feet down the hill before coming to a stop. She lay there, pulse thrumming, lungs heaving, knowing there was no way she could hope to escape the monster-dog now—if she’d ever had a chance in the first place. She closed her eyes and waited to feel the creature’s teeth sink into her throat.</p><p>But she felt nothing.</p><p>She opened her eyes and pushed herself to a sitting position. She turned to look back toward the pond, wondering what had happened. Had something scared the dog-thing off? Or had it simply been too full for another meal? For an instant she allowed herself to hope that she might survive this, but then she saw the creature. It sat next to Ted’s corpse, looking at her, head cocked to the side in a very doglike fashion. She understood at once what had happened, and the realization filled her with despair. The monster-dog hadn’t chased her because it hadn’t needed to. She was too slow, old, and overweight to get away. The creature had only needed to wait for her to bring herself down, and she had done so.</p><p>As she watched, the great misshapen beast came lurching toward her on its mismatched limbs, crooked mouth open, discolored tongue hanging out, eyes burning with horrible, inhuman hunger.</p><p>She screamed, but not for long.</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I hate this damn car,” Dean said.</p><p>“You hate every car that’s not the Impala,” Sam countered.</p><p>“Yeah, well, this one’s especially sucktastic. And it smells like feet.”</p><p>They’d picked up the brown “crapmobile”—just one of Dean’s nicknames for it—behind a bar in Canton, Ohio. Dean would have preferred “borrowing” something with a bit more class, or at least something that didn’t drive like a turd with tires, but ever since they’d gone off the grid in order to avoid registering on the Leviathan’s radar, they’d been forced to keep a low profile, which meant no Impala. It also meant starting a sideline as reluctant car thieves—all for the greater good, of course. If the brothers failed to kill Dick Roman and ended up as human happy meals for him and his fellow monsters, the rest of the planet would be next on the menu. They were careful to take cars that no one would miss much, junkers that would be easy for their owners to replace and which the cops wouldn’t work too hard to find. Dean had his hands full keeping the rust heaps they stole running, but there was only so much he could do. He constantly kept his fingers crossed that they wouldn’t find themselves in a high-speed pursuit. As rough as the crapmobile was running, if he tromped on the gas, the rods would probably shoot out of the engine like friggin’ missiles.</p><p>“Here we are,” Sam said, pointing to a wooden sign on the side of the road. “Brennan, Ohio, which, according to the sign, is home to the Battling Brennan Brahman.”</p><p>Dean frowned as they drove across the town line. “Brahman? Aren’t they a kind of water buffalo or something?”</p><p>“Sort of. They’re a type of cattle named after the sacred cow of Hinduism.”</p><p>“Lousy choice for a school mascot, if you ask me. Alliteration only goes so far, you know?”</p><p>After they’d dropped in to the local sheriff’s department as a “courtesy” to let them know that two FBI agents were in town and to glean any additional information they could about the deaths, they drove through Brennan to get a feel for the place. Not that they really needed to. They might have gone from Northeast Ohio to Southwest, but for all the miles they’d driven, they might as well have stayed in the same place. After all the years he’d spent on the road, most Midwestern towns looked alike to Dean, and Brennan was no exception. A downtown consisting of small local businesses housed in old buildings, suburbs dotted with mini malls and chain restaurants, and a decaying industrial section, which in Brennan’s case was a closed bicycle factory on the south edge of town.</p><p>“You need a whole factory to make bikes?” Dean said. Sam just shrugged.</p><p>They found a cheap no-tell motel not far from the factory called the Wickline Inn, although Dean had no idea who or what a wickline was. They parked in front of the main office, and Sam went inside alone to register them. They always asked for a room as far from the main office as they could get, preferably one with empty rooms on either side. They’d been attacked in hotels more than once over the years, and the last thing they wanted to do was endanger any innocent lives.</p><p>Once Sam came out of the office with their room key, they pulled around to the back of the motel, parked, removed their stuff from the car—a couple backpacks with clothes and toiletries, Sam’s computer, and a couple duffle bags containing weapons—and entered the room.</p><p>Once they were inside, Dean wrinkled his nose. “Man, this place smells like mothballs and ass.”</p><p>“No argument there,” Sam said.</p><p>They put their stuff on the beds and gave the room a quick once over, checking the bathroom, looking under the beds, and testing the window locks. Only when they were satisfied the room was clear did they lock the door. Every hunter worth his or her rock salt-filled shotgun knew better than to cut off a possible exit until they were sure they didn’t need it. The brothers didn’t bother unpacking in case they needed to grab their gear and get the hell out of there in a hurry. Not for the first time, Dean thought how much his life resembled that of a criminal on the run. He’d never told Sam, but for a while now, whenever they settled into a hotel room, he thought of his time with Lisa and Ben, and how damned nice it had been to go to sleep and wake up in the same place day after day.</p><p>The room had a small desk by the window, and Sam set his laptop on it, raised the lid, and booted up the machine. When the screen came to life, he said, “Once again the Winchesters are open for business.” He sat down in front of the computer and started typing.</p><p>Dean sat down on the end of one of the beds, removed Bobby’s flask from the pocket of his brown leather jacket, unscrewed the lid, and took a drink. He didn’t take much, just a sip for maintenance. When he finished he replaced the lid, but instead of putting the flask away, he held it in his hands and looked at it for several moments. He remembered finding the bullet hole in Bobby’s cap, remembered turning around in the van and seeing the corresponding hole in Bobby’s forehead, remembered the blood...</p><p>“This is bull crap, Sammy.”</p><p>“What is?” Sam didn’t turn away from the computer screen. Once he got absorbed in the virtual world, he was harder to distract than a soul-starved demon intent on making a deal.</p><p><em>“This,”</em> Dean insisted, gesturing to take in the room. “Screwing around in Ohio when we should be nailing Dick Roman’s hide to the wall.”</p><p>Sam stopped typing and turned to look at his brother. “I know how you feel. I want to get Dick as much as you do.” He frowned. “Wait, that didn’t come out right.”</p><p>“Ha ha. That’s friggin’ hilarious. Quit fooling around, Sam. I’m serious.”</p><p>“So am I. Well, not about the dick joke. But I want to stop the Leviathan, too. Not only to keep them from turning the human race into quarter pounders, but because I want justice for Bobby. Just like you.”</p><p>Bobby Singer had been shot in the head by none other than Dick Roman himself during a scuffle with the Leviathan, and he’d died in a hospital not long after.</p><p>The Leviathan were among God’s first creations, predating humans and even angels, but the beasts proved too wild and uncontrollable, concerned only with sating their savage hunger, and God banished them to Purgatory. <em>Good work on that one, God,</em> Dean thought. Their friend and ally Cass—also known as the angel Castiel—had inadvertently released the Leviathan when he absorbed all the souls in Purgatory in order to gain the power to defeat the archangel Raphael. Once free of their ancient prison, the Leviathan began planning to take over the world, intending to keep humanity alive solely as a food source. Among other things, the creatures possessed the ability to analyze a human’s DNA and transform into an exact physical duplicate of their target. So the leader of the Leviathan assumed the guise of billionaire businessman Dick Roman, and used the man’s considerable financial and political assets to build a secret empire around the world.</p><p>The brothers knew that the Leviathan’s ultimate plan was the subjugation of humanity, but exactly how they intended to accomplish this—and how the Winchesters could stop them—they didn’t know. That lack of knowledge gnawed at them like rabid rats, especially in Dean’s case. Bobby had been more than an encyclopedic source of information, an endless fount of useful contacts, and a perpetually grouchy pain in the ass. He’d even been more than a close family friend. Bobby had been like an uncle to Dean and Sam. Hell, he’d practically been a second father to them, especially since their own dad had been on the road hunting and killing monsters much of the time while they were growing up. Both brothers missed him like hell.</p><p>There wasn’t anything in this life that Dean wanted more than to take down Dick Roman, and every second he and Sam spent doing anything other than bringing the pain to that shark-toothed son of a bitch was a second wasted as far as he was concerned. But they were here, so they might as well get to work.</p><p>He remembered something he’d been told recently. <em>Hunting’s the only clarity you’re gonna find in this life. And that makes you luckier than most.</em></p><p><em>Preach it, Brother Ness,</em> Dean thought. He could use a double-shot of clarity right now. Make that a triple. Besides, their detour to Brennan might not be a complete waste of time. <em>Who knows? There might even be a decent strip club in this town.</em></p><p>“All right.” He sighed and took another hit from Bobby’s flask. “Anything new since we left Canton?”</p><p>Sam looked at him a moment longer, and Dean thought his brother was going to say something about his drinking, but instead he turned back to face the laptop. He typed for a minute, stopped, then leaned forward and stared at the screen. Dean had seen him like this a thousand times before, and he knew what it meant.</p><p>“You got something.”</p><p>“Yeah. Looks like there’s been two more deaths, an older man and woman this time. According to the local paper—<em>The Brennan Broadsider</em>—they were found near a pond in back of the apartment complex where they lived. It happened two nights ago.”</p><p>Dean stood, slipped the flask back into his jacket pocket, and went to look at the screen over Sam’s shoulder.</p><p>“Does it say if they were getting their freak on when they died?”</p><p>Sam gave him a look.</p><p>“Hey, if you gotta go, you might as well go out smiling.”</p><p>Sam turned back to the screen. “They were mummified like the others. Literally nothing left but skin and bones.”</p><p>“We ganked Chronos, so we know he didn’t do it, but it sure sounds like his style.”</p><p>“Yeah, but the pattern’s different. Chronos killed in groups of three over a period of years. So far four people have died in Brennan, all in the last week.”</p><p>“And I assume they all ended up looking like they were on the diet plan from Hell.”</p><p>“Yep.” Sam continued reading. “The town officials are pretty spooked. They’re worried the deaths are the result of some kind of toxic chemical or exotic disease. They’ve even sent tissue samples from victims to the CDC.”</p><p>“Unless those guys have doctors who specialize in Weird with a capital W, I don’t think they’re going to find anything useful.”</p><p>Sam closed his laptop. “Looks like it’s up to us then.”</p><p>Dean gave his brother a wry smile. “Isn’t it always?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You sure we don’t need protective suits? You know, like the kind they wear in those movies about plagues and stuff?”</p><p>Sam regarded the kid from the rental office. He was in his early twenties, probably fresh out of college and working his first real job. He was medium height, thin, with neatly trimmed black hair and an angular goatee that made him look kind of douchey. He wore a semi-expensive tie and highly polished shoes—both looked brand new—along with a dark blue windbreaker. Back at Arbor Vale’s main office, he’d introduced himself as David Something—Stephenson maybe. Although Sam wasn’t sure. His brain wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders these days, and every once in a while it slipped a gear. <em>Beats total insanity,</em> he thought.</p><p>After he and Dean had defeated Lucifer and prevented Armageddon, Sam’s body and soul had been separated. His body remained on Earth, while his soul was trapped in the pit with Lucifer and the archangel Michael. Sam’s body retained his memories, but without a soul he was the equivalent of a sociopath, devoid of all human feeling. In many ways, being soulless had made him a more efficient hunter. He was more decisive, quicker to act, and completely ruthless. Unfortunately, he also didn’t care if he caused any collateral damage during his hunts. If innocent people died while he was killing some monster, so what? It was simply the cost of doing business.</p><p>Meanwhile in Hell, Lucifer and Michael played with his soul like two bored cats sharing a single ball of string, and those cats had some damn wicked claws. They shredded his soul as if it were tissue paper, and when it was finally rejoined to Sam’s body—thanks to Death himself, no less—the damage done threatened to drive him insane. Death established a psychic wall to protect Sam from the madness that dwelt within him, but that wall had fallen, and it was now up to Sam to hold the insanity at bay on his own. Most days he did a good job hiding the crazy, but it took a lot out of him, and he wasn’t always certain he could trust his senses and memory.</p><p>So maybe the kid’s name was Stephenson, maybe not. At least he was sure the kid was real. Well... reasonably sure.</p><p>“Not in this situation,” Sam told Maybe-Stephenson. “We’re confident that the danger is minimal.”</p><p>“But there <em>is</em> danger,” the kid insisted. “Right?”</p><p>Sam and Dean were wearing their best “We’re government employees” monkey suits, and had introduced themselves as agents Smith and Jones. They’d flashed their faux FBI credentials at the kid and claimed they were there to assist the CDC in its investigation. He bought it, and now he was leading them, reluctantly, to the duck pond at the rear of the apartment complex.</p><p>Dean glanced sideways at him. “If there was any chance of contamination, don’t you think my partner and I would be wearing...” He trailed off and looked to Sam for help.</p><p>“Biohazard gear,” Sam supplied.</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “That stuff.”</p><p>“Maybe,” the kid said, “but don’t you guys get special shots or something to inoculate you against deadly diseases, radiation, and other nasty crap? You know, A-level medicine, the kind of drugs the government pretends don’t exist.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Dean said. “You spend a lot of time surfing conspiracy websites, don’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah. So?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just a hunch.” He gave Sam a look that said, <em>We got us a real genius here,</em> and Sam suppressed a smile.</p><p>Arbor Vale was an older complex, built sometime in the seventies, Sam guessed, but it was clean and the grounds were well maintained. It didn’t look like a place where supernatural evil lurked, but if his life as a hunter had taught him anything, it was that appearances meant jack. While monsters, demons, ghosts, and other nasties tended to be drawn to darkness and decay, they were just as likely to be found sniffing for prey in a well-to-do suburb as an abandoned graveyard. Evil—real Evil, the kind with a capital E—could be anywhere at any time.</p><p>The pond lay at the bottom of a gently sloping hill, and the Brennan PD had erected a crime-scene tape barrier at the top of the hill to warn anyone from getting too close. The tape was wound between a series of metal stakes driven through orange traffic cones, but despite the officers’ best efforts, the tape drooped low enough for them to step over.</p><p>“Seriously?” Dean said as he eyed the tape barrier. “Do the Deputy Dawgs in this town really think that’s going to keep anyone out?”</p><p>“I guess they don’t get many major crime scenes here,” Sam said.</p><p>The Winchesters stepped over without hesitation, but the kid hung back.</p><p>“Do you really need me to go down there with you?” he asked.</p><p>Dean gestured toward the pond. “You see those ducks swimming down there? Do you think they’d stick around if there was any toxic goo in the area?”</p><p>“Ducks could have a natural immunity to whatever it was that killed those two old people.” The kid’s eyes narrowed. “Or maybe whatever got them was genetically engineered to only be fatal to humans.”</p><p>“Man, you really need to lay off the Internet,” Dean said.</p><p>“Besides, I don’t want to go anywhere near those woods.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a glance.</p><p>“Why not?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Feral dogs,” the kid explained. “Rumor is the woods around town are full of them. I haven’t seen any myself, but lots of people have. There’s one that’s supposed to be an especially scary bastard. Big and black.”</p><p>“A black dog.” Dean shot his brother another look. “You don’t say.”</p><p>“You can go back to the rental office,” Sam said. “If we need you for anything else, we’ll find you there.”</p><p>The kid reached into his shirt pocket, removed a business card, and handed it to Sam, who was gratified to see the last name on it was Stephens. Close enough.</p><p>“Tell you what, you need me, call me. Nothing personal, but I don’t want to catch anything from you guys. I don’t want to end up a human-sized prune, you know?”</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, Stephens turned and started back toward the rental office, almost but not quite running.</p><p>Sam stuck the card in his inner jacket pocket, and together he and Dean started down the hill toward the pond.</p><p>“Can you say paranoid?” Dean said.</p><p>“You can’t blame him. Something bad <em>did happen</em> here.”</p><p>“You think that bad had anything to do with the black dog Braveheart mentioned?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I don’t know. Could be.”</p><p>Sightings of spectral black dogs went back centuries—it was the legend Arthur Conan Doyle based <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> on—but there was no definite answer to what the creatures were. Most hunters tended to believe one of two possibilities: either they were creatures of demonic origin or they were forms taken by shapeshifters. Sam didn’t see any reason why both explanations couldn’t be true. After all, the ecosystem of the supernatural world was just as varied in its own way as that of the natural one.</p><p>“Could be something living in the pond,” Sam continued.</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean allowed. “But if there is, the ducks don’t seem to be bothered by it.”</p><p>As they drew near the pond, they saw two smaller taped-off areas, one close to the water, one a bit farther uphill, both arranged in roughly rectangular patterns.</p><p>“Looks like the local PD believes in being thorough,” Dean said. “I’m surprised they didn’t put up a great big I’d Turn Back if I Were You! sign.”</p><p>“A musical reference?” Sam asked. “I would’ve expected something from <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> or maybe <em>Porky’s II.”</em></p><p>“Just trying to broaden the repertoire.”</p><p>The brothers swept their gazes back and forth as they bantered, senses alive and alert. A big part of being a hunter was paying attention to your environment. Sights, sounds, and smells could all provide clues to the presence of a supernatural manifestation, but the most important sense of all was one that didn’t have a name. It wasn’t psychic, exactly. More like heightened instinct. Hunt long enough, <em>survive</em> long enough, and you developed the ability to know when something wasn’t right. It was a subconscious process, not a cognitive one, but both Sam and Dean had learned long ago to trust it, and right now that sense was telling Sam that whatever had happened here to cause the deaths of two people, it hadn’t been natural.</p><p>They reached the tape rectangle on the hillside first. Sam removed his EMF detector from his outer jacket pocket, turned it on, and held it close to the ground. The electromagnetic readings in the area were normal, and he switched the machine off and placed it back in his pocket.</p><p>“So we know that whatever did this wasn’t a ghost,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s been two days since the deaths,” Sam pointed out. “Any electromagnetic energy left behind might’ve faded in that time.”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>Both brothers squatted to get a closer look at the ground. They didn’t break the tape, though. They preferred not to disturb crime scenes any more than necessary, just in case it turned out that an ordinary human scumbag was responsible instead of a thing that went bump in the night.</p><p>“According to the <em>Broadsider,</em> this is where the woman’s body was found.” Sam pulled a small notebook out of his shirt pocket and opened it to the most recent entry. “Her name was Joyce Nagrosky, and she was a retired high school English teacher. The other victim was Ted Boykin. He was retired, too. Used to be the principal at the school where Joyce taught.”</p><p>“Think they came down here for a little extracurricular workout?” Dean asked. “Just ‘cause they were enjoying their golden years doesn’t mean they couldn’t enjoy each other, too. I mean, the guy’s last name <em>was</em> Boykin. <em>Boink-ing.</em> Get it?”</p><p>Sam just looked at him.</p><p>“I thought it was funny,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Despite his brother’s lousy joke, Sam knew there was a serious question behind it. Supernatural creatures preyed on humans for a variety of reasons, but the most common one was to feed. Some, like the Leviathan, fed on humans literally. Vampires drank human blood. Some ate only certain parts of the body, like kitsune, which fed on the pituitary gland.</p><p>Amy’s face flashed through his mind, and for a moment he thought he heard her voice whispering in his ear. <em>All the coolest people are freaks...</em> He shoved the memory of her aside, along with the pang of guilt that came with it. He had work to do.</p><p>Some monsters drained life energy. Some, such as succubi and incubi, fed on sexual energy. If Joyce and Ted had been doing the wild thing by the pond, they might have attracted the attention of something even wilder.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Sam said after a moment’s consideration. “They may have been a couple—the paper didn’t say anything about that—but this area’s a little too close to the apartment complex for them to have any privacy.”</p><p>“Maybe they were into the whole thrill-seeking thing,” Dean countered, but without much conviction. “I don’t smell anything weird. No scent of sulfur, rotting fish, or decayed flowers.” He sniffed. “No demon dog stink, either.”</p><p>“The area’s not cold,” Sam said. “Well, not any colder than normal for this time of year.”</p><p>“The ground’s pretty well torn up,” Dean said. “The locals could’ve done it. Like you said earlier, they’re probably not used to handling a real crime scene.”</p><p>“Could be,” Sam allowed. “But a dog could’ve done it, too.”</p><p>“Size of these marks, it would’ve been a big one.”</p><p>“Yep. No blood, though. An animal that big, if it attacked someone, it would’ve made a mess.”</p><p>Dean pressed his index finger to the ground and pushed the tip into the dirt. “Hasn’t rained recently. So if there had been any blood, it wouldn’t have been washed away.”</p><p>The brothers stood, and Dean wiped his fingertip off on his pants leg.</p><p>“Let’s go check out where they found the principal,” Sam said.</p><p>The brothers walked down to the edge of the pond and examined the second cordoned-off area. There was less grass there, and the ground was softer. There were obvious prints, mostly from the police and paramedics, probably, but there were also a number of what appeared to be claw marks in the ground, along with a single clear paw print. A damn big one.</p><p>The brothers stood thinking for a moment, the ducks on the pond keeping their distance and eyeing them warily.</p><p>After a bit, Dean said, “Here’s how I think it played out. Ted and Joyce walk down to the pond. Maybe they’re taking a stroll, feeding the ducks, thinking about getting busy later, whatever. Then our killer dog approaches from over there.” He pointed to the woods. “It attacks them and Ted, being the stand-up guy he is, tries to slow it down long enough so Joyce can get away. She runs, but Cujo makes quick work of old Ted, chases after her, and that’s all she wrote.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “That’s how I see it, too. But how exactly did it kill them? The paper didn’t say anything about their bodies being ravaged by an animal.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. They were mummified. Hey, you don’t suppose they were just really, <em>really</em> old?”</p><p>“I think we need to take a look at those bodies.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>As Sam and Dean headed back up the hill, neither of them noticed a shadowy figure step out from between the trees at the edge of the pond and watch them depart.</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A couple hours later, Sam and Dean returned to the pond. They’d ditched their monkey suits for their normal street clothes, something for which Dean was profoundly grateful. He wore his leather jacket, Sam wore his blue coat, and both of them had hoodies and flannel shirts underneath. Even when it was cold outside, the brothers rarely wore anything heavier. Thick clothes could slow you down, and a slow hunter was all too often a dead hunter. Layers were the way to go. You could strip them off as needed, and ditching your outer jacket was a good way to quickly change your appearance in case someone—like the cops—was looking for you.</p><p>Dean never felt comfortable in a suit, with the possible exception of his 1940s threads, although he had to admit they had their uses. Not only did they make it easier to get cops to talk to you, they worked magic on hospital employees. They had no problem getting the morgue attendant to grant them access to the bodies of Joyce Nagrosky and Ted Boykin. Better yet, since the county’s medical examiner suspected some sort of contagion was at work in their deaths, he hadn’t conducted full autopsies. He was waiting for the CDC to report on the tissue samples he’d sent, which meant that Sam and Dean had a pair of pristine bodies to check out. Sometimes the key detail in a supernatural death was subtle, and a doctor might destroy an important piece of evidence without meaning to. But they hadn’t had to worry about that this time.</p><p>Both bodies had been the same. They reminded Dean of the empty husks that cicadas left behind when they changed into their adult forms. <em>Damn creepy things, those bugs!</em> According to the ME’s preliminary findings, the bodies still possessed all their internal organs, but it was as if every drop of moisture had been drained out of them. Not just blood, either. All fluid was gone—water, spinal fluid, gastric juices, you name it—leaving Joyce and Ted looking like skeletons covered in thin gray parchment paper. <em>Corpse-a-gami,</em> Dean thought. The bodies shared one other salient feature: vicious gashes on the throat. The ME postulated that the injuries had been delivered post mortem by some sort of scavenger. But the way he and Sam figured it, the wounds had been caused by the monster dog, which Dean had consequently taken to calling Dogula.</p><p>Their examination of Joyce and Ted’s bodies hadn’t provided any clues as to the nature of the creature that had killed them, and a follow-up Internet search hadn’t yielded anything of use, so the brothers had brought a variety of weapons with them. Pistols loaded with silver bullets, a Winchester 1887 shotgun filled with rock salt—which Dean carried—a knife of cold iron dipped in holy water, and a demon-killing blade. Like the Boy Scouts, hunters believed in being prepared. Or, as Bobby used to put it, <em>Better to haul some extra hardware than to end up as little chunks of undigested meat in a pile of monster scat.</em></p><p>“This isn’t right, Sam. I know something’s not kosher in this town, and I know I agreed to look into it, but I can’t help feeling that we’re dishonoring Bobby’s memory by putting off going after Roman. And don’t tell me that we have a responsibility to help the good people of Brennan. The world is filled with monsters, and no matter what we do, we’ll never get them all. There are just too damn many of them, and there are only two of us. We have to take care of family business first, and that’s what Dick Roman is—not to mention that he and his army of pet piranhas are a threat to the whole freakin’ world!”</p><p>They’d continued walking the entire time Dean spoke, and had reached the edge of the woods. They stopped and Sam turned to face his brother.</p><p>“You think Bobby would want us to walk away from this case?” he asked. Then added, “Or any case, for that matter?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said, “but that doesn’t mean—“</p><p>“Before you go any further, hear me out. After our run-in with Chronos, I started thinking.”</p><p>“Started?” Dean snorted. “Do you ever stop?”</p><p>Sam ignored him and went on. “The magic Chronos used to travel through time was pretty powerful stuff. Makes sense, because he was a god, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. So?”</p><p>“So even though the bodies we saw today didn’t look exactly like Chronos’ victims, there were some striking similarities.”</p><p>Dean frowned. “You think we might be dealing with another god here?”</p><p>“Too early to tell. But like I said, our run-in with Chronos got me thinking. If we’re going to have any hope of ganking Dick Roman and stopping the Leviathan, we’re going to need some serious firepower. A case like this, where big-time mojo is involved...”</p><p>“Wait a minute. Are you saying that you want to capture the monster, spirit, god, or whatever it is and use it as a weapon against the Leviathan?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “Whatever the Leviathan are exactly, we know they were the first beings God created. That means they’re alive, right? If that’s the case—“</p><p>“Then they could be killed by draining their life force.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Possibly. So if we can learn how Joyce and Ted were killed, along with the two others who died before them, maybe we’ll be able to find some way to use it against the Leviathan.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s a good idea, Sammy. Fighting fire with fire hasn’t always worked out so well for us. Two words: demon blood.”</p><p>Sam lowered his gaze to the ground, but otherwise didn’t reply.</p><p>Despite his misgivings, Dean could feel his excitement building. He surely wouldn’t mind having the supernatural equivalent of a backpack nuke to shove down Dick Roman’s slimy throat. There was also a certain symmetry to the idea that he liked, and which he thought Bobby would appreciate. The Leviathan—creatures that lived solely to feed—would be destroyed by a power that devoured their life energy.</p><p>“So you’re saying this case isn’t so much about ganking some random monster as it is about, what? Research and development?”</p><p>“Something like that. And if we get to kill a monster in the bargain, so much the better.”</p><p>Dean thought about it for a moment. “Okay, I’m in. Let’s go find Dogula.”</p><p>The brothers entered the woods. Oak, elm, and ash trees predominated, and the ground held only a scattering of leaves. Good. They’d make less noise that way. The last thing they needed to be doing was crunching leaves underfoot and giving away their position when there might be a life force-sucking monster running around. Dean found himself wishing that it had rained recently. The ground was too hard for there to be any tracks, and while the underbrush showed signs of something having passed through recently, Ohio had a deer overpopulation problem, and there was no way to tell if it was Dogula or a herd of Bambis. Joyce and Ted had died two days before, and there was a chance that the monster responsible had moved on, but Dean doubted it. The things he and Sam hunted tended to stick to one location, more often than not, whether because their particular species was territorial or because they were mystically bound to a specific area.</p><p>Dean spoke in a soft, low voice. “So how did you miss the reports of a black dog running around town? You losing your research-fu?”</p><p>“I guess no one made the connection between the black dog and the deaths. No reason why they should.”</p><p>“Yeah. Sometimes I forget Joe and Jane Normal don’t know all this stuff exists.”</p><p>That was one of the reasons Dean enjoyed horror movies so much. Sure, they were hilarious because of how screwed up their lore was, not to mention how many insanely dumb decisions the characters made. But also, when he watched them, he could imagine what it was like to be an ordinary person, enjoying horror flicks for nothing more than a fun scare, knowing all the time he was safe because ghoulies, ghosties, and long-leggedy beasties were only make believe.</p><p>The sound of a branch snapping broke the silence like a gunshot, and the brothers froze. Dean’s senses, honed from hundreds of battles, screamed at him that they were about to be under attack, and he knew better than to question them. He shoved Sam to the side and dove in the opposite direction an instant before a large black form hurtled through the space where they had been standing. The brothers hit the ground, rolled, and came up on their feet in time to see the creature spin around to face them, jagged teeth bared in a snarl. Even by monster standards, the thing was one ugly son of a bitch. Its body was twisted, its features distorted, and none of its legs matched in length. It had patches of bare skin, as if it suffered from mange, but now that Dean got a good look at it, he saw that its fur wasn’t black—at least, not entirely. It <em>was</em> black in places, but it was also brown and gray, and its different-colored fur had different consistencies, longer and thicker here, shorter and thinner there. The creature’s sections were separated by thin lines of red scar tissue, as if it weren’t a single beast but rather a conglomeration of different canines.</p><p>“That’s thing’s not Dogula,” Dean said, “it’s Frankenmutt!”</p><p>He dropped the shotgun to the ground. Rock salt wouldn’t be worth a damn against something corporeal. He drew his trusty Colt .45, aimed at the spot between Frankenmutt’s eyes, and squeezed off a round. Sam had drawn his Beretta at the same time and he fired as well, aiming for the same target.</p><p>Frankenmutt was roughly the size of a St. Bernard, and ungainly as the creature looked, Dean expected it would move with all the speed and grace of an iron anvil. He was confident their bullets would hit the beast. But instead of Frankenmutt’s brains exploding out the back of its head to decorate the tree behind it, the monstrous canine became a dark blur and a split second later it crouched three feet to the right of its previous position. Bullets ripped chunks of bark from the tree, but Frankenmutt was unharmed. A good result if he and Sam were looking to start new careers as unorthodox lumberjacks, but not so good if they wanted to actually kill the goddamned monster.</p><p>Frankenmutt lowered its head and glared at them with mismatched, rheumy eyes. It growled deep in its throat, a strange sound, with separate pitches overlapping, almost as if two dogs were growling instead of one. Dean kept his gaze focused on its eyes. You could always tell when a human opponent was going to make a move by watching their eyes, and this was also true for most supernatural creatures. Those that had eyes, anyway. Unfortunately, Frankenmutt’s were different sizes and colors, and they worked independently of each other, like a lizard’s. Not only was it freaky as hell, it made it impossible to guess the creatures intentions.</p><p>Dean was caught off guard when Frankenmutt started running toward them, moving with a weird lurching stride that was surprisingly fast. He managed to get off another round from his .45, but the bullet went wild and struck the ground near the dog’s right paw. The near miss only pissed it off, and it swerved toward Dean, leaping for him, jaws wide and flecked with foam, discolored tongue lolling from the side of its mouth. Dean dropped his .45 and raised his hands in time to grab hold of the dog’s throat as it slammed into him. He maintained his grip as the creature’s weight bore him to the ground. The underbrush softened his landing somewhat, but the jolt still knocked the wind out of him. Frankenmutt snarled with savage rage, jaws snapping as it tried to sink its teeth into Dean’s throat. He managed to hold the creature at bay, but it wasn’t easy. The damned thing was a hell of a lot stronger than it looked. Its teeth were only inches from the soft flesh of his neck, and they were edging closer with each second. If the beast bit him, it would start draining his life force, and once the process began, Dean didn’t know how long it would take. Maybe minutes, maybe only seconds. Dean wondered what he’d look like if he got prune-ified, and the resultant mental image wasn’t pretty.</p><p>Sam stepped forward, assumed a shooting stance, leveled his Beretta, and fired three bullets into Frankenmutt’s side in quick succession. Dean felt the creature jerk with the impact of each round, and blood issued from the wounds. Not red, though. This stuff was black, thick, and slow-moving, more like syrup. The black goo made him think of the gunk that poured out of Leviathan when they were wounded, but this ichor was darker and it stank like rotten meat. Despite its injuries, Frankenmutt didn’t appear to be in any pain. If anything, it seemed more enraged. It tore free of Dean’s grip, jumped off him, and lurched toward Sam, growling and snapping.</p><p>Sam held his ground and fired twice more as the monstrous canine bore down on him. The bullets took out hunks of flesh and made more ichor flow, but the creature barely slowed as it lunged toward him. It fastened its teeth on Sam’s right leg just above the ankle, and Sam let out a cry of pain and fired point blank at Frankenmutt’s head. Part of the dog’s skull was sheared away, taking an ear with it. The beast let go of Sam, staggered backward, and then shook its head back and forth rapidly, as if its head was wet and it was trying to dry itself. Blood and bits of brain matter flew through the air, and then the creature turned and ran off into the woods, swerving as it went, almost as if it were drunk.</p><p>Sam sat on the ground and took in a hissing breath. He placed his Beretta next to him, and gingerly began to inspect his wound. Dean got up, retrieved his .45, and walked over to Sam, scanning the area for any sign that Frankenmutt was planning to double back and renew its attack.</p><p>“How bad is it?”</p><p>“I’ll live.” Sam’s sock was wet with blood, and when he peeled it away from the skin, a ragged wound was revealed. “It’s not too deep. I think most of the damage was caused when I shot him in the head. The impact caused him to jerk away from my ankle, and his teeth tore the skin.”</p><p>“All right. Let’s tape you up and get you back to the car.” Dean knelt next to his brother, reached into one of his jacket’s outer pockets, and pulled out a roll of silvery duct tape. Their first aid kit was in the crapmobile, but duct tape would make an effective field dressing until they reached the car.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Sam insisted. “We have to go after the dog.”</p><p>He tried to stand, but when he put his weight on his wounded ankle, it buckled, and he sat back down, grimacing with pain.</p><p>“Frankenmutt can wait until after we’ve plugged your leak,” Dean said. “Now shut up and sit still.” He ripped off a length of tape and went to work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean’s field dressing was good enough to allow Sam to make it back to the motel. Once there, he went into the bathroom, carefully cut the tape away with a pair of surgical scissors, and threw the blood-smeared mess into the trash. He then cleaned the wound—first with holy water, then with soap and regular water, and finally with alcohol. Afterward, he lathered on some antibiotic cream, then bandaged and wrapped it. Satisfied, he dry swallowed a couple ibuprofen before limping out of the bathroom. The injury was going to slow him down, but not as much as he’d feared.</p><p>Dean had tossed his jacket on his bed, and he sat at the table in his hoodie, leaning back in the chair, feet up, staring at the laptop screen.</p><p>Sam smiled. “I hope you’re not checking out one of those sites where you have to click ‘I verify that I’m eighteen years or older’ for access.”</p><p>He regretted it as soon as he said it. Considering how obsessed Dean had been with Dick Roman in the past few weeks, Sam would have far preferred his brother to visit a few sleazy websites than try to dig up still more information on their least favorite Leviathan.</p><p>“I’ve been surfing the web looking for the skinny on butt-ugly patchwork dogs.” When Sam didn’t reply right away, Dean added, “What? Like you’re the only one who knows his way around a mouse pad?”</p><p>“Skinny?” Sam said.</p><p>“Yeah, well... guess I picked up some new vocabulary in 1944.” He took his feet off the table, sat up, and faced Sam. “Speaking of picking things up, we should probably get you to a doctor before you come down with Franken-rabies.”</p><p>“You’re joking, right? Supernatural creatures don’t carry natural diseases.”</p><p>“Still, better safe than hydrophobic, right? All it’ll take is a series of incredibly painful abdominal injections.” Dean grinned.</p><p>“That’s not how they treat rabies. You get a shot of vaccine in the shoulder, then gamma globulin in the wound and in the hips or the butt. They’re no more painful than normal shots. But it doesn’t matter because I don’t need them.”</p><p>Dean sighed. “What’s the point of being the older brother if you can’t torture the younger one every once in a while? Besides, who says Frankenmutt is supernatural? You saw those scar lines, right? He looked like something a mad scientist slapped together from spare parts.”</p><p><em>“Frankenstein</em> was just a novel by Mary Shelley,” Sam said. “You ever read it?”</p><p>“I’ve seen all the movies,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam ignored him and went on. “Shelley wrote her novel in the early 1800s, long before the modern era of science. The procedure she wrote about is pure fiction. It could never work in the real world. You can’t make a single body out of a bunch of separate parts. Forget about trying to hook up the central nervous system, the problems with tissue rejection alone...” Sam trailed off when he realized Dean was staring at him. “What?”</p><p>“I thought you went to law school, not medical school.”</p><p>“My point is that whatever Frankenmutt is, it’s not a product of science.”</p><p>“All right, I’ll take your word for it, Dr. Dorkwad.”</p><p>Sam had been standing as they talked, and his ankle was starting to throb. He also felt suddenly tired. Maybe he’d lost more blood than he thought. He hobbled over to one of the beds and sat down. Dean watched him closely as he walked, and although he frowned, he said nothing about Sam’s injury, and Sam was grateful.</p><p>“Did you find anything on the Net?” he asked.</p><p>“Other than stuff about the movie <em>Frankenweenie,</em> no.” He closed the laptop and sat back in the chair. “Man, I can’t get over how fast that thing was. The way it looked, it should’ve had trouble just walking, but it moved faster than a cheetah on meth.”</p><p>“Not at the end,” Sam pointed out. “After I shot it in the head, it took off, but it didn’t move much faster than an ordinary dog. And it moved in a zigzaggy kind of way, like it was having trouble staying on its feet.”</p><p>“That’s because you wounded it. If you were missing half your head, you wouldn’t be moving very fast either.”</p><p>“It shouldn’t have been moving at all, but the injury only slowed it down, and I think I know why.”</p><p>“Let me guess. It was full of life energy after killing Joyce and Ted, which is why it could move so damn fast, but its needle dropped to E after you shot it, and it had just enough left in the tank to make a getaway.”</p><p>“That’s my take on it,” Sam said. A wave of weariness came over him, and he stifled a yawn. What was wrong with him? It wasn’t even five o’clock yet, and he felt ready to hit the sack.</p><p>“It’ll do till a better theory comes along. So whatever this thing is, it’s still just your basic supernatural freak show, only with more emphasis on the freak this time. How do you figure all those dog parts came together, though? Maybe we should check the town for a pet cemetery. Or it could be some kind of group ghost, a whole pack of doggie spirits, and I should’ve blasted it with rock salt after all.”</p><p>Sam fought another yawn. “It still could be a Frankenmutt, only one created by magic instead of science. I’ll see what I can dig up about spells that are supposed to... fuse body parts... together.” This time he couldn’t fight the yawn, and he fell back onto the bed without bothering to get under the covers. “After I take a nap.”</p><p>“Hey, Sam, are you o–”</p><p>That’s the last he heard before a warm, wonderful darkness gathered him up and swept him away.</p><p>* * *</p><p>In the parking lot outside the Winchesters’ room, a figure stood. There was no one around, but even if there had been, they wouldn’t have seen him. Not unless he wished it. A gentle breeze was blowing, but even though it caressed his skin, he didn’t feel it.</p><p>Even from here, he could sense the injury that had been done to Sam Winchester, both the physical component and the spiritual. Of the two, the latter was far more serious.</p><p><em>This isn’t good,</em> he thought. <em>Not good at all.</em> But all he could do was stand here and continue to watch.</p><p>For the moment, at least.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Catherine Luss tossed the <em>Broadsider</em> onto the kitchen counter. It was yesterday’s edition, but she’d been so busy working that she’d had no chance to look at it before. The headline screamed off the front page in large black letters:</p><p><strong>TWO MORE FOUND DEAD IN</strong></p><p><strong>MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES!</strong></p><p>She’d only gotten partway through the lead story before she hadn’t been able to read any further. She hadn’t known either Ted Boykin or Joyce Nagrosky. Both had retired before Bekah started high school, and neither had been among her patients. She also hadn’t known the two previous victims—a gas station attendant named Randy Neff and a teenage girl named Angela Bales. She thought Bekah might’ve known Angela, or at least been aware of her, as they’d been close in age, but she didn’t know, and it wasn’t as if she could ask her daughter. Not anymore.</p><p>She’d poured herself a cup of coffee with half-and-half and artificial sweetener before sitting down at the counter for what she’d hoped would be a relaxing—and badly needed—break from work. The time readout on the microwave said it was 5:12, but until she’d looked out the window, she hadn’t known whether that was a.m. or p.m. She wondered how long she’d been down in the lab this time, and was surprised to discover she didn’t know. Twenty-four hours? Forty-eight? Did it even matter?</p><p>What did matter was that headline, or rather the four lost lives behind it. The story was short on facts and long on hysteria-fueled supposition, speculating that the deaths were caused by anything from a previously unknown super bug to toxic waste or radiation—despite the fact that Brennan had no industry that could have produced either of the latter. She was surprised the reporter hadn’t blamed the deaths on UFOs while he’d been at it. But she knew exactly who was ultimately responsible for those poor people’s deaths.</p><p>She was.</p><p>The temperature in the kitchen seemed to drop several degrees. Catherine was wearing a white lab coat over a gray pullover sweater with a thick collar, but she still shivered. She felt the cold as much inside as out.</p><p>“It’s not your fault.”</p><p>The voice was soft, little more than a whisper, really, with a slight accent that she thought might be German, although she wasn’t sure. A subtle odor drifted to her on the air, a musty smell like a just-opened cedar chest that had been closed for a very long time. She took a sip of her coffee and half turned on the stool to face Conrad.</p><p>Even though she’d been working with him for the past few months, she still had to struggle to keep an expression of distaste from showing every time she looked at him. It wasn’t that he was hideous. He was rather pleasant-looking, actually, if on the plain side. A thin man in his early sixties, he stood no more than five-foot-five and had a large nose contrasted by small, almost feminine lips and a narrow chin. His hairline had receded well past his forehead, but the hair that remained to him was brown and thick, without a hint of gray. His most striking feature, however, was his large penetrating eyes. They rested beneath thick black eyebrows, and their color was indeterminate, seeming to change depending on the light. Sometimes they were dark blue, sometimes charcoal gray, and other times almost black. As always, he wore a suit, this one brown with an ivory shirt and gold tie—stylish and retro at the same time. It wasn’t his appearance that Catherine found distasteful, nor was it the way he tended to remain statue-still until he decided to move. What bothered her was something more indefinable, his... presence, she supposed you could call it. He exuded an aura that she found repellent in the same way that magnets of opposite charge pushed against each other. Whenever he approached, she felt an urge to back away, to keep as much distance between them as possible. He did nothing overt to intimidate her, but she had to fight to hold her ground whenever they were in the same room together—which these days they often were.</p><p>She ran her hand through her short blonde hair, suddenly aware of how greasy it was. She was in dire need of a shower. She hated to think what she smelled like, and she probably had the world’s worst case of dragon breath from all the coffee she’d been drinking. Working alongside Conrad down in the lab, she never thought about such things. If she did stink, he never gave any sign that he noticed, let alone was bothered by, her body odor. But up here, in what she thought of as the Real World, she was painfully aware of her lack of hygiene.</p><p>“Tell that to the families of the four people who died,” she responded. “I took an oath, Conrad.”</p><p><em>“Primum non nocere:</em> First, do no harm,” Conrad said. “I am familiar with the Hippocratic Oath.” He gave her a slight, almost amused smile, but otherwise stood completely still, his hands at his sides. From the neck down, he might as well have been a mannequin.</p><p>“It’s my fault it escaped,” she said.</p><p><em>“Our</em> fault,” he corrected. “We both thought the cage you had me purchase would be of sufficient strength to contain the beast. I am only grateful that you were at your practice when it made its bid for freedom. Otherwise, it surely would have attempted to feed on you.”</p><p>What a mess the damned thing had made in its escape, too. The damage to the lab hadn’t been so bad, since the creature headed straight for the stairs after tearing free from its cage, but it knocked down the basement door and raced around the house as it searched for a way out—shredding her furniture with tooth and claw in frustrated rage—before finally crashing through the back door. Luckily, it had happened in the early evening and had been dark enough by then that none of her neighbors had seen the beast as it fled. It also helped that she lived on several acres of land outside town. If she’d lived in a suburb, somebody surely would have spotted the monstrous dog running from her house and called the police. In that case, she’d probably be in jail right now, her medical license suspended. If she’d lived in an earlier age, she’d likely have been burned at the stake. She still could be, she supposed. The people of Brennan weren’t exactly the most educated or progressive in the state.</p><p>Even though she found being in Conrad’s presence difficult, Catherine was thankful for his assistance. He’d taken care of everything, buying and installing two new doors, as well as removing the worst of the damaged furniture and hauling it away. He’d even offered to replace her lost furniture, but she’d declined. She spent most of her time down in the lab, and it wasn’t as if anyone else lived in the house. Not anymore.</p><p>She held her mug in both hands and looked down at the coffee within. “Maybe it would’ve been better if I had been here,” she said softly.</p><p>Conrad stepped forward. For a moment she feared he meant to reach out and touch her, perhaps give her upper arm a reassuring squeeze or lay a comforting hand on her shoulder. She tensed, hoping that if he did she would be able to keep from screaming. As if sensing her discomfort, Conrad took a step back and kept his hands at his sides.</p><p>“You shouldn’t speak like that,” he admonished mildly. “The beast’s escape and the lives subsequently lost are regrettable, yes, but I must remind you of the larger concern here. If you achieve your goal, not only shall you reap personal reward, you will change the world forever. Untold billions of lives will be saved, and the human lifespan itself will be extended. It is impossible to say just how long people will live in the new world your work will bring about, but virtual immortality is not out of the question. Isn’t the attainment of such a goal—“</p><p>“Worth four people’s lives?” she interrupted. She looked up at him, jaw tight with anger.</p><p>Conrad’s eyes narrowed, but his voice remained even as he replied. “Something for which those people would willingly sacrifice themselves.”</p><p>“Considering we can’t ask them, we’re never going to know for sure, are we?”</p><p>They were both silent for a time after that. Catherine sipped her coffee and tried to ignore how Conrad just stood there, quiet and statue-still.</p><p>After a while, he said, “You will not abandon your work.” It was part question, part command.</p><p>She finished the last of her coffee and sighed. “No, I won’t.”</p><p>Conrad gave her a slow smile.</p><p><em>That’s the way a lizard would smile,</em> she thought.</p><p>“Good. Now, is there any service I may perform for you?”</p><p>Sometimes she found his formal manner charming. Other times, like now, she found it cold and distant.</p><p>“We could use some...” She looked down, unable to meet his gaze. “Fresh supplies.”</p><p>His lizard smile returned. “It will be my pleasure.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After Conrad left, Catherine was able to relax a little. While she was grateful for both the tutelage and assistance he’d provided over the past few months, she was always on edge when he was around. There was something indefinably wrong about him that set off alarm bells in the back of her mind. Beyond his appearance and manner—and aside from what she suspected he did in order to procure more “supplies” for her work—he drew in the energy of his surroundings, as if he were some kind of living black hole. Light, heat, even her own vitality seemed to drain into him, and she felt weary after spending any length of time in his presence. His departure always came as a relief. She was never able to fully relax when Conrad was in the house, and now that he was gone, she knew she should try to lie down and get some sleep. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d gotten any decent rest, let alone a full eight hours.</p><p>As a doctor, she well understood the effects of sleep deprivation, both physical and mental. Logically, she knew that she couldn’t do her best work if she didn’t take care of herself. <em>You have to take care of the machine,</em> as she always told her patients. Used to tell. The way she’d neglected her practice the last few months, it was all but dead. But that was a small price to pay to achieve her ultimate goal. She would give anything, <em>do</em> anything, to make it happen.</p><p>Conrad’s question—which she’d both interrupted and completed—came back to her.</p><p><em>Isn’t the attainment of such a goal worth four people’s lives?</em></p><p>She didn’t want to think like that. She was supposed to be a healer, for Christ’s sake! But despite her protestations to Conrad, she couldn’t deny that deep down she <em>did think</em> that way. She wasn’t proud of the fact, but there it was. However, even though she knew how important it was to get her rest, emotionally she found it almost impossible to tear herself away from her work. About the only time she slowed down was to make a fresh pot of coffee, and she justified that to herself only because she needed the caffeine to keep her alert. She couldn’t afford to slow down. She had to keep pushing herself. They were depending on her.</p><p>She was no psychologist, but she had done a psych rotation in med school, and she knew that while it was vital to keep pushing herself if she hoped to succeed, there was another, deeper reason she refused to slow down. If she kept her mind busy, she didn’t have time to think about anything but work. It was when she allowed herself to rest that she remembered—or worse, dreamed.</p><p>She finished her coffee, got up from the table, and poured herself a refill. She headed back to the table, but instead of taking her seat again, she set the mug down, then walked past the kitchen, down a short hallway off to the left, and entered the family room. The lights were off, as they always were these days. She never went in there anymore, so there was no point in wasting electricity. She reached for the wall switch, but couldn’t find it. She couldn’t have forgotten where it was... could she? This was her <em>home.</em> She should be able to remember something as basic as the location of a light switch. She fumbled in the dark for several moments before her fingers finally encountered it and she flipped it with a sharp gesture of irritation, although inside she felt more than a little relief.</p><p>The illumination from the track lighting over the couch dazzled her eyes for a second, and she raised a hand to shield them. When her vision adjusted, she lowered her hand and saw that the room looked the same as always, with the exception of a light coating of dust on the cherrywood coffee table and the black leather couch. It almost looked like the room was covered with a thin layer of snow. No, she decided, it was more like she was looking at a faded photograph. A large flatscreen TV hung on the wall above the fireplace. The latter was empty and cold, but there used to be flames in there almost every night, even in summer. On the mantel above the fireplace beneath the television were a number of framed pictures. As Catherine stood there, she experienced the strange feeling that she was somehow trespassing in her own home.</p><p>She crossed the crème-colored carpet and stopped in front of the mantel. The first photo she picked up was one of her and Marshall on their wedding day. Both of them were laughing at something the photographer had said—she couldn’t remember what. It was her favorite picture of the two of them. The joy they exuded in that frozen moment perfectly captured the essence of their relationship. Love was only part of it, although of course, the largest part. They had genuinely enjoyed each other’s company, too. Some couples said they were also best friends, but in their case, it had been true. Marshall looked so handsome in the photo, and so young. They’d been in their early twenties when they married, but even so, the man he would become was visible. Thinner, a bit more hair, but the playful intelligence was present in his brown eyes, and it would only sharpen as the years progressed. And his smile... God, how she missed it.</p><p>She placed the picture back on the mantel and picked up another, this one of a pretty teenage girl with long brown hair, dressed in a tie-dyed T-shirt and shorts, sitting on the ground surrounding by flowers. Catherine had taken this picture of Bekah herself in the spring, out in the garden. She and Bekah had spent so many wonderful hours planning, planting, and tending the garden. It had been so long since she’d gone out back, she didn’t want to think about the kind of condition it was in. She supposed it was nothing but a tangle of high grass and weeds.</p><p>She remembered exactly when she’d taken this picture of Bekah. Eight days before her fifteenth birthday. Nine days before she’d gotten her learner’s permit. Twenty-three days before her father took her out for her first night-time driving lesson. That had been four months ago. It was the last time Catherine had seen either of them alive.</p><p>She didn’t recall much about the night itself after seeing them off. She assumed the police called her at one point, and she must have called someone after that, because she had a vague memory of sobbing in someone’s arms. She thought it might have been Ronetta, her office manager, but she wasn’t certain.</p><p>The details of what had happened to her husband and daughter, though, those she remembered, or at least could imagine, perfectly.</p><p>At approximately 8:40, Marshall and Bekah—in Marshall’s BMW, Bekah behind the wheel, excited and nervous—approached a railroad crossing outside of town. They got there just as the warning lights came on and the wooden crossing gate lowered. Bekah braked and together she and her father waited while the train passed. Over the months since, Catherine had wondered what, if anything, they’d talked about. She was certain no music had been playing. As much as Bekah would have loved to cruise to some tunes, her dad would never have permitted such a distraction while she was in the early stages of her driver’s education. She thought they might’ve rolled down the windows so they could better listen to the sound of the train’s passage and feel the wind it kicked up. She imagined them looking at each other, grinning and sharing a special moment, just the two of them, father and daughter.</p><p>The train passed, the crossing gate lifted, and Bekah took her foot off the brake, gently pressed the gas, and eased over the tracks, looking both ways as the BMW juddered across. Once safely on the other side, Bekah accelerated. An instant later a pickup with its lights off came flying out of the darkness, weaving back and forth, its driver one Earl Fulmer, a local plumber who’d just left a poker game at a buddy’s house, running with more alcohol than blood in his veins. Earl hit Bekah and Marshall head-on at what the police estimated was in excess of seventy miles per hour. There were no survivors.</p><p>As a doctor, Catherine knew her husband and daughter had died quickly, and despite the horrific injuries they’d sustained, they hadn’t suffered. At least, not for long. But even though she knew this intellectually, emotionally she imagined their experience of the accident as very different. She knew that human perceptions became heightened during times of extreme stress, giving rise to the common belief that a person’s life flashes before their eyes at such times. She imagined the accident seeming to occur in torturous slow motion while Marshall and Bekah’s consciousnesses operated at normal speed. If that were true, every wound they suffered would have seemed to take an eternity to inflict. The agony would have been inconceivable. She knew it was a foolish scenario to imagine, one that had no firm basis in scientific facts, but in her heart she believed it to be true, so she grieved not only for the loss of her loved ones, but for the unimaginable suffering they had endured before finally dying.</p><p>She looked at Bekah’s photo one last time, brushing the tip of her index finger across her daughter’s hair, feeling only cold glass. She replaced the picture on the mantel and walked out of the room, flipping off the light switch as she went. She passed through the kitchen, ignoring the coffee, opened the basement door, and headed down the stairs.</p><p>In the first days after the accident, Catherine had wished she’d ridden along with Marshall and Bekah that night. Wished she’d died with them. But that was before the morning Conrad Dippel visited her office, not as a patient, but as what he called a “potential colleague.” He said he’d read about her “lamentable loss” in the <em>Broadsider,</em> and had what he believed might be a solution to her “profound emotional distress.” She’d almost tossed him out on his ass right there and then, but there was something in the tone of his voice, an unwavering confidence that made her want to listen to what he had to say, regardless of how crazy it might sound. Conrad had more than words with which to convince her, too. He’d brought a briefcase filled with the results of hundreds of experiments. The data had been intriguing, but nowhere near as intriguing as the demonstration he gave her in the temporary lab he’d established in the abandoned bicycle factory.</p><p>She’d watched him kill a rat by cutting its throat, stitch it up, and then—after administrating a combination of chemicals to the small corpse, in conjunction with some chanted words and hand gestures that she was certain were just for show—bring the animal back to life.</p><p>At that point, Conrad Dippel moved from “potential colleague” to a fully-fledged one.</p><p>Catherine had left the fluorescent lights on when she’d exited the basement, and had no trouble making her way across the lab. Much of the equipment was Conrad’s, transferred from the bicycle factory, but she’d added to it over the previous few months. A stainless steel operating table stood in the center of the basement, an array of surgical equipment laid out atop a table close by. Another table contained vials, jars, and beakers filled with various chemicals, along with other necessary equipment: pipettes, scales, microscopes, slides, and more. Stored on the floor beneath the table were several plastic containers labeled NuFlesh Biotech. Catherine ignored everything and crossed to the large horizontal freezer on the far side of the room. The machine’s powerful hum filled the basement, and she could feel its vibrations through the soles of her feet as she approached. She reached toward its metal surface, the cold kissing her skin before her fingers came in contact with the metal.</p><p>“I won’t rest until we’re together again,” she said in a soft, loving voice. “I promise.”</p><p>She lingered there a moment longer before turning away and once more resuming her work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Hey, Joe. What’s the word?”</p><p>Joe Riley sat on the curb outside the Fill ‘Er Up convenience store. He’d just finished eating an energy bar, and now was nursing a cup of brown water that the store manager had the gall to call coffee. But it was warm, and that was all he cared about. He looked up as Billy Sutphin approached and gave him a weak smile.</p><p>“Sucks is the word. How ‘bout you?”</p><p>“Same.”</p><p>Billy settled onto the curb next to Joe with a grunt, knee joints popping.</p><p>“Gettin’ old,” Billy said.</p><p>“Aren’t we all?”</p><p>Joe didn’t think Billy was all that old. In his mid-fifties, maybe. It was hard to tell people’s ages when they lived on the street. Such a life took its toll, and it was possible Billy could be in his thirties and only looked twenty years older. It didn’t help that his thick brown beard was shot through with gray. Joe had only been homeless for four months, and even in that short time, he’d changed to the point where he didn’t like looking in a mirror. His face was leaner, complexion sallower, eyes bloodshot, the flesh beneath puffy and bruised-looking. He did his best to keep his teeth clean, but they’d yellowed, and one of the bottom left molars ached all the time. He figured he probably had a cavity. Too bad he didn’t have enough money for a dentist.</p><p>Joe wasn’t well acquainted with Billy, but Brennan wasn’t a large town, and its homeless population tended to know one another at least well enough to say hi and shoot the shit now and again. They also tended to keep an eye on one another, make sure folks were doing okay, staying healthy, both physically and mentally. They called this “checking in,” and Joe recognized that was what Billy was doing now. There was also a certain kind of networking that went on among Brennan’s homeless. Tips were passed along—which church was giving away secondhand clothes, which buildings were vacant and good for a few nights of sheltered sleep before the cops rousted everyone out. Vital information if you wanted to survive on the street.</p><p>“Tried my luck at the highway exit today,” Billy said. “Stood there all afternoon holding a ‘will work for food’ sign.” He shivered.</p><p>Homeless folk knew to dress in layers when it was cold, and Billy wore a shirt and hoodie beneath an unzipped parka. But even with his limited experience, Joe knew that no matter how warmly you dressed, you could never keep the cold entirely at bay. Hell, he was dressed in layers too, only he had on his Dad’s old army jacket instead of a parka, and he felt the night’s chill. It was why he’d gotten the coffee in the first place. He offered Billy a sip to warm him up, but Billy declined with a shake of his head. It was too easy to pass germs that way, and homeless folk avoided getting sick at all costs. Joe felt stupid for forgetting that.</p><p>“How did it go?” he asked.</p><p>Billy shrugged. “‘Bout as well as you’d expect. I need to shave off this damned beard. Makes me look too scary, you know? People don’t want to stop and open their windows to talk to a guy that looks like some kind of backwoods killer out of a horror movie. You’re smart to keep yourself cleanshaven. Men look less intimidating that way.”</p><p>Maybe so, but Joe’s first winter being homeless was approaching, and he figured he’d better start working on a beard if he wanted to keep warm. He finished the rest of his coffee, sat the empty cup on the ground, then lit a cigarette. He offered one to Billy, and this time the man accepted. They sat in silence for a few moments, smoking and watching cars pass by on the street, some of the drivers pulling into Fill ‘Er Up to get gas or pick up some items inside. Joe noticed that Billy’s hands shook as he smoked, and there was something about the way they trembled that didn’t look like it was due to the cold, or at least, not only the cold. As far as Joe knew, the guy wasn’t into alcohol or drugs, so he wasn’t going through withdrawal. Joe hoped he wasn’t coming down with something.</p><p>“How was your day?” Billy asked after a bit.</p><p>“Not very productive.”</p><p>“Where did you try? You know what they say, it’s all about location, location, location.”</p><p>Joe thought about lying, but he didn’t see any point to it. Pride—foolish pride, anyway—was useless on the street. “I didn’t try. I just walked around town most of the day, moving from one place to another. Thinking.”</p><p>Billy took a last drag on his cigarette, dropped it to the ground, and crushed it out beneath the sole of his running shoe. He then turned to Joe. “I know it’s hard, man. I’ve been homeless for almost four years now, and it still ain’t easy for me to ask folks for money. But sometimes we have to do things we don’t like to survive, you know? You can’t let your pride get in the way. It’s like a Buddhist thing. You have to die to the self in order to reach enlightenment.”</p><p>Joe had no idea what the man was talking about, but he understood the basic sentiment.</p><p>“Sometimes it feels like pride’s the only thing I got left.” Joe finished his cigarette and crushed it out.</p><p>He’d had a good job working for the county, driving a snow plow in the winter and doing road work in the summer. He liked being outdoors—he wasn’t the sit-behind-a-desk type—and he liked feeling that the work he did helped make people’s lives a little easier. Then the lousy economy forced the county to make some budget cuts, and Joe was laid off. A week later his wife filed for divorce, took their little girl, and moved to her mother’s in Ash Creek. He hadn’t been able to afford a lawyer, so Sheila ended up with sole custody of their daughter, and he’d ended up paying both child and spousal support. He’d looked for other work—every damned day he looked—but no one was hiring. Eventually his unemployment ran out, the bank foreclosed on his home, he lost his car, and the next thing he knew, he became a resident of the street. He told himself it was temporary, just until he could get back on his proverbial feet. That had been four months ago, and he was still here, a victim not of booze, drugs, or mental illness—just plain old lousy luck. He’d adjusted as best he could, but the one thing he hadn’t been able to accept was asking strangers for money. It was one thing to be homeless, but it was another thing to be a beggar. Not that he’d ever use that word in front of Billy. He’d been on the street too long to make judgments about what others did to survive. He had no idea what the man’s story was and how he’d ended up living like this. That kind of personal information was kept to one’s self on the street, shared only with the closest of confidants. But whatever Billy’s story was, Joe knew the man had one. Everyone did.</p><p>“Tell you what,” Billy said, “I managed to score a few dollars today. How about we head on over to the Foxhole for a couple slices of pie? My treat.”</p><p>“I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but I don’t need cheering up. Besides, if I have a hard time taking charity from strangers, what makes you think I’ll have an easier time taking it from you?”</p><p>Billy grinned. “You got to start somewhere, right? C’mon.” He took hold of Joe’s upper arm and stood. Joe allowed the man to lift him to his feet.</p><p>“Well... it <em>has</em> been a while since I’ve had a good piece of pie.”</p><p>Billy clapped him on the back. “There you go!”</p><p>The two men started walking in the direction of the diner, taking alleys for short cuts. Not only did alleys save time, but you could find some good stuff in them. Discarded or lost objects you might be able to sell for a couple bucks, even cast-off clothing sometimes. Sure, alleys could be dark and intimidating, and they didn’t smell all that good, but they were useful, and when you were homeless, that was all that mattered.</p><p>They were only a block away from the Foxhole, walking through an alley between a coin-operated laundry and pizza joint when Joe had the feeling they were being followed. Before he’d become homeless, he might’ve ignored the sensation, figuring it was just his imagination. Who didn’t walk through an alley with their guard up? But during his relatively short time on the street, Joe’s survival instincts had been sharpened, and he knew better than to dismiss any feeling, no matter how trivial it seemed. He gripped Billy’s upper arm to stop him, and then glanced back over his shoulder. He honestly didn’t expect to see anything, so it was a shock when he saw the figure standing behind them. It was even more of a shock to see the large, cruel-looking knife clutched in the man’s hand. <em>Was the blade black?</em> It sure looked that way to Joe.</p><p>“Good evening, gentleman,” the man said. “My apologies, but you both have something I need, and I’m afraid I’m going to have to take it from you. I assure you, this is nothing personal, and if it’s any consolation, know that your sacrifice will not only help further the cause of science, it will also help bring about a most glorious change unlike any the world has ever seen.”</p><p>Joe turned to Billy. “Do you have any idea what the hell he’s—“</p><p>That was as far as he got before the man with the knife sprang at them.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dispatching the men was accomplished easily enough. A pair of quick, deep slices to the throat, and all Conrad had to do was step back as the men fell to the ground and wait for them to bleed out. He had no aversion to cutting into still-living bodies, but he preferred not to get any more blood on him than necessary. It didn’t take long for their blood flow to diminish, and then Conrad went to work. He selected the clean-shaven man first, judging him to be younger than his bearded companion and likely in better condition. He raised his obsidian blade over his head, and the runes engraved upon it glowed with silver-blue light.</p><p>“In your name, my lady.”</p><p>Then he crouched next to the body and went to work.</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Blood was everywhere—on the walls, the floor, the furniture, even the ceiling. It looked as if someone had carried in large buckets of the red stuff and splashed it all over the living room, taking pains to make sure that no surface was left untouched. There was so much blood that at first Sam couldn’t see anything but crimson. Then a second later, his eyes registered the two forms on the floor in front of the couch, one lying prone, the other straddling it. Both were covered with so much gore that he didn’t recognize them right away. The one on the floor was larger, taller, and beefier than the other. Sam thought it might be a man, but given the state of the figure’s face—or rather what little was left of it—he couldn’t tell for sure. The flannel shirt and jeans didn’t help much, but the large boots were a giveaway. They were Earl’s, which made sense, considering the cabin was his as well. His left hand was clenched around a small black object which Sam immediately recognized as a statuette of Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead.</p><p>The figure straddling Earl’s chest was thinner, shorter, and dressed in a blood-soaked T-shirt and a pair of cut-off shorts. The long hair was so matted with blood, it was impossible to determine its true color by sight, but Sam knew it was a light chestnut brown. He also knew that the hair normally smelled of strawberry kiwi shampoo. He didn’t want to think about how it smelled right now.</p><p><em>Trish.</em></p><p>He hadn’t spoken her name aloud—at least, he didn’t think he had—but her gaze snapped in his direction. Her blue eyes were as empty and cold as the bottom of an arctic sea, and there was nothing remotely human in them. She had something wet and ragged clamped between her blood-slick teeth, and Sam’s stomach did a flip when he realized it was part of her father’s tongue. She tossed her head back and swallowed the grisly morsel in a single gulp, and then locked gazes with him once again. Her lips drew back from her teeth in a gesture that was more rictus than smile. She rose to her feet and stepped away from her father’s body. She moved toward Sam with the feral grace of a jungle cat, and a low keening sound came from deep in her throat. It was the sound of need, of desire, of <em>hunger.</em></p><p><em>This isn’t right,</em> Sam thought. <em>It didn’t happen like this!</em></p><p>It was the last thought he had before Trish sank her teeth into his throat.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Sam? <em>Sam!”</em></p><p>He sat up and opened his eyes, surprised by how much effort it took. Dean’s hands were on his shoulders, and Sam realized his brother had been shaking him.</p><p>He pushed Dean’s hands away and then yawned. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Dean had been sitting on the edge of the bed, but now he stood. “You were moaning and thrashing in your sleep, big time. You must’ve been having one hell of a serious dream, and not the good kind, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Sam rubbed his eyes. He didn’t remember falling asleep. “What time is it?” He glanced toward the nightstand and checked the read-out on the digital clock there: 9:13. “Wow, I must’ve been wiped out. I napped for... what, three hours or so?”</p><p>Dean walked over to the window and drew back the curtains. Light spilled into the room and stabbed Sam’s eyes. His head pounded as if he had a hangover, and he lifted a hand to block the glare as he averted his gaze.</p><p>“You slept a little longer than that, Rip Van Winkle. It’s nine in the morning.”</p><p>He’d slept for fifteen hours. Most of the time, Dean and he were lucky to get four hours a night, but every once in a while the lack of rest caught up with them and they crashed for the better part of a day. “Guess I needed to get caught up on my sleep. Sorry.”</p><p>He sat up the rest of the way and swung his feet over the side of the bed. He winced as his right foot touched the carpet, and he remembered his wound. That memory brought the rest along with it—Brennan, the mummified corpses, Frankenmutt—and he was jolted fully awake.</p><p>He looked around the room, trying to appear casual as he checked to make sure that everything was the way it should be. He had a hard time telling what was real and what wasn’t these days, especially when he’d just awakened, or was tired or stressed. But he didn’t see any hallucinations—none that were obvious, at any rate—and when after a few moments the room, the furniture, and Dean remained the same, he allowed himself to relax.</p><p>“Any coffee?” he asked.</p><p>Dean walked over to the table where a couple coffee cups from a fast-food joint sat. He brought one to Sam, then went back and took a seat. The brothers sipped their go-juice for a few moments in silence before Dean asked, “So what were you dreaming about? And if it <em>was</em> the good kind of dream, make sure you don’t leave out any naughty details.”</p><p>At first Sam couldn’t remember what he’d been dreaming about, but then the details came flooding back, and he wished they hadn’t.</p><p>“Trish.”</p><p>Dean arced an eyebrow in surprise. “Trish Hansen?”</p><p>Sam nodded and took another sip of coffee. It seemed sharp and acidic as it went down his throat, and his stomach roiled in response.</p><p>“That was a while ago,” Dean said softly. “We were teenagers.”</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>They were silent for a few moments after that, both continuing to work on their coffee.</p><p>After a bit, Dean asked, “Why do you suppose you dreamed about her?” He didn’t look at Sam as he spoke, but there was a clear edge of tension in his voice.</p><p>“I don’t know. I guess I’ve just been thinking about death lately.”</p><p>Dean turned to him, a hard expression on his face that verged on anger. “Lately? In case you haven’t noticed, Death could be both of our middle names. If we aren’t ganking some monster, we’re watching someone we love go belly up.”</p><p><em>Someone like Bobby,</em> Sam thought, although he didn’t say it aloud. “That’s kind of what I mean. Death is so much a part of our lives that sometimes we take it for granted...” He hurried on before Dean could protest. “Until something happens to remind us. In a lot of ways, what happened to Trish was the first time I realized just how close death really is to all of us. Not just hunters, but everybody. It’s always there, just a heartbeat away, waiting for the right time, you know?”</p><p>Dean nodded gravely. “Yes. Yes, I do.”</p><p><em>Of course you do,</em> Sam thought. For a short time, Dean had actually served as a stand-in for Death with a capital D.</p><p>Sam went on. “Besides, we were talking about <em>Frankenstein</em> yesterday, so that’s another probable reason I was thinking about death—at least subconsciously—as I conked out.”</p><p>“Yeah. Probably.” Dean’s tone was distant, distracted, and Sam knew that he was remembering Trish. Remembering how she died... and remembering the horrible thing she had become in death.</p><p>Sam wanted to take Dean’s mind—and his own—off Trish Hansen, so he put his almost-empty coffee cup on the nightstand and stood, trying not to grimace as he put weight on his injured ankle. It hurt, but not as bad as it had yesterday. “So, any new developments regarding Frankenmutt while I was zonked?” he asked.</p><p>“Not so fast there, pilgrim,” Dean said.</p><p>“Pilgrim?”</p><p>“Caught a cowboy flick on TV last night while you were off in dreamland,” Dean said, sounding a bit apologetic. “Anyway, before we get back to work, I want to take a look at that ankle of yours.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“We don’t know exactly what the hell Frankenmutt is, and after the way you passed out last night, I want to make sure that you didn’t pick up something nasty when he bit you.”</p><p>“I didn’t pass out,” Sam muttered. “I fell asleep.”</p><p>Dean had eased up on the overprotective big brother bit over the last couple years, but he still got on Sam’s nerves whenever he fell back into his old role. Still, Sam couldn’t fault his brother’s reasoning, and besides, he knew Dean wouldn’t let up until he was satisfied.</p><p>“Whatever. Let’s take a look at that ankle and make sure you didn’t catch Frankenrabies.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Sam sat on the foot of his bed and crossed his right leg onto his left. He’d fallen asleep in his clothes, and by longstanding agreement between the brothers, Dean had left him that way. He’d taken his shoes off before bandaging his ankle the night before, though, so all he needed to do was pull up the pant leg a little and begin unwrapping the bandage. Dean rose from the table and walked over to the bed to get a closer look at the wound.</p><p>“You’re hovering,” Sam said.</p><p>“Deal with it,” Dean replied.</p><p>Sam finished removing the bandage and was gratified to see the wound looked greatly improved since yesterday. It wasn’t bleeding anymore and scabs had already started to form. The tissue around the wound wasn’t swollen, nor was it red, but he probed it with his fingertips to be sure. The flesh was tender, but it felt cool: no infection.</p><p>“I gotta admit, it looks pretty good,” Dean said.</p><p>“So no more worries about Frankenrabies?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>Sam started to rewrap the wound, but then decided to let it breathe for a while.</p><p>“As I was saying, anything new?”</p><p>“Not really. No mysterious wasting deaths were reported, so it looks like Frankenmutt didn’t drain anyone’s battery last night. I researched black dogs some more on the net, but didn’t find anything we don’t already know. I also looked into Brennan’s history, but near as I can tell, until recently nothing even remotely supernatural has ever happened here. When it comes to the wide world of weird, this may be the least interesting town in the whole damn country. Hell, I’m thinking about retiring here some day.”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Assuming we get rid of Frankenmutt first.”</p><p>“And the Double-Header.”</p><p>Sam frowned. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Dean grinned, then went back to the table and turned on the laptop. Sam hobbled over, and since there was only one chair, Dean made him take it. Dean looked over his shoulder as the screen came to life and displayed the webpage for the <em>Broadsider.</em> The headline read Local Unemployment Reaches All-Time High.</p><p>“Scroll down,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam did so, and toward the bottom of the page, he found a smaller headline: Man Reports Encounter with Two-Headed Monster. The headline was only a link, so Sam clicked it and an instant later, the entire article was displayed on the screen.</p><p><strong>MAN REPORTS ENCOUNTER WITH TWO-HEADED MONSTER</strong></p><blockquote><p>Late last evening, Brennan resident Lyle Swanson called 911 to report that what he referred to as a “monster” was raiding the trash containers behind his house. When Brennan police arrived at the Swanson residence, they discovered several trash containers had been overturned and their contents scattered, but they found no evidence of who or what was responsible. When the police spoke with Mr. Swanson, he described hearing noises outside, and when he looked through his back door window to investigate, he saw a creature that resembled a “large naked man with two heads and four arms” going through his trash and “eating all the good stuff.” Police took Mr. Swanson’s statement and suggested he purchase trash containers with locking mechanisms to prevent a recurrence of the incident.</p></blockquote><p>Dean chuckled. “Man, I don’t know what Lyle was drinking last night, but I’ll have a double.”</p><p>Sam looked over his shoulder at his brother. “You don’t think what he saw was real?”</p><p>Dean frowned. “C’mon, Sammy. I only wanted you to see this so you’d get a laugh out of it. I didn’t think you’d take it seriously.” His eyes narrowed as if he was suddenly suspicious of something, and Sam knew he was worried that his little brother’s crazy was starting to show again.</p><p>“Think about it,” Sam said. “Frankenmutt looked like he was a combination of different dog parts, right? So maybe this Double-Header is the same kind of thing, only he’s a combination of different <em>people.”</em></p><p>Dean regarded the computer screen for a moment then turned his attention back to Sam. He sighed.</p><p>“You grab a shower. I’ll track down Lyle’s address.”</p><p>Sam nodded, rose from the chair, and started toward the bathroom, almost shuffling as he went. He wondered when the coffee he’d had would finally kick in. Despite all the sleep he’d gotten, he felt so damn tired...</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean listened to the sound of the shower while he worked on digging up Lyle Swanson’s address. Sometimes living in close quarters with Sam got on his nerves, and he knew Sam felt the same way about him. What two brothers could spend almost every moment together and not irritate each other? It was normal human behavior, no harm, no foul. But he’d never told Sam that he often found the sounds of someone else close by—say, for instance, a running shower—comforting, even soothing. Footsteps across a floor, the scrape of a chair being pulled away from a table, the tapping of computer keys, the creak of bedsprings, the soft breathing of someone else sleeping. As Sam had pointed out, they spent so much of their time dealing with death. Being surrounded by simple day-to-day sounds, <em>human</em> sounds, helped remind Dean that there was life in the world, too, and that he wasn’t alone, not as long as he had family.</p><p>Dean found his thoughts drifting toward Trish Hansen. He hadn’t thought of her in years, but now that Sam had brought her up, Dean was having a hard time thinking about anything else. One year in their early teens, their dad had gotten a lead on a possible location of Yellow-Eyes, the demon that had killed their mother. Supposedly, the demon had been spotted by a hunter in Alaska, and John Winchester was hell-bent on running the bastard to ground and making him pay for what he’d done. But his desire for vengeance didn’t cloud his judgment, at least not where his sons were concerned. John wasn’t about to take Sam and Dean along on such a potentially dangerous hunt, so he’d arranged for them to stay with a friend in Washington State. Walter Hansen wasn’t a hunter himself, but a master forger who provided false documents and ID for hunters to use. He also ran something of an unofficial trading post, as some of his clients paid him in barter. Weapons were the most common alternate currency, but sometimes they paid with other, more... esoteric items that they acquired during the course of their work. Dean hadn’t cared much about any of that, however. At his age, the most important thing about Walter Hansen was that he had a teenage daughter named Trish.</p><p>He remembered the first time he saw her. Dad hadn’t told them that his friend had a daughter, so when Walter let them into his cabin one early spring evening, both Dean and Sam had been surprised to see a girl sitting cross-legged in front of the fireplace. She looked to be around his age, maybe a year older. Her complexion was light, her features delicate, and the brown hair that flowed over her shoulders seemed almost bronze in the firelight. Her gray sweater was big and baggy on her, but her faded jeans hugged her slender legs, giving Dean a tantalizing idea of what the rest of her body might look like. She wore no shoes, and she held her bare feet in her hands, as if the fire wasn’t enough to warm them. Later, he would take note of the playful intelligence that danced in her eyes, would feel a strange thrill in his chest whenever she let out one of her too-loud laughs. But what struck him most at that moment was the way she turned her head to look at them and smiled, big and bright, as if welcoming old friends instead of greeting a trio of strangers. It may well have been the best smile he’d ever seen on a woman.</p><p>“We good to go?”</p><p>Startled, Dean looked up from the laptop screen to see Sam standing by the table, hair a tousled wet mess, motel towel wrapped around his waist.</p><p>“Dude, I thought we had a rule about running around naked in front of each other.”</p><p>“I’m not naked.”</p><p>“Close enough. Get dressed, Towel Boy. I got Lyle’s addy. Found it in an online phone registry.” Dean closed the laptop.</p><p>“Good. When I was in the shower—“</p><p>Dean held up his hands. “Please! There are some things I do <em>not</em> need to know. What happens in the shower, stays in the shower.”</p><p>Sam sighed. “I was going to say that I had an idea how we can set a trap for Frankenmutt.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, that I do need to know. You can fill me in on the way to Lyle’s.”</p><p>As Sam finished getting ready, Dean sat back in the chair and did his best not to think about Trish Hansen.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“We’ve seen a lot of crazy over the years, but Lyle’s got a good shot at winning a special place in the Winchester Hall of Weird.”</p><p>The brothers were in the crapmobile, heading back to Arbor Vale Apartments after interviewing Lyle Swanson. Sam sipped a latte with two shots of espresso that he’d picked up at a coffee shop on the way. Normally, he was careful to limit his caffeine intake, but the meager boost he’d received from his morning cuppa had already faded, and now he felt like taking a nap. He hoped he wasn’t coming down with something. Killing monsters was hard enough without having to do it while coughing, sneezing, and dripping snot.</p><p>“It didn’t help that he smelled like a distillery, and it wasn’t even noon yet,” Dean added.</p><p>Sam looked at his brother. He wanted to say something about pots calling kettles black, but he didn’t have the energy to get into an argument right then. He took another sip of coffee before speaking. “He didn’t seem that bad to me.”</p><p>The Winchesters had foregone their usual pose as FBI agents when visiting Lyle. They didn’t think the man would buy a couple Feds dropping by to check on a report of a two-headed, four-armed naked man eating garbage. Even with all their experience creating cover stories to explain their presence at crime scenes, they figured they’d have a tough time selling that one. Instead they’d told him they were staff reporters for <em>Ohio</em> magazine assigned to do a feature story on the state’s paranormal hotspots. Luckily, Lyle didn’t ask to see their nonexistent journalist IDs.</p><p>He hadn’t been able to tell them much more than they’d already gotten from the article in the <em>Broadsider,</em> and when he showed them the place where the multi-limbed monster had rooted through his trash, there were no discernible signs that anything out of the ordinary had been responsible. There were still remnants of garbage strewn across Lyle’s back yard: stained paper plates, empty liters of soda, crusty microwave meal trays, crumpled snack chip bags, and wadded-up fast-food wrappers. Lyle was a middle-aged man who proudly told them he was a lifelong bachelor, and from what Sam saw, the guy ate like one. When they asked him why he hadn’t cleaned up the mess yet, he said, “I ain’t touchin’ that crap! You think I wanna get monster cooties?”</p><p>Sam and Dean had exchanged looks at the cootie remark. It explained a great deal about why Lyle was a bachelor.</p><p>“Sam, his trash got hit by some kind of animal. A raccoon or a possum, maybe even a coyote. Not freaky Siamese twins.”</p><p>“Conjoined,” Sam said. “The proper term is <em>conjoined</em> twins.”</p><p>“Whatever. The point is that there’s nothing supernatural going on at Lyle’s place. He doesn’t need us; he needs a good shrink.”</p><p>“What about the peanut butter jar?”</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“The lid was off.”</p><p>“Yeah, I noticed. Are you saying that’s proof something with hands—like four of them—raided Lyle’s outdoor buffet? He may have thrown it away like that, with the lid and jar separate, and even if the lid was still on, raccoons have got hands, right? They could’ve gotten it off.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Sam said.</p><p>The EMF detector hadn’t picked up any energy emissions, and they hadn’t found any footprints, human or animal. They’d pretended to take notes, and they promised Lyle they’d send him a copy of the magazine when their article appeared. They left after that, and although Sam couldn’t disagree with his brother’s assessment of Lyle, he also couldn’t escape the feeling that the man was telling the truth. Call it hunter’s intuition. Maybe with a little work, he could convince Dean to reconsider Lyle’s story, but he’d worry about that later. Right now, they had a monster dog to catch.</p><p>They parked in front of the building closest to the pond, and walked down the hill toward the water. Both were armed—Dean’s shotgun loaded with regular shells instead of rock salt this time—and Sam carried a plastic shopping bag emblazoned with the logo of a large department store chain.</p><p>“I don’t know about this plan of yours, Sammy. It seems a little out there, even for you.”</p><p>Sam tried not to bristle at the implication—which admittedly he might be reading into his brother’s words—that his fragile mental state was responsible for him coming up with his unorthodox plan to lure the monster dog. “We know Frankenmutt drains life force, right? And after our encounter with him yesterday, he took a lot of damage. He’s going to need to heal, and that means he’ll have to feed.”</p><p>“Assuming he <em>can</em> heal,” Dean pointed out. “He might be like a movie zombie and just keep on rotting and getting nastier no matter how much he feeds.”</p><p>“Possibly,” Sam said. “But he didn’t show any sign of decay yesterday, right?”</p><p>“I guess not. He was one butt-ugly pooch, but his meat looked fresh enough.”</p><p>The brothers reached the pond, turned right, and headed into the woods.</p><p>Sam lowered his voice. “So if he needs to heal, he’ll be hungry, but he won’t be looking for food to eat, he’ll be looking for life force to absorb. That’s what we’re going to give him—or at least pretend to.”</p><p>“I get the logic,” Dean said, “I just don’t think that Frankenmutt’s going to fall for it. He may be some kind of freak, but he’s still a dog, and their senses are too sharp to...” He trailed off and pointed.</p><p>Sam looked where his brother indicated and saw the body of a rabbit lying on the ground, partially hidden by underbrush. At least, he thought it was a rabbit. The body had shrunken in upon itself, making the animal look like a skeleton covered with a layer of ill-fitting fur.</p><p>“Looks like Frankenmutt had a snack,” Dean said softly.</p><p>Sam nodded, and they continued deeper into the woods.</p><p>They encountered the desiccated corpses of other animals—more rabbits, a couple groundhogs, and a cat. The latter had no collar, and Sam figured it for a stray.</p><p>When they came upon a small clearing, Sam said, “This should do.”</p><p>Dean nodded and kept watch, shotgun at the ready, while Sam went to work. He knelt down and placed the shopping bag on the ground next to him. First he removed the lifelike baby doll they’d purchased from the store’s toy department. He’d already removed it from the packaging in the car, and he placed the pink, rubbery thing upon a small pile of leaves.</p><p>“Man, look at us, playing with dolls,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Sam ignored him.</p><p>Next, Sam took a container of baby powder—Softness for the Skin You Love was this brand’s slogan—and he sprinkled a good amount on the doll. He put the powder back in the bag and then withdrew a can of ready-made formula. He opened it and poured a little of the thick white liquid on the doll’s mouth. Not too much, just enough to simulate a baby who’s fed and needs its mouth wiped. He then set up the most important part of the illusion. He took his smart phone out of his jacket pocket, cranked the volume up as high as it would go, and activated the audio file he’d downloaded earlier. The sound of a baby crying echoed through the woods, and Sam placed the phone on the ground close to the doll’s head. Then he and Dean retreated to a pair of nearby trees and took cover. Sam set the plastic bag and the open can of formula on the ground, drew his Beretta, and together he and his brother waited.</p><p>The reasoning behind Sam’s plan was simple. Frankenmutt needed life force, and what had more life energy—at least in mystic terms—than a baby? Spiritually speaking, a baby was full of <em>potential</em> life energy. It was like a bank account full of money that no one had started to withdraw from yet. That made it a rich source of food for a creature like Frankenmutt. At least, that’s what Sam hoped.</p><p>When he’d been without a soul, Sam might’ve used a real baby as a lure. Oh, he’d have done everything he could to make sure the baby wasn’t harmed, but if something went wrong and the child died, soulless Sam wouldn’t—couldn’t have shed a tear. The thought made him sick, and he was glad those days were behind him. When Sam had first told Dean about his idea, Dean had admitted it had potential—even if it was a little on the demented side—but he’d voiced some doubts. <em>You can make it sound like a real baby, but it’ll still smell like plastic and rubber. Once Frankenmutt gets close enough to get a good whiff of Sammy Junior, he’ll know something’s wrong and turn tail.</em></p><p>Sam agreed that was a possibility, which was the reason for the baby powder and the formula: to make the doll seem more like a real baby. Sam had no idea if Frankenmutt had ever had a real life as a dog—or separate dogs—before becoming a freakish conglomerate monstrosity, but if he had, Sam hoped that somewhere in his doggy brain resided the memory of what babies smelled like. If not, then he hoped the creature would be so damned hungry that the cries of distress would be enough to lure it, and it wouldn’t be put off by the scent of plastic.</p><p>He’d set his phone to play the audio file on a loop, and several minutes passed while they listened to the baby’s cries without any sign of Frankenmutt.</p><p>“Maybe he filled up on animals and he’s not hungry anymore,” Dean said. “Or maybe he’s too far away to hear.”</p><p>Sam figured either was a possibility. “Let’s give it a bit longer before—“ He broke off. He’d caught sight of something out of the corner of his eye, and he spun toward it, Beretta raised and ready to fire.</p><p>He expected to see Frankenmutt bearing down on them, but instead he saw a man standing a dozen yards away, next to an old oak. Sam couldn’t make out his features clearly; almost as if he was viewing him through a sheet of gauze. He was of medium height and dressed in a dark suit. Blue? Black? Sam couldn’t tell. His hair color was light, most likely blond, but maybe white. His age was impossible to guess, as his facial features were a flesh-colored shimmer that rippled continuously like water.</p><p>“What?” Dean said, turning and bringing his shotgun around.</p><p>Before Sam could reply, the figure vanished. One instant he was there, the next—poof!—like he’d never existed. A wave of dizziness came over Sam, accompanied by a deep weariness that he could feel down to the bottoms of his feet. The Beretta felt suddenly heavy in his hand, and he thought it might slip from his fingers and fall to the ground. But he managed to maintain his grip on the weapon, and a second later the dizziness passed and the weariness eased, although the latter didn’t leave him entirely.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” Sam said. “Thought I saw something. I was wrong.”</p><p>Dean scowled at him, and Sam could guess what he was thinking.</p><p>“I’m fine,” he insisted. “All my marbles are more or less in place.”</p><p>Dean grunted. “It’s the <em>less</em> I’m worried about.”</p><p>Sam said nothing. So he’d had a hallucination, so what? It wasn’t his first, and he doubted it would be his last. The important thing was that it hadn’t lasted very long, and it hadn’t distracted him from—</p><p>A branch snapped behind them. Followed by a low, throaty growl.</p><p>“It’s behind us, isn’t it?” Sam said.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>The brothers whirled around and fired.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lyle Swanson was not a happy man.</p><p>Not that this was out of character for him. Even at the best of times, he wasn’t the cheeriest of people. His fellow employees at Swifty Print had what they thought was an ironic, and hilarious, nickname for him: Mr. Sunshine. It wasn’t that he was foul-tempered. He didn’t get angry or frustrated when things went wrong, and he didn’t complain about setbacks. He wasn’t a particularly chatty man, but he didn’t avoid conversations with his coworkers, either. He was just one of those people who seem perpetually gloomy. If he’d been a cartoon character, he would’ve had a small black raincloud hovering over his head all the time. He shuffled when he walked, shoulders slumped, head tilted at a downward angle, facial features slack and drooping. He rarely smiled, and when he did, it was with the barest upturn of the mouth, the expression so muted that most people didn’t recognize it for what it was. And no one could ever remember hearing him laugh, not even so much as a soft chuckle.</p><p>There was no reason for Lyle to be a human incarnation of Eeyore, at least none that he could see. He’d had a happy enough childhood, and while he hadn’t been popular in school, no one had bullied him. In fact, most of the kids had barely noticed he existed, and the same went for the teachers. His life so far, while wholly unremarkable, had been almost entirely without conflict of any significance. Yes, he was a bit of a germaphobe, the kind of person who’s never without hand sanitizer and wipes. And he’d never had much interest in sex. It seemed like too much work and, to be frank, more than a little messy.</p><p>His job—you really couldn’t call it a career—wasn’t the most fulfilling in the world, but it paid his bills, and the benefits, while not outstanding, were sufficient for his needs. He had his own house, a small one just outside the town limits, where it was nice and quiet. When naked monsters weren’t digging in his trash can, that was.</p><p>His health was good, and according to his doctor, if he kept going as he was, there was an excellent chance he’d live to a ripe old age. There was absolutely no reason on Earth why Lyle should be, as his mother used to put it, a Gloomy Gus. He supposed he’d simply been born that way.</p><p>Today, however, he had more than ample reason to be unhappy. It was bad enough that a trash-hungry bare-assed monster had paid him a visit the day before, but what really stuck in Lyle’s craw was how everyone had reacted to his story. The police had come out to take his statement, sure, but had they done any real investigating? Had they taken photographs, dusted for fingerprints, taken plaster molds of footprints, or swabbed for DNA? Had they done anything that the crime scene investigators on TV did? Hell, no. They hadn’t even bothered to search the woods behind his property. He’d had the feeling that it had taken every ounce of control the officers possessed to keep from laughing the entire time they were talking with him.</p><p>As bad as that had been, the story in the <em>Broadsider</em> that morning had been worse. Good thing he got the paper delivered or else he might not have seen the article before heading in to work. He’d called in sick because he hadn’t wanted to deal with his fellow employees making fun of him all day. Marcy, one of Swifty Print’s managers, had answered his call, and when he told her he wasn’t coming in, she asked if he was playing hooky so he could spend the day with his new friend. Before he could respond, she’d added. <em>Just be careful. You never know what a naked man will get up to. The stories I could tell you, honey! Just remember one thing...</em> And here she’d paused for effect. <em>Forewarned is four-armed!</em></p><p>He hung up on her peal of laughter.</p><p>Then those two magazine writers had come by. They’d seemed professional enough at first. They acted as if they were genuinely interested in hearing his story, and they listened closely as he went over the details. But when he showed them the mess in the back yard, they’d begun to seem doubtful. They hadn’t said as much, but he’d caught the looks they tossed back and forth. Looks that said, <em>We got ourselves a real piece of work here.</em> Like the police, they didn’t take any photos, and that was when he knew they weren’t going to include him in their article. Magazines <em>always</em> used pictures with the stories they ran. The fact that they hadn’t bothered to take any told him everything he needed to know about what they thought of his... well, he supposed you’d call it a sighting.</p><p><em>Maybe I shouldn’t have used the word cooties,</em> he thought.</p><p>So now here he was, working in his back yard to clean up the mess left by the whatever-the-hell-it-was. He wore rubber gloves and a surgical mask to protect himself from the worst of the germs. He wished he had a pair of coveralls, too, but he didn’t. Instead, he’d donned an old long-sleeved plaid shirt and a pair of jeans, both of which he’d bag up and throw away when he finished with the clean up. Even with the gloves, he didn’t want to touch the trash. Maybe monsters didn’t have cooties as such, but something had caused those weird deaths where people shriveled up like prunes, and he wasn’t about to take any chances. He didn’t own a tool designed for picking up litter, so he’d had to improvise. He’d taken a pair of salad tongs from his kitchen, and they did the job well enough. Of course, they’d have to be thrown away too when he was finished, but that was okay. Utensils were easily replaced. A man’s life, not so much.</p><p>Lyle was bent over and in the process of picking up a torn and empty package that had once contained fudge-covered vanilla-cream sandwich cookies—his only real vice—when he felt a tingling sensation on the back of his neck. He froze there, crouching, salad tongs gripping the cookie package in one gloved hand, a plastic garbage bag for the trash he’d gathered so far in the other. Someone—<em>something</em>—was watching him.</p><p>He didn’t consider himself an especially brave man, but he didn’t think of himself as a coward, either. He didn’t like scary books or movies, but not because they frightened him. He didn’t think they were realistic. Sure, bad things happened to people—sometimes <em>really</em> bad things, but awful as they were, they were understandable, even routine in some ways. Diseases, accidents, natural disasters, and most common of all, humans being shitty to one another. But to be scared of some horrible unknown thing lurking in the shadows? It had seemed ridiculous.</p><p>Now—frozen in mid-crouch in his back yard, the surgical mask covering the lower half of his face suddenly tight and stifling—he knew how the people in those stories felt. They weren’t simply frightened, they were <em>terrified,</em> breath caught in their throats, hearts pounding a trip-hammer beat, sweat erupting from their pores, stomachs filled with ice water. They felt small and weak, caught between two all-consuming but opposing impulses: to run away as fast and far as they possibly could, and also to stand statue-still and hope to remain unnoticed by the nameless thing that stalked them. Lyle now knew what they knew—what it was like to be prey. He’d never been so scared in his life.</p><p>He heard breathing first, heavy and labored, punctuated with a soft whistling-wheezing sound, as if the lungs producing it weren’t quite working right. The sound was off to his left, and he didn’t want to turn his head to look, he really didn’t. He’d rather squeeze his eyes shut and, like a child hiding under the covers in the dark, hope that if he couldn’t see the monster, it couldn’t see him. But he turned his head anyway, he couldn’t keep himself from doing so, and when he did, he saw exactly what he expected to.</p><p>The monster had returned.</p><p>Yesterday he’d watched the creature from within the safety of his home, peeking through the small white curtain that covered the back-door window. He’d been concealed from the thing’s view, protected by a solid wooden door locked with a deadbolt. It had been a strange sight, that was for damn sure, but he hadn’t felt threatened. The situation had been so bizarre that it hadn’t seemed real. He’d felt like a detached observer, watching the creature on a TV screen. It had seemed absurd with its two heads and four arms, like something out of a child’s cartoon. But now, with the creature standing less than a dozen yards away and nothing between them but air, it didn’t seem so absurd. In fact, it was downright terrifying.</p><p>It stood six feet tall, and its naked body—aside from the extra parts—was that of a normal man. Although it carried a few extra pounds around the middle, it was in relatively good shape, with hard muscle and a light covering of black body hair. Each head had to lean to the side—one right, one left—in order for them to fit on a single body, and Lyle found himself thinking that both of the poor sons of bitches probably suffered from perpetually sore necks. The head on the right had straight black hair that hung in long greasy clumps, and an unkempt beard that was badly in need of trimming. The head on the left had a lighter complexion, and its thick hair was a soft ginger color. It was clean-shaven, with a dusting of freckles on the cheeks. Both heads held similar expressions: eyes wide and wild, mouths slack and open. A thin line of drool ran from the corner of Ginger’s mouth and dribbled onto its chest.</p><p>It stood hunched forward, no doubt because of the added weight of those extra arms and head. The second set of arms protruded from the front of the creature’s shoulders, and were thinner than the other pair, the skin lighter, body hair almost nonexistent.</p><p><em>They’re Ginger’s arms,</em> Lyle thought, and his stomach gave a flip at this realization.</p><p>Right then, all four of its arms were hanging loosely, as if it had forgotten for the moment that they were there.</p><p>Lyle noticed another detail, one he’d missed before. At the junctures where Ginger’s body parts connected with Black Hair’s were patches of skin that didn’t look right. The color and texture were strange, artificial somehow, and it reminded Lyle of the Silly Putty he’d played with as a child. Of all the wrong things there were about this creature, that not-skin was somehow the worst, and looking at it made Lyle feel sick to his stomach. Well, sicker.</p><p>For a long moment the monster stared at him with its two pairs of eyes, as if it was as surprised to see Lyle as Lyle was to see it. <em>Maybe he’s wondering what happened to</em> my <em>extra head and arms,</em> Lyle thought. The idea struck him as so ridiculous that he couldn’t help letting out a short laugh, although it sounded more like a sob. The creature started at the sound, and for an instant Lyle thought it might bolt like a frightened deer and run back to the woods. But instead its two mouths stretched into hideous lopsided grins.</p><p>“Hun!” Black-Hair said.</p><p>“Gee!” Ginger said.</p><p>There was a short pause between the sounds, but when the heads spoke a second time they did so in rapid succession, so the syllables came out as a single almost-word.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Ice collected on Lyle’s spine, and his bowels turned watery. The creature spoke in the simplistic manner of a toddler, but this time Lyle had no trouble understanding what it—they—were saying.</p><p><em>Hungry.</em></p><p>Lyle dropped the garbage bag and tongs, and ran like hell for his house. The creature let out two excited hoots, like those a large ape might make, and gave pursuit.</p><p>Lyle heard its pounding footfalls and whistle-wheeze breath, and adrenaline surged through his system, spurring him to run faster. He once again felt a tingle on the back of his neck, only now the sensation seemed to be warning him that the two-headed monstrosity was reaching for him, its fingers—nails overlong, cracked, and split—mere inches from his flesh. The feeling was so strong that he couldn’t stop himself from looking back over his shoulder, and as soon as he did, he wished he’d resisted the impulse. The creature wasn’t as close as he’d feared, about fifteen feet behind him—which was good—but the <em>way</em> it ran... It moved with a spastic, lopsided gait, as if its nervous system had short-circuited and was firing off impulses at random. Instead of reaching out to grab him as he’d pictured, all four of the creature’s arms hung limply, the extremities flailing and flopping as their owner continued to lurch after Lyle. It was without doubt the most horrible thing Lyle had ever seen. So why did it strike him as almost funny?</p><p>A giggle escaped his mouth, one tinged with more than a hint of hysteria.</p><p>As if the giggle was a cue, the creature bellowed its tag-team word again.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Lyle’s giggle became a shriek, and he faced forward and ran even faster.</p><p>He’d left the back door unlocked, and even though his hands were sweating something fierce, the rubber gloves kept his grip from being slick, so he was able to turn the knob without difficulty. People at work teased him about being OCD, but he wished they could see him right then.</p><p><em>Who’s crazy now?</em></p><p>He threw open the door, lunged inside, and slammed it shut behind him, whirled around, threw the deadbolt, engaged the smaller lock on the knob, and backed quickly away. He moved too fast, stumbled over his own feet, and fell backward, landing hard on his ass. The impact jolted his spine and caused his teeth to clack together painfully. In the process he bit into the tip of his tongue, and blood started to fill his mouth. He tried to spit, remembered the surgical mask, tore it off his face and dropped it on the kitchen floor. He then turned his head and expelled a glob of blood. It splattered onto a lower cabinet door, but he didn’t notice, and even if he had, he wouldn’t have cared. He had more important things to worry about right now than a little mess. OCD be damned.</p><p>He fixed his gaze on the door and waited.</p><p><em>It won’t get in,</em> Lyle told himself. <em>The lock’s strong. I know, because I installed it myself.</em> Besides, the way those arms were flapping around, they might not function properly. If that was so, even if the door had been unlocked, the creature might not be able to turn the knob. So no matter what, he was safe. He <em>was.</em></p><p>The door burst inward without any warning, glass shattering, hinges tearing free, the deadbolt ripping through the jamb. The door slid across the floor and bumped to a stop against Lyle’s feet.</p><p>The two-headed man stood in the now-open doorway, all four arms held out ramrod straight, palms up.</p><p><em>Guess those arms work after all,</em> he thought.</p><p>The creature lurched into the kitchen, double grins widening into twin leers.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Lyle heard someone laughing, and it took him a moment to realize that the sound bubbled up from his own throat. The whole thing was just too damned messed-up to take seriously.</p><p>The creature reached Lyle, knelt awkwardly before him, and placed all fours hand on the sides of the man’s face. Lyle’s laughter broke off in a gasp. The monster’s flesh was cold—so cold it burned.</p><p>Then a great heaviness settled on Lyle, and with it came a weariness more powerful than any he’d ever known. He struggled to keep his eyes open, but really, what was the point? His limbs felt as if they’d turned to lead, and although he tried to pull away from the monster’s quadruple grip, he was weak as a newborn. He couldn’t move, let alone fight. It would be simpler to just give in, let his eyes close, and allow himself to slip away.</p><p>So that’s what he did.</p><p>Just before the endless darkness took hold of Lyle and swept him away forever, he heard a pair of voices speak a single word.</p><p>“Good...”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Is it dead?” Dean asked.</p><p>“How should I know?” Sam said.</p><p>“Check it.”</p><p><em>“You</em> check it!”</p><p>Dean had pumped every round his shotgun held into that damned dog, and Sam had emptied his Beretta’s clip, reloaded, and continued firing. Frankenmutt was down, finally, but neither of the brothers was sure it was permanent. During his years as a hunter Dean had encountered a lot of supernatural entities that were hard to kill, but he’d rarely run into anything as tough as this patchwork pooch. Frankenmutt lay on its side, its flesh a savaged, bloody ruin from all the damage it had taken. Dean almost felt sorry for the thing. Almost.</p><p>“Give me a sec.”</p><p>Dean reloaded his weapon, then stepped forward slowly, lowering the barrel until it was pressed against Frankenmutt’s head. He nodded to Sam, who walked over to the monstrous dog and prodded its belly with his foot. When the creature didn’t react, he prodded it harder. Still no response.</p><p>“Doesn’t look like it’s breathing,” Sam said.</p><p>“Since when does that matter in our line of work?”</p><p>“True.” Sam leveled his Beretta and put another round in the beast’s side. Its body bucked with the impact, but otherwise it didn’t move.</p><p>“I’m voting for dead,” Dean said.</p><p>“I’m good with that.”</p><p>Dean removed the shotgun from the creature’s head and waited while Sam retrieved the doll and his phone. Sam tucked the doll under his arm and turned off the crying baby sound effect on his phone, tucked the device into a pocket, and returned. The two of them then crouched down to examine the patchwork dog’s corpse. As ugly as the thing was, Dean expected it to smell like something that you’d find at the bottom of a slaughterhouse Dumpster, but it just smelled like a normal dog. He sniffed. Make that a normal dog covered in blood.</p><p>“The sections all look like parts of regular dogs,” Sam said. “Except for the face. That’s pretty messed up.” He trailed a finger along the line of hairless tissue between the dog’s right front leg and its shoulder. Similar lines crisscrossed the beast’s body.</p><p>“Doesn’t look much like scar tissue, does it?” Dean said.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Doesn’t feel like it, either. It’s kind of... spongy.”</p><p>A line of the strange flesh circled Frankenmutt’s neck, and Dean reached out and touched it. It was firmer than normal skin, and when he pressed it in, it remained that way for a moment before slowly returning to its previous shape. <em>Weird.</em></p><p>“I see what you mean. It’s almost like some kind of... I don’t know, glue or something.”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing.”</p><p>Dean straightened, and the brothers regarded the body of the monster dog in silence for a time.</p><p>After a while, Sam asked, “Which end do you want?”</p><p>Dean considered for a moment. “Man, there’s no good choice here, is there?” He took another look at the creature’s distorted face and sighed. “I never thought I’d be saying this about an animal, but I’ll take the ass. Try not to get too much blood on you.”</p><p>They each took an end, lifted, and began carrying Frankenmutt out of the woods. Halfway back to the car, Sam stopped and turned his head sharply to the left.</p><p>Dean tensed, senses on high alert, ready for another attack. He looked in the same direction as Sam, but couldn’t see anything but trees and underbrush.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked.</p><p>Sam didn’t answer right away. He squinted, as if he were having a hard time focusing his eyes on whatever he was looking at. Finally, he shook his head as if attempting to clear it.</p><p>“For a minute, I thought... Never mind. It’s nothing. Let’s go. Frankenmutt’s not getting any lighter.”</p><p>The brothers continued lugging the dead dog, Dean unable to decide what bothered him more: that Sam’s arms were trembling with the effort of carrying his half of the creature—Frankenmutt was a big boy, but he wasn’t <em>that</em> heavy, not with the two of them sharing the load—or that it looked like his hallucinations were getting worse.</p><p><em>Just once, it would be nice if a hunt went down easy,</em> he thought. <em>We stroll into town, find the Nasty Whatzit, walk up to it, gank it, and stroll on out. No muss, no fuss.</em></p><p><em>Yeah, right. And maybe vampires would quit sucking blood and start chugging energy drinks instead.</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>He saw me.</p><p>Daniel wasn’t sure how that was possible. The living couldn’t see his kind, not even if he wanted them to. But the younger brother had stared right at him. Daniel had felt the youth’s gaze bore into him. For the first time in all his long existence as a Reaper, he’d felt exposed, and he’d slipped behind an ash tree to conceal himself. He’d felt absurd, hiding like that, as if he were... well, mortal.</p><p>But once the shaggy-haired youth went back to helping his brother cart the corpse of the dead dog-thing away, Daniel caught the whiff of death coming off him, and realized what must have happened. He waited until they were out of sight, and then followed after them, careful not to make too much noise. Again, he felt ridiculous taking such precautions, but he had no idea how sharp the youth’s death-perception had become, and he wasn’t going to take any chances.</p><p>He found what he was looking for almost right away. The dog-thing’s bullet-ravaged corpse had left a trail of blood drops in the brothers’ wake, but he wasn’t interested in those. It was the other trail that caught his attention. A thin wavering black line hovered an inch above the ground, thready and faint, like ink released in water. Daniel knelt to get a closer look at it. It was fading quickly, and he touched his index finger to a section of the shadow-line before it dissipated. He brought his fingertip, now smeared with a soot-like smudge, up to his nose. He sniffed a couple times before inserting his finger into his mouth. When he withdrew his finger a moment later, the tip was clean.</p><p>He was now certain what had happened to the younger brother, and it wasn’t good. At least, not for the boy. But as for Daniel... he might be able to make this work in his favor.</p><p>He stood and continued following the brothers, amending his plans to take this unforeseen, but not entirely unwelcome, development into account.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Peter Martinez sat in front of his office computer monitor staring at rows of data displayed on the screen. He wasn’t reviewing the information, at least not in the usual way. He’d purposely unfocused his gaze to the point where the numbers were blurry, and then he tried to relax and allow his mind to wander. He knew this data forward and backward, and he’d tried analyzing it using every logical method he could think of, without success. So today he’d decided to try a more creative approach. Instead of tackling the problem in a linear fashion, he was going to try turning his subconscious loose on it. As much as scientific advances were a result of step-by-step processes, they also were born in sudden unexpected bursts of insight, the fabled and often sought after Eureka! moment. Today Peter hoped to cultivate a moment of his own.</p><p>His office wasn’t very large, nor was it impressive. If it hadn’t been for the nameplate affixed to the wall outside, no one would have guessed that this was the office of the CEO and Head of Development for NuFlesh Biotech. Though considering that his office was located in a strip mall between a sub shop and a license bureau, and that the business had a total of five employees, including himself, he didn’t see much point in putting on airs. He wore a long-sleeved red pullover and jeans, a step below corporate casual, which was fine as far as he was concerned. He was a scientist, not a stockbroker. He wore a full black beard, partially because he thought it made him look more intelligent—and a bit roguish—but mostly to hide the burn scars that covered the lower right half of his face. He did all his “paperwork” virtually, and aside from the computer, the top of his desk was empty. He had a few books on the shelf behind him, none of which he’d touched in who knew how long. His doctoral diploma hung on one wall, while on the opposite was a framed poster—a large black-and-white photo of Einstein sticking his tongue out. The poster was supposed to remind Peter not to take everything so seriously, but today the sight of it only pissed him off. He couldn’t afford to let the stress get to him. Not if he wanted to create the optimal conditions for a subconscious breakthrough. And he badly needed one.</p><p>Two years, seven months, eight days. That was how long he’d been struggling to solve this particular problem, and at this point, he was willing to try almost anything. The financial state of his company wasn’t exactly “robust,” as the corporate types would put it, and if he didn’t make some progress on the new formula soon... He thrust the thought from his mind. Worrying about money was no way to relax. He gazed at the screen and allowed his breathing to become slow and even, and before long he felt his body relax against his office chair. That’s when it kicked in.</p><p>The Itch.</p><p>It began on his right shoulder blade, little more than the sensation of a feather brushing against his skin. He could ignore that. But it soon spread across his entire back, his chest, down his right arm, up his neck and across the right side of his face, building in intensity until it felt as if a thousand ants were crawling over his skin. That he <em>couldn’t</em> ignore.</p><p>“Don’t scratch,” he whispered. He gripped the armrests of his chair tight, fingers digging into the padding. He knew from long, painful experience that not only didn’t scratching make the itch go away, once he got started, he wouldn’t be able to stop until he’d clawed bloody runnels in his flesh. Even then the itching would continue.</p><p>Peter knew it was common for burn victims to experience discomfort like his, even long after their burns had healed and scar tissue formed. In his case, that had been almost three decades before. He’d gotten his scars as a result of a house fire caused by his idiot of a stepfather falling asleep on the couch one night while smoking. Peter and his mother got out of the house in time, but his stepfather hadn’t made it. His mother hadn’t lasted long, either. She’d died en route to the hospital, not from her burns—severe as they were—but from a heart attack. Peter had only been eleven at the time. Even though twenty-seven years and more operations than he cared to think about had passed since then, the Itch, when it came, was as bad as ever.</p><p>The many doctors and specialists he’d seen over the years had prescribed a variety of remedies for the Itch: topical lotions to stretch and loosen the scar tissue, hypoallergenic lotions, anti-itch creams like hydrocortisone, and analgesic creams such as lidocaine. None of them worked except lidocaine, and even that only managed to take the edge off the Itch. There was only one treatment he’d ever found that provided relief, and he’d used up the last of it a couple days before. He’d tried contacting his supplier, but so far the man hadn’t responded to any of his voicemails or texts. If he didn’t get in touch soon, Peter didn’t know what he was going to—</p><p>His desk phone rang, and the sound made him jump. He snatched the receiver off the hook and answered the call, speaking through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Damn it, Allison! I <em>told</em> you I didn’t want—“</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Martinez. I know you asked me not to disturb you, but Mr. Dippel is here, and I thought—“</p><p>“Send him in.” He hung up without saying goodbye.</p><p>He didn’t like being brusque with his office assistant, but he couldn’t help it. When the Itch was upon him like this, it took everything he had not to scream. He remembered one of his doctors telling him that while he was certain the itching was real, it couldn’t possibly be as intense as Peter reported.</p><p><em>I’m confident there’s a somatic component at work here,</em> the doctor had said.</p><p>Peter wasn’t an MD, but he was a biochemist, and he’d known damn well what the doctor had <em>really</em> meant. <em>Psychosomatic.</em> Unlike most people, Peter knew that psychosomatic sensations were real, but they were caused by mental processes rather than disease or injury. The simplest example was the stomach pain some people experienced before a stressful event, such as an important exam or presentation at work. The pain was real, the physical processes that caused it were real, but it was triggered by stress. Peter’s understanding of what the doctor had said didn’t mean he agreed with it, though.</p><p><em>There’s a strong correlation between people who experience somatic pain and those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The fire you survived...</em></p><p>Peter shoved the memory away.</p><p>With every fiber of his being, all the way down to the subatomic level, he was certain that the Itch was solely the result of the terrible injuries he’d suffered as a child, and not related to his emotional state in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>Normally he would have gone into the outer office to greet Dippel, but he feared that if he took his hands off the chair’s armrests, he’d start digging his fingernails into his skin and wouldn’t be able to stop. So he sat and gripped his chair even tighter and waited. A moment later there was a soft knock at the door. Peter tried to say, <em>Come in,</em> but the words came out as a pained grunting. They were enough to get the message across, though. The door opened and Conrad entered.</p><p>“Hello, Peter. As always, it’s good to see you. Please, don’t get up. I can see that you’re... concentrating.” Conrad gave him a thin smile as he took a seat in the chair in front of Peter’s desk.</p><p>Peter was struck anew by the strength of Conrad’s presence. Whenever the man was in the room, everything seemed to gravitate toward him. People’s attention, for one thing. It was hard as hell to take your eyes off him. It took an effort even to blink. But it was more than that. The air flowed toward him, leaving the rest of the room hot and stuffy, and he drew in light as well, illuminating himself more brightly while deepening the shadows everywhere else. It was as if he exerted his own manner of gravitational pull, one that was somehow more psychic in nature than physical. It was a ridiculous idea, Peter knew—he was a scientist, for God’s sake!—but it was one he couldn’t shake.</p><p>As always, Conrad wore a suit and tie, making him look more like a business owner than Peter. If it was possible, the man appeared even more cadaverous than the last time Peter had seen him, and not for the first time he wondered if Conrad was battling some sort of disease, cancer maybe. But despite his appearance, the man always seemed to be alert and filled with energy. After nearly thirty years of having people look at his own burn scars first before noticing there was a human being attached to them—if indeed they ever noticed—Peter certainly knew better than to judge by appearances. One thing he liked about Conrad, in fact, was that the man never seemed bothered by his scars. It wasn’t that he was able to put aside his disgust, which was what most people who considered themselves enlightened did. Conrad was well aware of Peter’s scars, but he wasn’t repulsed by them. He always met Peter’s gaze, and never averted his eyes. Peter even occasionally had the uneasy feeling that Conrad <em>liked</em> looking at his scars.</p><p>“I’m sorry that I haven’t returned your messages,” Conrad continued. “I’ve been especially busy of late. I had hoped to find you in good health, but regrettably, I see that isn’t the case. I take it that your supply of my special unguent has been expended?”</p><p><em>You know damn well it has, you bastard! I left you enough messages saying so!</em></p><p>Out loud, Peter simply said, “Yes.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Then it is indeed fortuitous that I stopped in for a visit today.”</p><p>He reached into the inner breast pocket of his jacket and removed a glass vial with an old-fashioned cork stopper. The contents was a pale green-tinged yellow, an unappealing color, but Peter didn’t care what it looked like. He only cared that it worked.</p><p>Conrad placed the vial on the desk top, but when Peter tried to grab it, he snatched it away.</p><p>“My usual fee?” he asked.</p><p><em>Yes, yes, YES!</em> Peter nodded.</p><p>Satisfied, Conrad handed over the vial. Peter snatched it from him, pulled the cork out with his teeth, and spat it onto the desk. Then, without a scrap of self-consciousness, he stood, pulled off his shirt, and threw it to the floor. Reddish scar tissue covered the right side of his body from the lower half of his face, down to his mid-abdomen, including three-quarters of his right arm, as well as his right shoulder and shoulder blade. The air should have felt good on his exposed skin, but all it did was intensify the Itch, which had already reached maddening levels. Peter dumped some of the thick oily unguent into his palm and began smearing it on, moving as fast as he could.</p><p>“Not too much,” Conrad cautioned. “A little goes a long way.”</p><p>Peter ignored him and kept slathering it onto his body. Relief was almost instantaneous. A cool tingling sensation began to spread across his scarred flesh, the Itch receding in its wake. He let out a sigh and collapsed back into his chair, not caring if he smeared any of the goop on the fabric. He must look a sight, shirtless, scar tissue glistening with a sheen of oily yellow-green gunk, but he didn’t care. All that mattered was the Itch was gone.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said.</p><p>Conrad acknowledged Peter’s gratitude with a slow nod.</p><p>“I know I’ve said it before, but I wish you’d give me the formula for this stuff. I’d pay any price for it.”</p><p>“I do not wish to be insulting, but given the current state of your business, such an offer can only be hyperbole.”</p><p>Peter <em>was</em> insulted, but he knew he couldn’t argue the point. He’d developed NuFlesh—the product, not the business he’d named for it—for people like him. NuFlesh was artificial skin that paramedics could use as a temporary wound patch until they could get an accident victim to the hospital. In that regard, it was successful. It did indeed seal off wounds and burns, keeping them protected and free of infection. Unfortunately, it tended to decay after an hour, two at the most, and tests had suggested it might be toxic, making long-term use impossible. So even if Peter managed to solve the decay problem—which was his current focus—he would then have to turn his attention to the toxicity issue. All of this added up to a sad bottom line for NuFlesh Biotech, and he and his employees were far from rolling in money. It was the major reason he’d located his business in Brennan. Office space was cheap. If he could make his artificial skin work, he’d change the world of medicine forever—and get stinking rich into the bargain. But that, as the saying goes, was a mighty big <em>if.</em></p><p>“Besides, even if I gave you the formula, I doubt you’d be able to replicate it successfully,” Conrad said, then smiled. “After all, it isn’t as if you haven’t already made the attempt, hmm?”</p><p>Peter could feel himself flush with embarrassment. It was true. He’d attempted to analyze the chemical unguent on several occasions, and while he’d been able to determine the ingredients and their proportions easily enough, he couldn’t make the damned stuff work, no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>“You’ve told me the unguent is an ancient formula once used by the Egyptians to protect their skin from dry heat.”</p><p>“My own variation on that formula, but essentially, yes,” Conrad confirmed.</p><p>Peter forced a smile. “Let me guess: the reason I can’t recreate it is that I lack the magic touch.”</p><p>Conrad’s smile widened. “Precisely.”</p><p>Peter scowled. He hated it when he had the feeling that Conrad was toying with him.</p><p>The man had approached him a few months before, saying that he’d read about NuFlesh on the company’s website and was intrigued by its promise. He’d wanted to purchase fifty pounds of the stuff for his own unspecified research needs. Peter’s patent on the most recent version of the NuFlesh formula was still pending, and he was reluctant at first to allow someone who might be a potential competitor to have that much of the material. Then, when Conrad had told him he had a treatment that would relieve Peter’s periodic itching—although how the man had known about that, Peter had no idea—he’d been skeptical. But Conrad had delivered, and Peter had been only too happy to let him have his pound of artificial flesh, times fifty, in exchange. Since then, Conrad, who’d always presented himself as something of an old-world gentleman, had become increasingly snide and even cruel at times, and Peter would have been happy to sever their relationship... if he hadn’t needed Conrad’s mysterious unguent so damned bad.</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t know what you’re doing with all the NuFlesh you’ve... I guess purchased isn’t the right word. Bartered, I suppose. You know it’s unstable and potentially toxic to boot.”</p><p>“It suits my current needs as is,” Conrad said. “And I can, as people say these days, work around those problems.”</p><p>Peter burned with curiosity. No matter how many times he tried to pry details out of Conrad about what he wanted NuFlesh for, the man never gave away anything. He wondered if Conrad had found a way to solve the decay and toxicity issues. He had no idea what the man’s educational and professional backgrounds were—again, Conrad had resisted his attempts to find out—but he gave the impression that he was well acquainted with the sciences, especially chemistry. The unguent was proof of that. Maybe if he offered Conrad a job? Not that he had any money to pay him. But if he made him a partner...</p><p>“I’d like a hundred pounds this time,” Conrad said. “If at all possible.”</p><p>Peter unconsciously rubbed the scar tissue beneath his beard as he thought. His fingers came away sticky with unguent. “That’s just about all I have on hand at the moment. It takes a while to manufacture, you know, and there are experiments scheduled...”</p><p>Conrad once again reached into his inner jacket pocket, removed a second stoppered vial, and placed it on the desk.</p><p>Peter looked upon it with an addict’s hungry gaze.</p><p>“You have a deal.”</p><p>As he reached for it, Conrad grabbed his hand and stopped him. It was the first time the man had touched him, and Peter was surprised by how cold his flesh was.</p><p>“A warning. My unguent comes with certain... side effects if used too frequently and in large amounts. It is why I have made sure to parcel it out rather than give you too much at one time. Take care not to use it more than once every two days. Three would be preferable. You must heed my instructions, regardless of how intense your itching may become. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Sure. Whatever you say.”</p><p>Conrad looked deep into his eyes, as if trying to gauge his sincerity, before finally releasing his hand. Peter grabbed the second vial and held it close to his face. The yellow-green contents resembled bottled mucus, but right now it was one of the most beautiful sights he’d ever seen.</p><p><em>Screw you, Itch,</em> he thought.</p><p>Although it might have been his imagination, he could’ve sworn he felt a slight momentary irritation behind his right ear, as if the Itch was saying, <em>Don’t worry. I’ll be back</em>—<em>soon. And then we’ll</em> really <em>have some fun!</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>A short time later, Conrad drove away from the strip mall, ninety pounds of NuFlesh on the back seat of his black SUV, sealed in airtight plastic and packed in unmarked cardboard boxes. It was less than he wanted, but it was all Peter had, so it would have to do. Peter promised to call him when he had more made, and considering how badly the man needed his unguent, Conrad had no doubt he’d make good on his promise.</p><p>NuFlesh was amazing material, and although Conrad had no idea if Peter would ever perfect it, it didn’t matter as far as his purpose was concerned. As he’d told the man, the current NuFlesh formula was sufficient for his needs—as long as he added a few alchemical touches of his own.</p><p>There was much that Conrad didn’t like about the modern world—for the most part the people were unrefined and ill-mannered, and they seemed incapable of concentrating on a single task for any length of time—but he found the Internet exceedingly useful. He’d been fortunate to discover the NuFlesh website one evening while doing research, and had been filled with excitement, hoping that at last he’d found the answer he’d been searching so long for. The material had worked better than he’d dared dream, and now, after three long centuries, he was finally on the verge of seeing his vision made reality.</p><p>“Praise Hel,” he whispered.</p><p>In addition to the NuFlesh, there were two metal coolers in the storage area behind the SUV’s back seat. In each of them, packed in ice and wrapped in strips of cloth soaked in an alchemical mixture of his own devising, were the other supplies Catherine needed. She’d given him a list, and he’d gone out last night and done his best to procure all the items on it. Unfortunately, the two homeless men that he’d chosen as donors hadn’t been in the best of health—he’d seen evidence of cancer in one man’s lungs in addition to an enlarged heart, and he’d found cirrhosis in the other’s liver along with a surprisingly large tumor in the brain. He’d been forced to leave the affected organs behind, for even with the skilled application of NuFlesh, they would be useless. But he’d managed to obtain most of the items Catherine desired, and he thought she would be pleased. If she needed anything more, he could always go out again that night. Not only was he highly practiced at procurement, no matter how many centuries he’d done it, the work never got old for him.</p><p><em>It’s the simple pleasures,</em> he thought, and smiled.</p><p>He felt a sudden vibration in his front pants pocket that startled him. He removed one hand from the steering wheel, reached into his pocket, and pulled out his cell phone. As always, he thought he’d never get used to the damnable contraptions. He looked at the screen display, saw Catherine’s name, and answered it.</p><p>“Hello, Catherine. It’s quite a coincidence that you called. Even as we speak, I am on my way to your home to deliver—“</p><p>She cut him off, something a well-bred woman would never have done in his day. “Have you seen today’s paper?” she demanded.</p><p>At first he thought the bodies of the two homeless men had been discovered, and she was upset. But he dismissed that possibility at once. In all the time they’d been “collaborating,” she had never directly addressed the issue of where he came by the raw material he brought her, even though he knew it made her uncomfortable. No, it had to be something else.</p><p>“Has the dog struck again? Do not concern yourself. After I have brought your supplies, I will go in search of the beast and—“</p><p>“It’s not the damned dog! It’s something else.”</p><p>She’d done it again! If he didn’t need the woman’s medical skills so badly... Her words sank in then.</p><p>“Something... else?”</p><p>She proceeded to tell him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What’s the name of this place we’re looking for again?” Dean asked.</p><p>“NuFlesh Biotech.”</p><p>They were driving through downtown Brennan, after a stop back at the motel to do a little research, scarf down some fast-food takeout, and change into their suits. Dean had eaten a half-pound bacon cheeseburger with everything on it—and extra bacon, of course—along with a large order of fries. Now the food was lying in his stomach like a lead brick, and he was beginning to wish he’d gone Sam’s route and had a salad. Although he would never admit that to his brother. If he did, he knew Sam would see that as an opportunity to convert him to the Cult of Good Nutrition, and he’d never hear the end of it.</p><p>“NuFlesh. That sound ominous to you?”</p><p>“Only a lot,” Sam said. He took a sip of his extra-large coffee. They’d stopped on the way to pick it up, and he’d ordered it black this time, with two shots of espresso.</p><p>Dean was frustrated. Despite the fact that Sam had convinced him that dealing with Frankenmutt might lead them to some kind of new weapon they could use against Dick Roman, the longer they spent in Brennan, the more antsy he was becoming. Roman and the other Leviathan were out there, stuffing their fanged faces with human flesh while continuing to advance their plans for world conquest, and the shape-shifting sons of bitches weren’t about to put their program on hold while the Winchester brothers tended to other business. The Leviathan were like a deadly disease that would continue to spread unchecked unless something was done about it, and hanging around this podunk town ganking freakshow dogs wasn’t doing anything to stop them.</p><p>It didn’t help that Sam seemed to be even fewer fries short of a Happy Meal than usual. Dean was certain his brother had experienced some sort of hallucination in the woods that he didn’t want to talk about, and he was guzzling coffee like it was water and he was a man crossing the Sahara on foot. Dean was no stranger to the concept of self-medicating, but he wasn’t sure what Sam hoped to accomplish by loading up on caffeine. It seemed to him that all that stimulation would only make Sam jittery and anxious, which in turn would make it harder for him to keep control of his mental state. Then again, Dean preferred “medicine” that took the edge off rather than sharpened it, so maybe it was simply a matter of to each his own. Still, he was determined to keep an eye on Sam which, he had to admit to himself, was pretty much what he normally did. So in a way, when it came to the Winchesters’ screwed up lives, he supposed everything was more or less normal.</p><p>It didn’t help his mood that Frankenmutt’s corpse was starting to stink up the crapmobile big-time. The monster dog was in the trunk, wrapped in a couple motel towels, but its stink had filtered through the car’s interior, and was making his already queasy stomach worse.</p><p><em>Definitely a salad next time,</em> he thought. <em>Maybe a taco salad, with extra meat, salsa, and sour cream.</em></p><p>“I like it better when the things we kill disintegrate when they die,” he said. “Less mess to deal with.”</p><p>“Definitely less stink,” Sam agreed. “I’m not sure, but I think Frankenmutt’s decaying faster than normal. Which only makes sense if it was made out of parts of already dead dogs. Once it’s dead—or dead again, I guess—whatever force was arresting the decomposition process is gone, and so—“</p><p>“It’s bye-bye Frankenmutt, hello nasty pile of rotting meat.”</p><p>“Pretty much. I just hope there’s enough left by the time we get to NuFlesh.”</p><p>“You really think the guy that owns the place can help us?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But you saw the pictures on their site. The kind of stuff they make looks an awful lot like those weird scar lines on Frankenmutt.”</p><p>When they had returned to the motel room, Sam had gotten on the Internet and worked his tech geek mojo until he found the NuFlesh website. It had taken him a while, which surprised Dean. Usually Sam could find information on the net as easily as Dean could find beef jerky on a convenience store shelf, but considering Sam’s starting point was little more than the search term “weird scars,” he supposed it was impressive that he’d come up with anything at all.</p><p>NuFlesh was in the business of making artificial skin that, according to the website, had “profound medical applications that could eventually change the world.” From what Dean had seen, though, they still had quite a way to go before they could fulfill that promise. The stuff looked more like flesh-colored rubber than actual skin, and when it was applied to a person, it looked far less natural than skin grafts did. Sam had also discovered—buried deep in the site so that it wouldn’t be obvious to the casual browser—that the success record of NuFlesh was, to put it kindly, modest. It didn’t sound to Dean like the stuff worked well enough to patch a paper cut, let alone hold together a bunch of dead doggy parts. But he had to admit, it did look kind of like Frankenmutt’s scars, so he supposed talking to NuFlesh’s creator was worth a shot. With any luck, he’d turn out to be the Dr. Frankenstein they were looking for, and they could get the hunt over with and get back to what really mattered: taking down Dick Roman and his army of oversized piranha.</p><p>“Speaking of Frankenmutt, how’s that bite doing?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam took another sip of his hi-test coffee. “Good. Still no sign of infection.” He crossed his legs and pulled up the cuff of his jeans to show Dean where he’d been bitten. True to his word, the skin there looked healthy. The bite marks were scabbed over, and there was no swelling or reddening, not even any bruising. Dean found the latter a bit odd. Frankenmutt wouldn’t have won any beauty contests when he was alive, but he’d been at least as strong as an ordinary dog, if not stronger. The pressure of his bite should have left some kind of mark on Sam to accompany the puncture wounds caused by his teeth, but there was nothing. Maybe Dean had overestimated the monster dog’s strength—or maybe not. It was one more thing to keep his eye on.</p><p>It didn’t take them long to find NuFlesh Biotech. Dean was surprised to discover the business was located in a strip mall.</p><p>“It’s not exactly what I expected,” he said.</p><p>“What did you think we’d find? A rundown castle with a giant lightning rod jutting from one of the towers and a hunchbacked assistant lurking behind a parapet?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “No, but I figured it would look more... I don’t know, sciencey.”</p><p>He pulled the car into a space in front of NuFlesh and parked.</p><p>“It <em>is</em> a start-up company,” Sam pointed out. “This is probably the best location they can afford.”</p><p>Dean shut off the ignition. He grimaced as the car’s engine juddered and knocked a couple times before cutting out. God, he missed the Impala!</p><p><em>We’ll be together again, baby,</em> he thought. <em>Soon as Daddy kills Dick Roman.</em></p><p>“Maybe so,” Dean said, “but it doesn’t have any style. It looks more like a dry cleaner’s than the lair of an evil genius.”</p><p>“We don’t have any proof yet that Dr. Martinez had anything to do with Frankenmutt. And even if he did, why would he want to advertise that he’s Brennan’s version of Dr. Frankenstein? Look at the Leviathan. They might be ancient creatures from the dawn of creation, but they adapted to the modern world right away. They blend in. Maybe that’s what Martinez is doing.”</p><p>“That’s another thing. Martinez—it’s not a good mad doctor name. Frankenstein, Jekyll, Moreau, Phibes. Those are creepy names. Martinez, not so much.”</p><p>They got out of the car. Sam finished off his coffee and tossed the empty cup into a trash receptacle on the sidewalk in front of NuFlesh. As they walked toward NuFlesh’s front door, Dean could smell that they’d both been perfumed with <em>eau de Frankenmutt.</em> He figured they’d need to get their suits dry cleaned after this was over. For a brief moment, he was grateful that they weren’t driving the Impala. He’d have hated his baby getting all funked up with dead monster dog stink.</p><p>Inside the small reception area, it quickly became clear they smelled worse than Dean feared. The office assistant—a bird-thin woman in her fifties with braided white hair—pursed her lips and turned her head slightly to the side as she spoke with them in a futile attempt to keep her nose as far away from their stench as possible. They showed her their fake bureau IDs, she made a quick call, and a moment later a side door opened and Dr. Peter Martinez came striding out.</p><p><em>Now that’s more like it,</em> Dean thought, and was instantly ashamed of himself. The man had obviously suffered serious burn injuries sometime in the past.</p><p>Dean knew better than to judge anyone based on their appearance. At least anyone human. When it came to supernatural predators, however, most of the time you really could judge a book by its cover. If something looked like it wanted to eat your flesh or devour your soul, it probably did.</p><p>Even though Dean knew better, he couldn’t help thinking that Martinez’s burn scars made him look like a perfect evil scientist. Of course, his clothes could use some work. A flannel shirt, jeans, and running shoes didn’t scream <em>I’m a guy who stitches together pieces of dead people in my lab!</em> Maybe if he added a white coat with a few bloodstains on it...</p><p>“I’m Dr. Martinez.” He smiled, the unscarred corner of his mouth rising higher than the other. He shook Dean’s hand, then Sam’s. “How can I help you gentlemen?”</p><p>Dean found himself staring at the man’s burn-scarred flesh. He’d seen plenty of scars in his time—hell, he had more than a few of his own, as did Sam—and he wasn’t normally put off by them, but now that Martinez stood only a couple feet from them, Dean could see that there was something not quite right about his. They were moist and glistening, as if coated with petroleum jelly, and the flesh sagged. The whole effect made Martinez look as if he were a wax figure that was in the process of slowly melting.</p><p>Dean glanced at Sam, and could tell by his brother’s expression that he found the man’s strange scars equally disturbing. More telling than that, though, was the office manager’s reaction. When Martinez had first appeared, she’d gasped, and now her eyes were wide, as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Whatever was going on with Martinez’s scars, it wasn’t normal.</p><p>Dean revised his earlier judgment. Dr. Martinez was definitely a candidate for Brennan’s local mad scientist.</p><p>Sam started to introduce them, but halfway through he broke into a huge yawn.</p><p>“Sorry,” he mumbled. “Late night on the job.”</p><p>Dean shot him a look. “As my partner was saying, we’ve been called in to help with the investigation into the strange deaths that have occurred here in town over the last few days. We think you might be able to help.”</p><p>Dean watched Martinez closely for any reaction to the mention of the wasting deaths that he’d come to think of as The Pruning, but the man appeared to have none beyond puzzlement.</p><p>“I’m a biochemist, not a disease specialist. I’m not sure I can be of much use to you.”</p><p>“We think the deaths might have a link to NuFlesh,” Sam said. “Not the company itself so much as your product.”</p><p>Martinez frowned. “I don’t see how that’s possible. Not only doesn’t NuFlesh create any kind of side effects that could account for those deaths, the product’s still in the development stage and isn’t in wide use in the public sector. In fact, I don’t know of anyone in town that has a NuFlesh graft.”</p><p>The man reached up to scratch at the sagging scarred flesh on the side of his face in what looked to Dean like a nervous habit. His fingernails opened thin runnels in the puckered skin that immediately filled with a yellowish fluid, but he didn’t seem to notice. Dean’s stomach did a flip.</p><p><em>Salad. Next time, for sure.</em></p><p>“We’ve got something we’d like you to look at,” Sam said. “It’ll only take a moment of your time, and we’d really appreciate it.”</p><p>Sam kept his gaze fastened on Martinez’s eyes, and Dean knew his brother was trying not to stare at the fluid-filled lines the man had carved into his face.</p><p>“Of course. Glad to help.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Sam said. “It’s outside.”</p><p>As the three of them left the office, Dean saw that the office manager had gone pale. Between enduring the stink of Frankenmutt’s corpse that clung to them and seeing her boss mutilate himself, she looked like she too was regretting whatever she’d chosen to have for lunch.</p><p>Dean’s stomach gurgled. <em>I know just how you feel, sister,</em> he thought.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam would have killed for another coffee right then, maybe with three shots of espresso this time. He was having a hell of a time keeping his eyes open, and he was beginning to think that it was more than simple weariness. Maybe it was his body’s reaction to having to struggle against the madness that roiled within him. Fighting the crazy took a lot out of him, and it was only natural that it took a toll on his energy levels. He wondered how much longer he could keep going like this before his system had had enough and went into full shutdown. Maybe instead of just crashing in some motel room for a few hours, he’d slip into a deep slumber from which he’d never awaken. He was surprised to find that the thought didn’t scare him. It was actually kind of comforting, in a weird way. He’d read about very old people who looked forward to dying, seeing it as a chance to lay down the burdens they’d carried for so long and finally rest. Given everything that had happened to him already in his relatively young life, he understood that attitude better than most people his age, but he never thought he’d end up feeling that way himself. <em>Getting a little too morbid,</em> he told himself. Best antidote for that was to concentrate on the job at hand.</p><p>One good thing: at least he hadn’t hallucinated Dr. Martinez’s oozing, sagging scar tissue. He could tell from Dean’s reaction that he’d seen and was disturbed by it, too. So, that was a relief. Sam had no idea what could cause the man’s scar tissue to ooze like that. As far as he knew, old scars didn’t suppurate. He wondered if Martinez had tried using his formula for NuFlesh to repair his face. Though he had said that the product was still in development. If that was the case, then maybe the weird scar lines on Frankenmutt had nothing to do with NuFlesh, which would mean that he and Dean were, to coin a pun, barking up the wrong tree.</p><p>They reached the car and Dean opened the trunk.</p><p>“This is the best the bureau can afford?” Martinez said as he eyed the ancient vehicle.</p><p>“Budget cutbacks,” Dean said without missing a beat. “You know how it is.”</p><p>A truly horrendous stench wafted from the trunk’s interior, causing all three of them to take a step backward. Sam was grateful it was November. He didn’t want to think about how bad Frankenmutt would have smelled if it had been August.</p><p>“What in the hell <em>is</em> that?” Martinez said, hand clamped over the lower half of his face in what Sam knew was a futile attempt to block out the stink.</p><p>“You tell us.” Dean threw back the top of the blanket covering Frankenmutt and exposed the creature’s ravaged corpse.</p><p>Dr. Martinez stared at the beast, but Sam and Dean kept their gazes focused on him. They were looking for some sign of recognition in the man’s eyes, but all Sam saw in his expression was disgust. Either the man was a damn good actor, or he had never seen Frankenmutt before. Then his disgust turned to confusion and then curiosity. He lowered his hand from his face and stepped forward to get a closer look.</p><p>“Is this a <em>dog?”</em></p><p>“From the looks of it, more like several,” Dean said.</p><p>Martinez leaned even closer, and Sam was impressed that he could do so without gagging. He reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew a pen. Using it as a probe, he touched the tip to the fleshy line dividing Frankenmutt’s rear leg from his body.</p><p>“I see now why you wanted to consult me. This material resembles NuFlesh.”</p><p>“Resembles?” Sam said.</p><p>Martinez continued poking at Frankenmutt with his pen. “The color and texture are both somewhat different. It’s more pliable than NuFlesh, more like the actual skin.”</p><p>“But it <em>is</em> artificial,” Sam pressed.</p><p>“Undoubtedly.” Martinez gave him a quick lopsided smile. “Whatever this thing is, I think it’s safe to say it wasn’t born this way.”</p><p>Dean gave Sam an exasperated look.</p><p>Undaunted, Sam continued. “Assuming that this... animal is what it appears to be, could NuFlesh—or something like it—be used to join the separate parts together?”</p><p>“Like some kind of meat glue,” Dean added.</p><p>Martinez straightened and stepped back away from the trunk. Sam noticed he didn’t return his pen to his pocket. Sam didn’t blame him.</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>“Humor those of us without PhDs in biochemistry,” Dean said.</p><p>Martinez thought for a moment. As he did, he scratched at his face again. The scar tissue broke and oozed more fluid, and sagged another fraction of an inch.</p><p>“I designed NuFlesh as an artificial substance for use in skin grafts, though I’ve always thought it could one day be employed in transplants. But that’s only in theory. Such applications are years, maybe even decades, away.” He looked at Frankenmutt again. “Even if someone has managed to develop their own NuFlesh formula that’s more advanced than mine, the hurdles they’d have to overcome to create a thing like this are staggering. Fusing bone, connecting muscles and nerves... Why the problems with tissue rejection alone—“</p><p>“We get the picture,” Dean interrupted. “It’s not exactly the kind of thing you can do with a junior mad scientist kit and a little old-fashioned elbow grease.”</p><p>“Hardly,” Martinez agreed. “I’m confident in saying that no one on Earth has the capability to make an abomination like this. Although why anyone would want to is beyond me. You believe it has some connection to the recent spate of mysterious deaths?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Dean drew the blanket back over Frankenmutt’s corpse and closed the trunk. “We figured people took one look at it, and died from an overdose of ugly.”</p><p>Sam gave Dean a warning look, then turned to Martinez. “There’s no risk of contagion.”</p><p>“I assumed that was the case,” Martinez said, “or else you would’ve observed stricter containment protocols.” He glanced at the closed trunk. “Or any, for that matter. I mean, not even the federal government could be that stupid, right?”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean, but neither of them said anything.</p><p>“When you find out where that thing came from, please let me know,” Martinez said. “Professional curiosity, you understand. Now, if there’s nothing further, I do have work I should get back to.”</p><p>“One last question,” Dean said. “Could this artificial flesh stuff be used to make a guy with two heads and four arms?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Peter stood on the sidewalk outside his business and watched the agents drive away in their ancient wreck of a car, taking the corpse of the misbegotten creature—and its horrendous stink—with them. After they had gone, he took his phone from his pocket and keyed in Conrad’s number. While he waited for him to answer, he idly scratched his face. The Itch was mild, far better than it had been, but it still bothered him. When he was done speaking with Conrad, he’d go back inside and apply more of the man’s special unguent. True, Conrad had cautioned him against using too much, but it was the only thing that gave Peter any relief. Really, what was the worst that could happen?</p><p>He didn’t feel the viscous fluid that oozed from the furrows he gouged in his scarred flesh, and even if he had, he probably wouldn’t have cared.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The embalming room in the basement of Harrison Brauer’s Legacy Center—in plainer language, a funeral parlor—was cramped and clammy, although he preferred to think of it as cozy and cool. The colorless walls and tiled floor seemed to glow in the stark fluorescent light, and if he spent too much time working down here, his eyes would start to water. If it got really bad, he’d don a pair of sunglasses, making him, at least in his own mind, the hippest mortician in town. The air held an iron tang that he’d long ago gotten used to, and which, truth to tell, he’d come to find rather pleasant. A pair of white marble tables occupied the center of the chamber, and above them a metal showerhead hung from the ceiling, just in case Harrison needed to wash away a particularly nasty spill. Set into the floor between the tables was a large grated drain, which he often thought of as a perfect metaphor for the end of life. Ultimately, everything that lived ended up washed down the Great Drain of the Universe.</p><p>Next to one of the tables was a gurney, and lying face up on it, naked, was Mason McKelvey, owner of McKelvey’s Motorama, Brennan’s most successful used car dealership. He’d been brought in less than an hour before, after spending the last nine days of his life in a hospital bed as his kidneys slowly ceased functioning. A shame, really, as he’d only been in his early sixties; not young, but then again, not all that old, either. Harrison had never bought a car from Mason—the funeral business had treated him well, and he could afford to purchase his vehicles new—but he knew the man from both the rotary club and the town’s merchants’ association. A nice enough fellow, if a bit loud and self-serving. Though as he’d been a salesman, and by all accounts, cold-blooded and ruthless when it came to forging a deal, Harrison figured the man’s jovial obnoxiousness was par for the course. When most people came to him, lying naked and statue-still, they seemed diminished somehow; smaller, sunken in on themselves, skin sallow and hard like wax figures. Mason was no exception. A thin man with a surprisingly thick shock of wild white hair, a sharp nose, and oversized ears, he appeared almost comical despite his current surroundings. Down here in the embalming room, there was nothing about Mason McKelvey to indicate the position of power and respect he’d held in life. Not for the first time, Mason thought that death truly was the great equalizer.</p><p>Harrison certainly understood how surface appearances didn’t always show the person within, for he himself defied the stereotype that most people had of morticians. Instead of looking like Gomez Addams—grim black suit, corpse-white complexion, mad gleam in his eyes—he was tall, ruddy-faced, and rotund, like a clean-shaven Santa Claus. His demeanor matched his appearance. He had a constant smile on his face, and he laughed often and easily, a loud infectious sound that came from deep in his chest, inviting everyone who heard it to join in.</p><p>Harrison shifted Mason from the gurney onto one of the marble tables with an ease born of equal parts strength and long practice. He wheeled the gurney into a corner of the room to get it out of the way, and then returned to consider Mason. The first steps in preparing a client for embalming are simple: scrub the skin, clean the nails, shampoo the hair, and then massage the limbs to break up rigor mortis. Then the mouth is sewn shut and the facial features carefully posed before the body stiffens. After that, the process becomes more involved. The blood is drawn, the stomach emptied, and the body filled with arterial firming fluid, which also gives the skin color. Harrison preferred using Index 32 lithol, which he purchased from a specialist supply company.</p><p>The tools of Harrison’s trade surrounded him: the trocar that emptied out his clients’ stomachs, the scalpels he used to dig into their arteries, the Duotronic pump that injected chemicals into their bodies, causing them to give off a vinegar-like scent. But he didn’t reach for any of these. Instead, he pulled open a drawer and removed a makeup kit. He placed it on the table next to Mason’s head, opened it, and went to work.</p><p>Half an hour later, he was finished. Harrison stepped back to admire the results.</p><p>He had covered Mason’s face, ears, and neck with white, outlined his lips with bright red to create a garish smile, and painted a large black dollar sign over each eye. On the left cheek he’d written the word “Buy” in black, and on the right he’d written “Sell.” He’d combed Mason’s hair up and back, sprayed it so it would remain in place, and then colored it green to represent money.</p><p>He removed a hand mirror from the makeup kit and held it in front of Mason’s new face. “What do you think? You’ve heard of a clown car, right? Well, now you’re a car clown!”</p><p>Harrison laughed, but evidently Mason didn’t get the joke, for he remained silent. <em>Screw him.</em> Harrison thought it was funny.</p><p>He returned the mirror to the kit, walked over to the counter, and picked up his camera. He then spent the next several minutes taking pictures of Mason from different angles.</p><p>“You know you’re just going to have to clean all that off.”</p><p>The voice startled Harrison, but he recognized it almost immediately. Instead of turning to look at the speaker, he continued shooting photos as he answered.</p><p>“I’ll admit that mine is a transitory art, but that’s what makes it so special. I reveal my clients’ inner nature, bring it to the surface for perhaps the first and only time since the day they were born, and then I restore the more familiar appearance their family and friends expect. But for a short interval at least, if only down here with me, they become their truest, most profound selves.”</p><p>Satisfied he’d gotten some good shots for his latest scrapbook—he’d already filled seven others—he lowered his camera and finally turned to face Conrad.</p><p>Conrad stepped forward from the shadowy corner where he’d been standing and approached the table where Mason lay. Harrison didn’t question how Conrad had managed to enter the embalming room without his hearing him. He knew that he became so focused when practicing his art—which he considered his true vocation—that a bomb could go off behind him and he’d barely notice. Besides, Conrad had a way of moving snake-silent when he wanted to.</p><p>Conrad glanced at Mason’s altered face. “I suppose it was his ears and nose that gave you the idea to make him up as a clown.”</p><p>“That, and the awful TV commercials he made for his dealership. He was one of those car salesmen who always talk too loud and fast when they’re on camera, you know?”</p><p>“Death shouldn’t be mocked like this,” Conrad said. “It is sacred.”</p><p>Harrison didn’t attach any mystic or religious significance to death. As far as he was concerned, it was only a biological process, no more important or meaningful than flipping off a light switch when you left a room.</p><p>“To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?” he asked to change the subject. “Should I assume that you’re in need of the kind of materials that only I can supply?”</p><p>“Thank you, but no. At the moment, I happen to be well stocked.”</p><p>Harrison frowned. “Nothing personal, but I didn’t take you to be the type to make social calls.”</p><p>“I’m not.” Mason’s body lay between them, but now Conrad began slowly walking around the table, approaching Harrison. “Do you remember when I first came to you?”</p><p>“Of course.” How could he forget the day a well-dressed, overly formal man entered his parlor and introduced himself as Conrad Dippel? Conrad—who looked far more like an archetypal mortician than Harrison ever would—had brought with him several containers of a material called NuFlesh and a business proposition.</p><p>“I sought you out for several reasons. One was your profession. It is an ancient and noble one which my lady well regards. Another was your surname: Bauer. It means <em>brewer</em> in German. My lady has always held a fondness for the Germanic people, and I myself am honored to claim that heritage as well.”</p><p>Harrison had heard Conrad speak of his <em>lady</em> before, but he had no idea who he was referring to. Some sort of supervisor, he supposed.</p><p>Conrad continued. “Not to mention the fact that you have access to certain ‘materials,’ as you call them, along with facilities suitable for working with them. Also, I asked around town about you and discovered you had a reputation for somewhat eccentric behavior. Not an uncommon prejudice when it comes to those who devote themselves to the funereal arts, I admit, but I found the rumors intriguing.”</p><p>Conrad had reached Harrison’s side of the table and now stood only inches from him. Given his height and girth, Harrison rarely felt physically threatened, but even though he outweighed Conrad by a good margin, he felt intimidated by the man, and it was all he could do to keep from shrinking back in his presence.</p><p>“However, after working together for several weeks, it became apparent to me that while you have sufficient...” He glanced at Mason’s clown face. “...imagination, you lack another quality vital to the success of my project.” He reached toward Mason’s face, and with his index finger wiped away a portion of white. He then slowly rubbed the makeup between thumb and forefinger, as if taking his time to get a feel for it. “Do you know what that quality is?”</p><p>Harrison sensed that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what. The emotional atmosphere in the room was like the building electrical charge in the moments before a thunderstorm broke loose, and he didn’t like it. Not one bit.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Medical training. It’s my own fault, of course. In my day, professions were less specialized than they are now, and scientific advances in biology, anatomy, and medicine, meager as they might have been, were often made by those who worked with the dead. I believed that my experience could make up for what you lacked, but I soon saw that this was hubris on my part. I could not fault your enthusiasm for the work, but our progress was slow, and my lady grows impatient. So when another candidate presented herself, one who had the medical training you lack, I decided to change horses in midstream, as I believe the saying goes.”</p><p>Harrison wondered where Conrad was going with all this. Wherever it was, he doubted it was anywhere good.</p><p>“I can’t say I wasn’t disappointed, but there wasn’t much I could do about it. Besides, you continued to pay me for services rendered, so I figured I couldn’t complain,” Harrison said.</p><p>Harvesting organs and even entire limbs from his clients posed little problem. The organs of course were never missed, and as for the limbs and even torsos, mannequin parts were effective substitutes. If necessary, the hands were gloved due to an unfortunate chemical “accident” that took place during the embalming process. Families were extremely unhappy at this—until Harrison offered them a discount to make up for the extra shock during their time of grief.</p><p>“But my assessment of your skill level turned out to be premature,” Conrad said. “Have you seen today’s paper?”</p><p>Harrison could now guess where the conversation was heading, and he really didn’t like it. “I don’t follow local news. Nothing interesting ever happens in Brennan.”</p><p>“Then it’s most fortunate that I happened to stop at a convenience store on my way over and purchase a copy. I discovered an article I think you might find intriguing, and I clipped it out for you.” He reached into an inner pocket of his jacket, removed a folded piece of newsprint, and held it out to Harrison.</p><p>Harrison didn’t take it right away. He kept the temperature cool in the embalming room—not out of any professional need, simply because he was more comfortable that way—but in the last few minutes the air had grown decidedly chilly. It could have been his imagination, but he didn’t think so. The drop in temperature felt like a sign of danger, the equivalent of an angry rattlesnake shaking its tail in warning. Because of this, Harrison stood frozen, unsure what to do—or not do—next. In the end he reached out and took the clipping from Conrad. He unfolded it, trying to convince himself that he only imagined the newsprint felt cold as ice, and read. It didn’t take long to get through the article, and when he was finished, he looked up and met Conrad’s gaze, although he really didn’t want to.</p><p>“I know you’re responsible for this monstrosity,” Conrad said, “so don’t insult my intelligence with a denial. You’re the only person in town, aside from myself and my current colleague, who could’ve hoped to even have a chance at restoring the dead to life, let alone...” His lips pursed in disgust. “...altering their physiognomy.”</p><p>Despite Conrad’s warning, Harrison nearly denied it anyway, but chose instead to remain silent.</p><p>“I had barely begun tutoring you in the alchemical arts, and the instruction I gave you was minimal at best,” Conrad continued. “You shouldn’t have been able to resurrect an insect, let alone a human.”</p><p>“He has two heads,” Harrison said. “Does that mean he counts as two people?”</p><p>“I understand why you did it.” Conrad glanced at the clown-faced corpse lying on the marble table. “Perhaps <em>understand</em> is too strong a word. I <em>recognize</em> that you have a proclivity for the outré in your work. What I don’t understand is <em>how</em> you accomplished it on your own. Pray, enlighten me.”</p><p>Harrison didn’t see how any good could come from his admitting the truth, but was so thrilled with what he’d done that he had to tell <em>someone</em>—even if that someone might kill him for it.</p><p>“I paid attention to you as you worked,” he said. “Much more attention that you realized. You carry an ancient leather-bound notebook with all sorts of alchemical formulae in it. You left it lying on the counter once, and I was able to flip through it while you were busy with other tasks. I may not have an eidetic memory, but my memory <em>is</em> excellent. Plus, I took pictures of the formulae with my phone for later reference. That information was all I needed to begin my search on the Internet. Then, after you moved on to a new assistant, I got to work. Most of the information I found was nonsense, but I knew what to look for, so I recognized it when I came across the real thing. Once I’d amassed enough knowledge about technique, all I needed was some NuFlesh. I paid a call on Dr. Martinez and told him that I was interested in trying out his wonderful new product as an alternative to mortician’s putty. He gladly sold me several boxes of the material. After that, it was mostly a process of trial and error. Getting hold of the proper chemicals, mixing them in the right proportions under the perfect conditions, performing the rites without a flaw...” He trailed off and gave Conrad an embarrassed smile. “I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know, am I?”</p><p>“You must have used fresh corpses. If any significant decay sets in—“</p><p>“The resurrected’s physical form won’t be stable, and will eventually rot away. I know. Despite the fact that I do have access to the bodies of the recently deceased, families would notice if any of their loved ones turned up missing. So I drove my hearse to Crichton—it’s fifty miles from here—found a pair of donors outside a bar late one night, and picked them up. It really wasn’t any trouble. Ether might be old-fashioned, but it’s a wonderfully effective hunting tool.”</p><p>“You assembled the creature here?” Conrad asked.</p><p>“Yes. I’ve taken to calling him Byron.” He paused, but Conrad gave no reaction. “By-ron? Bi? As in two? Two heads, get it?”</p><p>Conrad looked at him blankly.</p><p>Harrison sighed. It seemed neither the living nor the dead appreciated his sense of humor.</p><p>“And where is the <em>creature</em> now?”</p><p>“How should I know? He’s like a cat, comes and goes as he pleases. He sleeps in an old shed out back where I used to keep lawn equipment. Which works out well. I mean, I can hardly have a naked two-headed man running around inside when there’s a service going on, can I?”</p><p>He thought for a moment. “Do you think Byron will eventually become Brennan’s version of Bigfoot? I hope so. It would be good for the tourist—“</p><p>Before he could say the word “trade,” Conrad’s right hand shot out and grabbed hold of his throat, cutting off both his voice and his air. Conrad’s hand was so cold it burned Harrison’s flesh. He gripped Conrad’s arm with both of his hands and tried to break free, but even though the man didn’t look all that strong, his grip was like frost-covered iron, and Harrison couldn’t dislodge it.</p><p>“While I must admit to being impressed by your initiative, I can’t allow you to interfere with my plans. The last thing I need is any undue attention to be drawn—“</p><p>Conrad’s phone went off in his pocket. Harrison was surprised to hear it had a musical ring tone, and even more surprised that it was Blue Oyster Cult’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper.” Maybe the grim and oh-so-proper Mr. Dippel had a sense of humor after all.</p><p>Conrad maintained his grip on Harrison’s throat as he dug his phone out of his pants pocket with his left hand and answered the call.</p><p>“Hello?” He spoke that one word and no more. He just listened, scowl deepening and jaw clenching. His grip tightened too, and Harrison began to feel lightheaded, almost as if he was floating, and gray spots danced in his vision. He heard the sound of a vast amount of water—a river or even an ocean—roaring as it circled an unimaginably large drain, one that led down into a darkness blacker than any he’d ever conceived. He knew he’d soon be caught up in the swirling tide and swept down into that endless night. He wasn’t afraid, though, was rather looking forward to it, in fact. After working with death for so long, he was finally going to get to experience it for himself. His only regret was that he hadn’t specified in his will who he wanted to prepare his body for burial. There were a couple other morticians in town, but Harrison wouldn’t trust either of them to stuff a turkey, let alone work on his corpse. He supposed he’d have to take what he could get. It was too late to—</p><p>Conrad’s hand sprang open. Released from the man’s grip, Harrison fell to his hands and knees and sucked in wheezing lungfuls of air. It looked like he wasn’t going to die today. He was disappointed, but he consoled himself with the thought that the drain would be there waiting for him when his time came at last.</p><p>Into his phone, Conrad said, “You have my gratitude. I shall bring some more unguent by for you later as a thank you. No charge.”</p><p>He disconnected and put the phone back in his pocket.</p><p>“It seems the undue attention I spoke of has already come to us. You are fortunate the call came when it did, for now I have need of you.” He smiled. “For a while longer, at least. I want you to find this creature of yours, bring it here, confine it, and then contact me immediately.”</p><p>Harrison almost said, “And what if I don’t?” but he already knew the answer to that question, so he simply nodded.</p><p>Without another word, Conrad turned and left the chamber. As soon as he was gone, the temperature began to rise. Harrison got to his feet, still wheezing. He rubbed the frost burns on his throat. He’d do as Conrad ordered. He’d bring Byron home, and the two—or maybe it was three—of them would wait for the grim-faced prick to return. They’d have a surprise in store for Mr. Dippel. Oh yes they would.</p><p>Humming and ignoring his sore throat, Harrison turned his attention back to Mason. He wondered what the man would look like with a purple face. Like an eggplant with hair and eyes, he decided. He couldn’t wait to find out.</p><p>He withdrew a container of cleansing wipes from the makeup kit and began removing the white from Mason’s face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Have you guys ever done it?”</p><p>Sam’s cheeks burned, and he had to swallow before he could talk. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Trish rolled her eyes, but she smiled as she did so. “Gone hunting, I mean. Has your dad ever taken you?”</p><p>Sam was about to say no, but Dean kicked him in the leg. The three of them had been sitting at the kitchen table for the last hour playing euchre, although Sam had watched Trish more than the cards. During those rare moments when Sam wasn’t looking at Trish, he’d been checking on his brother to see if he was watching her, too. Of course he was. Trish was smart, funny, beautiful, with an air of sadness about her that Sam found irresistible. He was sure Dean felt the same way. How could he not? Most of the time Sam didn’t mind being the younger brother, but every once in a while, he caught Trish looking at Dean in a way she didn’t look at him, and he wished he was the oldest.</p><p>“Sure we have,” Dean said. “Lots of times.”</p><p>Sam gave his brother a look, but he didn’t say anything. Partly because he didn’t want to make Dean mad, but mostly because he didn’t want to look like a whiney little kid in front of Trish. He didn’t like lying to her, but—he rationalized—he wasn’t really. <em>Dean</em> was. Keeping your mouth shut wasn’t the same as lying, was it? But if that was the case, then why did he feel so lousy about it?</p><p>“That’s so cool!” Trish glanced over her shoulder at the basement door behind them. Even though it was closed, and had been the entire time they’d been playing, the nervous way she looked at it made Sam think she half expected her father to be standing there listening. Walter’s “workshop,” as he called it, was set up in the basement, and he’d been working down there for the last couple hours, forging whatever documents his hunter clientele needed.</p><p>She turned back to them. “Dad hates it whenever I ask anything about hunting.” She lowered her voice, even though there was no way her dad could have heard her from down in the basement. “My uncle was a hunter. He got killed by a werewolf.”</p><p>“Werewolves are bad-ass,” Dean said, almost admiringly. Then he looked at Trish, as if just realizing what he’d said. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “I wasn’t thinking.”</p><p>“What else is new?” Sam said with a smirk.</p><p>He hoped to score a couple points with Trish by getting a dig in, but when Dean kicked him in the leg again—much harder this time—he let out an <em>ow!</em> of pain, and he figured that cost him whatever coolness points he might have gained.</p><p>Trish lowered her gaze to the tabletop. “It was the same werewolf that killed my mom.”</p><p>“Damn,” Dean said. “I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“Me, too,” Sam hurried to say, although he wasn’t sure exactly what he was apologizing for. It just felt like the right thing to do.</p><p>Trish kept laying down cards as she spoke, and although Sam felt funny continuing to play the game considering the topic of conversation, he kept on, as did Dean.</p><p>“One summer my family was on a camping trip. I was only nine. My uncle Ryan—my mom’s brother—came along. He’d just gotten divorced from my aunt and was depressed. My parents thought the camping trip might help him get away, clear his head a little, you know?”</p><p>Sam didn’t know, not exactly, but he nodded anyway, as did Dean, who probably <em>did</em> really know—or at least had a better idea of what Trish was talking about.</p><p>“We went on a night hike. Dad hoped we’d see some bats, maybe spot some owls. Mom and Uncle Ryan came along, but before long he said he wasn’t feeling good and was going to head back to camp and turn in. He left, and after a couple minutes, Mom decided to go back, too. She didn’t say anything, but I figure she was worried that he planned to crawl into his tent and drink himself blind. Dad wanted all of us to go back, but Mom told him that it would be a shame for me to miss out on getting to experience the woods at night. Truth was, she probably wanted to keep me away from camp in case Ryan got upset with her for checking up on him and started yelling or something. Dad wasn’t worried about Mom finding her way back to camp on her own in the dark. They were both experienced campers and hikers, and they could handle themselves in the wild just fine. Besides, there was a full moon that night, so there was plenty of light to see by.”</p><p>She glanced at the basement door once again, as if reassuring herself that her father wasn’t going to open it any moment and walk through. After the better part of a minute passed, she resumed her story, continuing to play euchre as she spoke.</p><p>“I don’t know how much longer Dad and I kept hiking. Half an hour, maybe. Whatever it was, it was long enough. When we got back to camp, we found...” She trailed off and looked at the cards remaining in her hand, frowning as if she didn’t remember what they were for. “You know how in horror movies people can always hear the monster attack someone in the woods, no matter how far away they are? We didn’t hear anything at all. No growls or snarls. No screams. Only crickets chirping and night birds singing, as if everything was normal. Dad figures Uncle Ryan tried to fight off the werewolf and protect Mom, but even though he had a rifle with him, he never got off a shot. The damned thing was too fast. Not that it would’ve mattered, since he didn’t have silver bullets. When the werewolf finished with him, it went after Mom. She tried to run, but she didn’t get far from camp before it caught up to her and took her down. She ran in the opposite direction from where Dad and I were. She was trying to lead the werewolf away from us.”</p><p>She stared at the cards for another moment before tossing them onto the table. A second later, Dean did the same, and Sam followed his brother’s lead.</p><p>“What happened to the werewolf?” Dean asked.</p><p>“A couple hunters—your kind of hunters, not the regular kind—had been on its trail for several weeks. They finally tracked it down and killed it before dawn. Stabbed it in the heart with a silver blade. If they’d only found it a few hours earlier...”</p><p>None of them spoke for several moments. It was Dean who eventually broke the silence.</p><p>“It was your aunt, wasn’t it?” he said. “The werewolf, I mean.”</p><p>Trish nodded. “The hunters found us sometime after sunrise. We were still in the camp, both of us in shock. From what they told us, when people change into werewolves they become mindless animals, filled with nothing but hunger, hate, and rage. But some unconscious part of them is driven to prey on those they view as a threat, or who they have some kind of grudge against.” She forced a smile. “My aunt and uncle didn’t exactly have an amicable divorce.” Her smile faded. “I’m thirsty. Do you guys want a drink?”</p><p>The brother shook their heads. Trish got up from the table, went to the sink, filled a glass with tap water, and drank it straight down. She then put the empty glass in the sink and leaned on the counter, arms crossed as she continued her story.</p><p>“Dad didn’t believe the hunters at first. Who would? But they eventually convinced him that what they claimed was true, and they advised him not to say anything about werewolves when he reported the deaths. He agreed and the hunters brought my aunt’s body to our camp and... made it look like she was attacked by an animal, too. Dad and I stayed away while they did it. After what had happened to Mom and Ryan, it was the last thing either of us wanted to witness. Then the hunters wished us good luck and left. We got in our pickup and Dad drove us to town to report what had happened.</p><p>“The next several days were pretty awful, as you might imagine. Dad told the police that my aunt had come along on the camping trip as a last-ditch effort to fix their marriage. He told them he’d taken me on a hike before dawn so we could watch the sunrise together while the others slept. He said that everyone was dead when we got back, and so we jumped in the pickup and raced to town. The police suspected my dad of committing the murders at first, and I think they might’ve continued if I hadn’t backed up his story. After we’d buried everyone, the hunters stopped by our home to see how we were doing. Dad asked them dozens of questions about what it was like to be a hunter, how many of the monsters everyone thought were pretend were actually real, and how he could become a hunter, too. But even filled with sorrow and anger as he was, it was obvious to the hunters that my dad was too gentle a man to follow in their footsteps. As Dad taught art at a local college, that gave the hunters an idea, though. They said that in their line of work they often needed official-looking documents and identification. They didn’t use the word counterfeit, maybe because I’d refused to leave Dad’s side since the murders and they didn’t want to say anything in front of me that made them look like criminals. They said they had a hard time finding anyone to make such documents, let alone someone who could do it right. That’s how Dad started working in, as he calls it, ‘hunter support.’”</p><p>After she was finished, she swallowed. “I’m still so thirsty. Guess I talked a lot, huh?” She turned around and refilled her water glass.</p><p>Sam felt sorry for Trish, but he didn’t know what to say or do. His own mother had died when Sam was a baby, so he felt sympathy for Trish’s loss, but he couldn’t say that he shared it, exactly. He’d never gotten the chance to know his mom, but Trish had been nine when hers had died. Because of that, her mom’s death must have hit her so much harder than he could imagine. In a weird way, though, he was jealous of her. At least she’d had nine years with her mom. She had photos of the two of them together, maybe even videos. If so, she’d always be able to watch them and know what her mother’s voice sounded like, how she moved, how she smiled. Trish had <em>memories</em> of her mom. He didn’t have any of his, not a single one.</p><p>Trish stood at the sink, her back to them, when the glass suddenly shattered in her hand.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, Sam.” Her voice had changed. It was deeper, guttural. “You’re jealous of me. You think you had it worse than me because your mom died when you were a baby. You know what? That’s makes me angry.”</p><p>She turned around. Her eyes had become a feral yellow, her fingernails had lengthened into cruel, hooked claws, and her mouth was filled with sharp teeth.</p><p>“<em>Very</em> angry.”</p><p>She raised her clawed hands and ran snarling toward Sam and Dean, spittle running from the corners of her mouth, hunger blazing in her eyes.</p><p>Sam only had time to think <em>I’m sorry</em> before she tore into him.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam woke up to what he first thought was an earthquake, but he quickly realized it was just Dean shaking him by the shoulders.</p><p>“I’m awake,” he said, pushing Dean away from him.</p><p>“It’s about damn time! I’ve been shaking you for almost five minutes, but you didn’t respond. I was about to give up and haul your ass to the nearest hospital.”</p><p>Sam glanced around, still foggy-brained. He was sitting in the passenger seat of the crapmobile, seatbelt unbuckled. The passenger door was open and Dean stood outside, looking equal parts worried and pissed.</p><p>“Guess I dropped off. Sorry.” He hauled himself out of the car and nearly fell when his legs buckled underneath his weight. He managed to grab hold of the open door and keep himself upright, but it was a near thing. His body felt heavy and slow, as if it was filled with wet sand.</p><p>“Dude, something’s wrong with you!” Dean said.</p><p>“I’m fine. Well, no, I’m not, but all I am is tired. Once in a while everything catches up with you. After we’ve taken care of whatever’s going on in this town, I’ll zonk out and sleep as long as it takes to get my energy back, all right? Until then, I’ll just have to make do.”</p><p>Dean still didn’t look happy, but he didn’t protest, which as far as Sam was concerned, was good enough. Trying to look as if he wasn’t fighting to stay awake, he glanced around to see where they were. Dean had parked the car on a gravel shoulder. Trees lined both sides of a narrow blacktopped country lane that had no lines painted on it.</p><p><em>Back road,</em> Sam thought. <em>Probably not too far outside town.</em></p><p>His dream came back to him then, images and emotions slamming into his mind with sledgehammer force. He drew in a surprised breath, and Dean looked alarmed. He started forward, but Sam waved him off.</p><p>“I’m okay. I just remembered what I dreamed about during the drive, that’s all.”</p><p>Dean’s eyes narrowed as if he were scrutinizing Sam, trying to decide whether he was telling the truth or attempting to cover up how bad his condition really was.</p><p>“It was about Trish again,” he said.</p><p>Dean relaxed a bit. “Another rough one, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah. It started out normal enough. It was about the euchre game when she told us how her mom and uncle died. Remember?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “Like it was yesterday.”</p><p>“But at the end it turned... weird.”</p><p>For a second, he was afraid Dean was going to ask him how weird, but he was grateful that his brother didn’t press him for more details.</p><p>They looked at each other for a few moments without speaking.</p><p>“Maybe your crazy’s starting to affect your dreams,” Dean said. “It could be a good sign. Instead of producing hallucinations, your brain is shifting over to having regular old bad dreams. Maybe in time they’ll fade, too.”</p><p>Sam thought about the shadowy figure he’d seen when they’d carried Frankenmutt’s corpse to the car.</p><p>“Maybe,” he said, trying not to sound doubtful. He changed the subject. “So—why are we here?”</p><p>“Maybe you’re so tired lately because you’re catching a cold,” Dean said. “Your nose has got to be clogged with snot, otherwise you’d smell why we’re here.”</p><p>Sam frowned, drew in a deep breath through his nose, and regretted it instantly. Even though they were standing outside of the car, the stink of Frankenmutt was overpowering. Sam wondered if maybe Dean was right and something was wrong with him. How else could he have missed the beast’s rank odor of decay? Was it possible for anyone to be <em>that</em> sleepy? Maybe it was his crazy again. If his mind could make him think he was seeing and hearing things that weren’t there, maybe it could make him unable to perceive something that was. The thought wasn’t a comforting one.</p><p>“I take it that this is where we say goodbye to Frankenmutt,” Sam said.</p><p>“Stinkenstein. I changed his name. And yeah, if we don’t dump his rotting carcass soon, we’ll never be able to get his Frankenfunk off of us.”</p><p>Sam gave his brother a look. “You’re having way too much fun with the Franken-names.”</p><p>“In this job, you take the perks where you can get them. C’mon, help me haul its corpse into the woods. Then we can go back to the motel and take a couple dozen showers apiece.”</p><p>“You think we should burn it?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “Yeah. So far it hasn’t shown any signs that it’s going to get back up and start tearing people’s throats out, but why take chances? If nothing else, burning it will kill the stink—I hope.”</p><p>“Sounds like a plan. Fire always works in Frankenstein movies, right?”</p><p>“That’s what I was thinking. Then again, fire kills just about everything. That’s the beauty of it.”</p><p>The brothers headed to the rear of the car, and Dean inserted the key into the trunk lock, but he didn’t turn it right away. “You might want to try and breathe through your mouth for the next few minutes.”</p><p>Sam nodded and Dean began to turn the key. His phone rang. Leaving the key in the lock, he pulled out his phone and answered it.</p><p>“Hello?” He listened, then glanced at Sam. “Yeah, this is he. Who’s this?” He listened some more. “Sure, yeah, I’ll be there as soon as possible.” He disconnected and tucked the phone back in his pocket.</p><p>“Who was it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Local police. They found the card we left with Lyle Swanson—on his body. His withered, dried-up body. We got ourselves another victim of The Pruning.”</p><p>“Think the Double-Header paid him a return visit?”</p><p>“That’d be my guess. Whoever’s making these monsters, it’s like they’ve got a damn assembly line going. Let’s go torch Stinkenstein and haul ass over to Lyle’s.”</p><p>Dean turned the key and the trunk popped open. A stench wave hit them like a solid wall, and both brothers took a couple steps backward.</p><p>“Can’t we just burn him right there in the trunk?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Tempting, but we might blow up the car in the process. Not that it would be any great loss,” Dean added. “C’mon, the sooner we get this over with, the better.”</p><p>Sam nodded, and they got to work. One good thing about the stench: at least it kept him awake.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad knelt naked on the floor of what once was the warehouse for Kingston Bicycles. The facility had no electricity and hadn’t for many years, but that didn’t trouble him. The warehouse’s windows were dirty and streaked, but enough light filtered through for his needs. Besides, electric light was still something of a novelty to Conrad. He’d gotten by for the majority of his long existence with candles or lamplight. Just because the world had changed didn’t mean he had to as well. Sometimes the old ways were best.</p><p>Case in point: hanging from the rafters in front of him was a piglet. He’d purchased the animal from a local farmer several days before, and had kept it tied up in a corner of the warehouse on a bed of sawdust with straw scattered over it. He’d made sure the animal had plenty of food and water—it was important that it be healthy and strong—and when he’d gotten the chance, he’d even taken it out for short walks to give it some exercise. Now it dangled at the end of a rope, wriggling and squealing, back hooves bound tight, head pointed at the floor. Conrad didn’t mind the noises the animal made. On the contrary, he appreciated them, for they were sounds of life, and the more life the piglet had in it, the better.</p><p>The tools Conrad had brought with him were simple. A stone bowl and knife, very old and worn from much use, both emblazoned with ancient runes. If a linguistics scholar had been present, he or she might have recognized the runes as being similar to those used by the Norse people, but these symbols predated those by centuries. The bowl rested directly beneath the squirming piglet, and next to it, the blade pointed north. The bowl was named Hunger, and the knife called Famine.</p><p>Conrad closed his eyes, bowed his head, and then spoke in a reverent voice. The language he used was a forerunner of Old Norse.</p><p>“Hel, <em>Frau Holle,</em> Dark Mother, Guardian of Graves, Queen of Night Unending, I beg you to accept this sacrifice from your most unworthy of servants.”</p><p>This particular sacrifice wasn’t as elaborate as those conducted in the old days, long before Conrad’s birth. Back then, entire villages would sacrifice pigs and horses, boiling the meat in large cooking pits, and sprinkling the animals’ blood on statues of their deities. The villagers would eat the meat, drink mead, and pray for a good year and peace. In some villages, during every ninth year there was a <em>blotan</em>—or sacrificial—feast of nine days, during which nine males of each species, men included, were sacrificed, their bodies hung from the branches of trees near the temple. The most devout villages sacrificed ninety-nine people—men, women, and children—and although Conrad admired their devotion, few villages were large enough to survive the loss of so much of their population every nine years.</p><p>Conrad knew rites such as the one he was about to perform were more symbolic than literal, but he’d served Hel for over three hundred years, and he knew that the dark goddess, while understanding the necessity of a downsized sacrifice in the modern world, still expected her servants to get the basics right, to cross their T’s and dot their I’s, as it were.</p><p>He opened his eyes, picked up Famine, and touched the blade’s tip to the sacred nine points of life on his body: the genitals (from which life sprung), the heart (which pumped blood), the nose, the mouth, and both lungs (all involved in breathing), the stomach (which digested food), the forehead (behind which lay the brain), and lastly his right hand (which held weapons and tools with which to fight, hunt, and build). Holding Famine with his left hand, he carved a single rune into the flesh of his right palm. To a modern English speaker, the symbol would have resembled a large X, but it stood for the word <em>gebo,</em> meaning gift. Conrad waited until the blood was flowing strongly, and then pressed his palm against the side of the piglet. He returned Famine to his right hand, gripping the stone handle tight so his blood smeared it, then carved the rune for <em>gebo</em> into the piglet—the animal now squealing in terror—until its blood mingled with his own, mystically linking the two of them. Conrad and the piglet were now one, and the sacrifice of its life would substitute for the sacrifice of his. That is, if he’d done everything right. If not, Hel would take his life along with the piglet’s. After three centuries, he could perform this ritual in his sleep, but that didn’t mean he was incapable of making a mistake, and even the smallest flaw might upset his lady. He hoped that if she found his sacrifice wanting, she would forgive him, if for no other reason than because she still had need of him.</p><p>He grabbed hold of the back of the piglet’s neck to keep it steady, and then with a single swift, practiced swipe, he sliced open the animal’s throat. Blood poured from the wound and into Hunger below. Conrad held the blade beneath the flow to wet it, and then flicked it toward each of the sacred nine points of his body, splashing himself with the piglet’s blood. He then placed Famine on the floor next to Hunger, pressed his wounded hand over his heart, closed his eyes, and waited. He listened as the sound of blood splatter lessened, became a trickle, then slowed to intermittent drops. When it stopped at last, he opened his eyes.</p><p>Hunger was filled with dark blood, but as Conrad watched, the level began to lower. Within moments, the blood was gone, absorbed into the stone. He smiled. Hel had accepted his sacrifice.</p><p>He bowed his head.</p><p>“My lady, two men have come to Brennan. I believe they intend to interfere with our plans, and I ask for the means to track them, so I might slay them before they can cause us further difficulty.”</p><p>Someone else might have asked Hel to strike the two men dead, but he knew the dark queen preferred her servants practice self-reliance. The gods help those who help themselves.</p><p>For several moments, nothing happened, and Conrad began to fear that his lady had forsaken him. Then he heard a voice whisper in his mind, the words like a midnight wind blowing across the icy surface of a frozen lake.</p><p><em>So it shall be.</em></p><p>The rune he’d carved into his palm erupted with fresh pain far more intense than anything a mere cut could cause. It was a cold pain, but a cold so strong it burned like fire. He gritted his teeth and pulled his hand away from his chest. He watched as the blood that still welled forth from the X he’d carved into himself froze and became crimson ice. The pain worsened and the sensation of cold spread through his body. He began to shiver. Despite the cold sensation, sweat poured off of him as he fought to endure the agony. Finally, just as the pain had become so bad that he was considering snatching up Famine with his left hand and hacking off his right, the sensation began to lessen. Within moments, it was gone, leaving behind only a dull, distant throbbing.</p><p>He examined his palm. The blood was gone and the wound healed, leaving behind an X-shaped black scar. Conrad held his hand straight out before him experimentally. He felt the cold return, though far less painfully this time, and only on the left edge of the rune. He moved his hand leftward, and the cold spread farther, until it covered the entire rune. He smiled. Hel had given him the equivalent of a compass to track the two meddlers. The rune was indeed now a <em>gebo</em>—a gift—but now a gift from the goddess instead of to her.</p><p>He inclined his head in gratitude. “I praise your eternal darkness, my lady.”</p><p>He rose to his feet, ready to begin the hunt. Then he glanced down at his body, splattered with blood from the ritual. Perhaps he should clean himself up first. He looked at the dead piglet dangling over the empty stone bowl. Maybe he should avail himself of the opportunity for some sustenance, too. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten, and he was <em>so</em> fond of raw pig heart.</p><p>He bent down, picked up Famine, and started cutting.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Did you see the way those cops reacted to us?” Dean asked. “Now I know why they call it getting the stink eye. We reek!”</p><p>“At least our stench will keep them out of the house while we check the scene,” Sam said. They’d stopped on the drive over for yet another coffee for Sam, and he sipped it now.</p><p>“No need for that,” Dean said. “They’re already too worried about catching whatever plague they think is responsible for The Pruning. They don’t want to spend any more time in here than they have to.”</p><p>“Whatever works,” Sam said, and took another sip of coffee. “I mean, they were in such a hurry to get out, they didn’t question the logic of agents posing as reporters to question Lyle.”</p><p>They stood in Lyle’s kitchen. The county medical examiner had already come and gone, but Lyle’s body hadn’t been removed yet in order to give the “agents” a chance to examine it. He sat on the floor, his back against a cupboard door, a withered husk, parchment-dry skin stretched tight across bone.</p><p>“You don’t have to be a forensics expert to read <em>this</em> crime scene,” Dean said. “Double-Header busted down the back door, slurped up Lyle’s life energy, then took off. I wonder who reported Lyle’s death.”</p><p>“I heard a couple cops talking outside as we walked up. Looks like Lyle was in the process of picking up trash in his back yard when the Double-Header came after him. He never finished—obviously. Later on, the wind kicked up, started blowing trash into his neighbor’s yard—“</p><p>“I get the picture. Neighbor comes over, all pissed off and ready to complain, and finds our boy Lyle prune-ified.”</p><p>“Yep.” Sam hit his coffee once more.</p><p>Dean wondered how much coffee, with added espresso shots, someone could drink before suffering a caffeine overdose. Though Sam didn’t seem to be experiencing any symptoms. So far, all the coffee he’d guzzled hadn’t shifted his system into overdrive. Hell, it had barely kept him awake. Still, he’d have to make sure Sam didn’t make himself sick.</p><p>He had hoped that the smell of Sam’s coffee might help to leaven the stench of the late, unlamented Frankenmutt that clung to them, but if anything, he found the mingled scents even more nauseating. The combined smells didn’t seem to bother Sam, but Dean didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Over the years, Sam had suffered a number of experiences that had altered his behavior one way or another, and it had gotten to the point where Dean wasn’t sure what normal was for his brother anymore. Not that he was one to talk. He’d lost more than a few of his own marbles over the years. He supposed that was one of the reasons the two of them stayed together. Sure, they were family, but they also kept each other going, almost out of habit. If they were this bad now, he wondered what they’d be like when they were old men. Not that there was any guarantee they’d live long enough to reach their golden years. There was a reason why hunters never bothered to save for retirement. All they needed to save for was the cost of a burial. And even that was an iffy proposition, since when they died—assuming they really did die, rather than being turned into a vampire or something—there might not be enough of them left to put in the ground.</p><p>The morbid turn his thoughts had taken—an occupational hazard—inevitably led him to think about Bobby. No condo in Florida for him. At least he and Sam had been able to bury Bobby, first burning his bones so there was no chance he’d come back as a vengeful spirit. He reached into his jacket pocket and touched Bobby’s flask. <em>I miss you,</em> he thought. For a moment, the flask’s metal seemed to warm beneath his fingers, then the sensation was gone, and he dismissed it as his imagination.</p><p>“Both the Double-Header and Frankenmutt drain their victims’ life force,” Dean said. “They might not look anything alike, but they’re basically the same kind of monster.”</p><p>“They’re combinations of different bodies,” Sam pointed out. “So in that sense they do resemble one another.”</p><p>“So we’re definitely looking for a mad scientist type.”</p><p>“Or a mad sorcerer. There’s no way science alone could create monsters like these.”</p><p>“Maybe whoever’s responsible swings both ways,” Dean suggested.</p><p>“So we’re dealing with what? A sorcentist?”</p><p>Dean gave his brother a look. “From now on, leave coming up with the wacky nicknames to me, okay?”</p><p>“Fine.” Sam thought for a moment. “If what we’ve got here is some kind of new fusion of science and magic, it could be something the Leviathan have no defense against.”</p><p>“So we might actually be close to finding Leviathan kryptonite.”</p><p>“Leviathanite?”</p><p>“Dude—seriously.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You’re really quite beautiful, you know. In fact, I’d go so far as to say you’re a masterpiece.”</p><p>Harrison watched Byron take another bite of his—its—their—treat. Each head had two chocolate bars, one for each hand, and they ate in almost perfect unison, raising the candy to their mouths at the same time, biting down, chewing, and swallowing. Harrison had done nothing to connect their brains, so he knew their synchronized movements had no physiological base, which made them all the more fascinating to watch, especially with four hands delivering the chocolate. He was glad to see that the heads had no difficulty swallowing. One of the trickier bits of Byron’s creation had been connecting both heads to a single alimentary canal. It would’ve been impossible without NuFlesh, not to mention the mystical augmentations Harrison had picked up from Conrad. All in all, he was quite pleased. Next time, perhaps he’d try for three heads—a hat trick.</p><p>Byron sat cross-legged on the floor of the shed while he ate, and Harrison stood watching near the door, a stun gun held at his side. Harrison had ordered the weapon online before he began working on Byron, just in case his creation decided to get a bit feisty. The charge the gun delivered wasn’t strong enough to do any serious damage to Byron, but because his mental level was barely above that of an infant, the pain of the electrical jolt was enough to discipline him. Harrison had rarely needed to use the stun gun, though, not when chocolate produced far more effective results. Byron derived no nourishment from food, and it would do nothing to satisfy the hunger that now burned at the core of his being, but it tasted good, and that made it an excellent motivator. Finding Byron and bringing him to the shed had been child’s play. All Harrison had needed to do was wander through the woods behind the Legacy Center, waving an unwrapped chocolate bar in the air and calling out, “I’ve got a treaty for my sweetie!” until Byron came loping toward him, drooling with anticipation. After that, Byron would have followed Harrison to the center of town as long as he received chocolate at the end of the trip. Nevertheless, Harrison still held onto the stun gun. Candy was dandy, but it was no substitute for several million volts of electricity.</p><p>He was a bit worried about his boy—boys. On the way to the shed, he’d had a chance to look Byron over thoroughly, and while his body was predictably dirty and scratched from gallivanting around the woods, Harrison had also noted the first signs of incipient decay. Just a few patches here and there, but it meant that his creation didn’t have much time left. A week, perhaps two at the most. And as the decay grew worse, so would Byron’s hunger, driving him to seek out living creatures and absorb their life energy. Doing so would stave off his decay for a time, but it would only be a temporary stay of execution. Death would inevitably come to him.</p><p>“It’s such a shame. But look at it this way: you’ve managed to escape the Drain, if only for a short time.”</p><p>Neither of Byron’s heads looked at him as he spoke. They were too intent on finishing their treats. They ate with messy delight, smacking chocolate-smeared lips in between bites and humming tonelessly in a way that seemed to Harrison almost like purring.</p><p>He had complied with Conrad’s demand to fetch Byron, but that was as far as he intended to cooperate with the ancient alchemist. Conrad had never told Harrison who he really was, but it had taken no great effort to find out. For pity’s sake, he hadn’t even changed his name! A quick Internet search did the trick. Nevertheless, even given who Dippel was and the terrible knowledge that was his to command, Harrison wasn’t afraid of him. The old man had enjoyed a nice long run, but it was time for someone else to take over. Someone like Harrison. And Byron was going to help him do it. When Conrad returned, Harrison would serve him to Byron for lunch. All he had to do was figure out a way—</p><p>The shed door opened.</p><p>“Hello, Harrison.” Conrad, impeccably dressed as always, stepped inside and Harrison stepped back to make room. His gaze focused on Byron, and while his nose wrinkled in disgust—Harrison had to admit his boys didn’t smell their freshest at the moment—he seemed pleased. “Excellent work.”</p><p>“I pride myself on my customer service,” Harrison said. “It is, after all, at the heart of the funeral industry.”</p><p>He hadn’t expected Conrad to return so soon, and the man’s appearance had taken him by surprise. He took a quick glance around the shed, casting about for anything that he might be able to use for a weapon, but aside from a coiled length of hose, a rusty lawn sprinkler, and an old bag of peat moss, the shed was empty. When Byron had first started sleeping there, Harrison had removed everything that might prove a danger to him. So no sharp garden tools, no hammers, no axes.</p><p>As a businessman, he believed in the value of a carefully thought out plan. It was, after all, one of his primary sales tools. He’d even paid for a billboard out on the highway with a cartoon of a grinning man standing up in a coffin, hands held high above his head with enthusiastic joy, and above him in large letters this slogan: “Preplanning is Fun!” Beneath the coffin in smaller letters: “Put your mind at rest before you’re laid to rest. Brauer Legacy Center.” But as important as having a plan was, sometimes you just had to improvise.</p><p>Harrison turned to Conrad, jammed the stun gun against the side of the man’s neck, and activated the device. There was a loud crackling sound, accompanied by the stink of ozone and scorched flesh. Conrad’s body jerked and shuddered, and Harrison kept the stun gun pressed to his neck, giving him an extra-strong dose of juice. When he figured the man had enough, Harrison pulled the gun away, grabbed hold of his arm, and shoved him toward Byron. Conrad stumbled toward the creature, lost his footing, and fell onto the floor directly in front of him. Alarm crossed both of Byron’s faces, and he began hooting in surprise and fear, sounding like a pair of frightened apes.</p><p>“Drain him!” Harrison shouted. “Suck him dry!”</p><p>Byron’s second head—the one Harrison had added to the original body and which hung at an odd angle—looked at him blankly, but the original head’s eyes narrowed with cunning. That side of the body dropped what was left of its chocolate bars and slapped its hands on Conrad. The second head finally figured out what was happening, and it too dropped its treats and grabbed hold of Conrad.</p><p>Harrison grinned with cruel satisfaction. This was working out even better than he’d hoped. It would all be over within moments, and then he’d be rid of that arrogant prick once and for—</p><p>Conrad, looking a bit disheveled but by no means panicked, reached into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and removed an envelope. He opened it and flung the contents in Byron’s faces. A fine yellow powder spread outward in a small cloud, and both of Byron’s heads inhaled it. The second one sneezed.</p><p>“Stop,” Conrad said.</p><p>Byron stiffened.</p><p>“Release me.”</p><p>Byron removed all four hands from Conrad’s person. Conrad pulled himself to his feet, smoothed out his pants, and adjusted his tie.</p><p>“It was a valiant effort, Harrison, but electricity, against me? Please! I was working with electricity before Benjamin Franklin was a spark in his daddy’s eye.” Without glancing at Byron he said, “Stand,” and Harrison’s creature did. But then, Harrison supposed it wasn’t his creature anymore, was it?</p><p>“How did you put it, Harrison? Oh yes.” Conrad gave the mortician a slow, wicked smile. “‘Drain him. Suck him dry.’”</p><p>Byron started forward, and Harrison knew that he was finally going to find out what death was like. He was surprised to discover he wasn’t looking forward to it as much as he’d anticipated.</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The Winchester brothers traipsed through the woods behind Lyle’s house in search of the Double-Header. Now that they had a better idea what they were up against, they’d come better armed. Dean carried both his Colt and the Winchester 1887 shotgun, and Sam carried his Beretta and the Baikal sawed-off double-barreled shotgun. Both had back-up pistols as well as KA-BAR knives and plenty of extra ammo. In addition, they each carried several flares. Frankenmutt had gone up like a pile of dry kindling, and while they didn’t know if the Double-Header would be as flammable, they figured the flares were extra insurance. <em>Besides,</em> Dean had pointed out, <em>maybe he’ll be afraid of fire, just like in the movies. You know, “Fire bad!”</em></p><p>As they walked, Sam fought like hell to keep from yawning. He didn’t want Dean to worry about him, and he knew his brother was watching him. Despite what he’d told Dean about his weariness being no big deal, Sam was starting to wonder if something more was going on with him than simple exhaustion. No matter what he did, he couldn’t manage to fully wake. Neither sleep nor copious amounts of caffeine seemed to help. He felt slow, not just physically, but mentally, too, like he had molasses running through his veins instead of blood. If they did find the Double-Header, Sam worried that he wouldn’t react fast enough, and he’d end up getting his brother killed. To add to all that, the place where Frankenmutt had bitten him had started to hurt again. The wound throbbed with every step he took, and it was an effort to keep from limping. He hadn’t examined the wound yet—he couldn’t very well do so with his brother around, not without alerting him that something was wrong—but he had the feeling that it wasn’t looking too good.</p><p>He thought about what Dean had said earlier, about how his crazy might have turned inward, which was why he’d been having nightmares about Trish. If that was true, maybe both his weariness and the pain in his leg were additional symptoms of the crazy. The bite on his leg had stopped hurting, and looked like it was healing normally, so why should it suddenly start up again? What if he was having hallucinations, but instead of <em>seeing</em> things this time, he was <em>feeling</em> them?</p><p><em>Forget it,</em> he told himself. <em>One problem at a time. First we gank the Double-Header, then I can worry about my leg.</em></p><p>“I hate hunting new monsters,” Dean said. “Too unpredictable.”</p><p>“On the bright side, a two-headed, four-armed naked guy ought to be easy enough to spot.” Sam said.</p><p>“That’s another thing: couldn’t the mad scientist who made the Double-Header have been considerate enough to at least put a pair of shorts on him? I really don’t want to see his monster dork swinging in the wind when he charges us.”</p><p>They’d considered trying the same technique they used to lure Frankenmutt—using Sam’s phone to simulate a crying baby—but had decided against it. For one thing, the Double-Header had just had a nice big meal of Lyle’s life energy, so there was a good chance he wouldn’t be hungry again for a while. For another, unlike Frankenmutt, the Double-Header was human, or at least he had been, and it was hard to say how intelligent he was. From what Lyle had described, it sounded as if the creature was acting at least partially animalistic—why else would he be digging through Lyle’s trash looking for a snack, and in broad daylight? But he had to retain a certain degree of cunning, at least, and without a driving hunger to goad him into ignoring his instincts, there was a good chance he’d sense that the baby cries were part of a trap. So they’d decided to do things the old-fashioned way: walking through the woods and offering themselves as a pair of meals that the Double-Header, full though he might be, would find too tempting to pass up.</p><p>“He probably has a... a...” Sam struggled to recall the word he was looking for. It was increasingly becoming an effort to think clearly. “...a <em>lair</em> somewhere close by. It gets pretty chilly after dark this time of year, and he’d need somewhere to hole up for the night.”</p><p>Dean frowned at him, and Sam knew his brother had noted his verbal hesitation. “Probably not a cave. This isn’t really cave-y country. I vote for an old barn or maybe an abandoned house.”</p><p>“Sounds good. I say we keep our eyes out for—“</p><p>A branch snapped behind them. The sound wasn’t loud at all, and anyone else might have ignored it, but Sam and Dean’s instincts had been honed to a razor-sharp edge over the years. The two of them whirled around, shotguns raised and ready to fire...</p><p>... only to find themselves looking at a wide-eyed and very surprised rabbit.</p><p>The stare-down lasted only a few seconds before the rabbit turned tail and scurried off, running in a zigzag pattern through underbrush and scattered leaves.</p><p>Dean turned to Sam and grinned. “Why do I suddenly feel like Elmer Fudd?”</p><p>Sam was about to reply when his instincts kicked in again, screaming a warning. He started to turn, but he was too slow, and something struck his chest with pile-driver force. The impact sent him flying backward, and he landed hard, losing his grip on his shotgun in the process. Stunned and feeling as if he’d just gone ten rounds with Godzilla, Sam struggled to sit up. He saw Dean fighting with the Double-Header, the creature no doubt responsible for knocking Sam off his pins. With its top pair of hands the Double-Header had grabbed hold of the barrel of Dean’s shotgun and was pushing it this way and that, preventing Dean from getting a good shot. With the bottom pair, the creature had grabbed Dean under the arms and lifted him into the air as if he was a child. Cussing a blue streak, Dean repeatedly kicked the Double-Header in the gut, and lower, but if the creature felt any pain as a result of the blows, he didn’t show it. One of his heads grinned, the other laughed, and drool ran from the corners of both mouths. As a hunter, Sam had seen some truly disturbing things over the years, but this scene ranked near the top of his personal Most Freakish list.</p><p>Sam knew he should do something, but his head was still reeling from the blow he’d taken, and his chest burned like fire. He figured he had a cracked rib or two at the very least. Normally, he would have been able to push past the pain and disorientation and go to his brother’s aid, but added to the deep weariness that had taken hold of him, it was too much. He couldn’t think straight, and although he wanted nothing more than to get off his ass and go help his brother, he had no idea what he should do.</p><p>The Double-Header started shaking Dean as if he were a shotgun-toting rag doll, and both heads laughed in delight. As Sam watched, shadows appeared on the pair of the creature’s arms that were holding Dean off the ground, the darkness roiling and seething as if alive. The shadows, which looked something like animated black tattoos, slithered down the arms until they were concentrated in the hands pressed to Dean’s sides. Dean let out a cry that was half shout, half moan, and renewed his exertions, desperate to break free of the Double-Header’s grip.</p><p>The Double-Header was draining Dean’s life force. Dean’s energy was waning fast, and within seconds he was moving more slowly, the fight leaving him along with his strength.</p><p>Fighting against his lethargy, Sam moved into a crouching position, drew his Beretta, and fired. His aim was off, and instead of hitting the darker right head dead center at the base of the skull as he planned, the head’s right ear vanished in a spray of red mist and splintered cartilage. Still, the wound had the desired effect. Startled and in pain, the Double-Header released its grip on both Dean and his shotgun, and whirled around to see who had hurt it. Dean crumpled to the ground and lay there, dazed but alive.</p><p>The creature reached up with one of its hands to gingerly touch the ragged bloody ruin where the ear had been. When he removed his hand, the fingers came away slick with blood. He examined them with two pairs of eyes, both heads seeming puzzled, as if they couldn’t quite comprehend what they were looking at. Then it must have hit them, for one head wailed in despair and the other started crying.</p><p><em>They’re like little kids,</em> Sam thought. <em>Toddlers trapped in one huge, monstrous body.</em></p><p>He felt sorry for the Double-Header, and was reminded of the way the Frankenstein monster was sometimes portrayed—as a childlike innocent who had never asked to be reborn as a freakish abomination, and who only wanted to be left alone.</p><p>Both heads looked up at Sam, expressions twisting into masks of hate. Two mouths bellowed in single rage, and the creature charged.</p><p>The time for sympathy was over. Sam squeezed off three more rounds as the Double-Header ran toward him. On any other day, Sam would have put all three into the creature’s heart, but right then it was an effort to hold the gun steady, and his vision was blurry around the edges. The first round only managed to take off the last two fingers on one of the hands. Painful, but hardly a kill shot. The second round struck the left shoulder, but while the impact made the Double-Header stagger for a second, it didn’t slow it down. Better, but still not good enough. The third round was, as the saying goes, the money shot. It hit the right head—which Sam thought of as the main one, since it appeared to be original to the body—and tore away a good chunk of the skull in a spray of red.</p><p>The Double-Header, or maybe it was the One-and-a-Half-Header now, came to a halt only a couple feet away from Sam. It swayed on its feet, the fingers on all four hands twitching spastically. The wounded head lolled on its neck, eyes wide and staring. The second head turned to look at its companion, gaze dull and uncomprehending. The hands on the second head’s side of the body tried to reach up, probably intending to touch the wounded head, just as the creature had explored the ragged ear stump a moment before, but the limbs jerked and spasmed, flailing the air as if the Double-Header was having some kind of seizure.</p><p>Sam thought he knew what was happening. The second, fairer head was wired into the body’s overall nervous system, but the connections weren’t as strong as they could be. The first head was the dominant one, responsible for primary control of the body. Without it, the second head struggled to do the job on its own. Sam kept his Beretta trained on the Double-Header. If he could have trusted his aim, he would’ve put a round into the second head to end the creature’s misery, but as it was, he decided to hold off firing for a few moments. It was possible that the second head would be unable to keep the heart and lungs functioning by itself, and the creature would die soon. If that was the case, all he would have to do was wait for it to collapse, and it would be game over.</p><p>Sam watched the Double-Header lurch and flail, moving like a marionette whose puppeteer was having an epileptic fit.</p><p>He caught more movement out of the corner of his eye, and turned, swiveling the Beretta toward whatever new threat presented itself. He expected it to be another creature, but instead what he saw was a slender man wearing a suit and tie standing near an elm tree. It looked as if he’d been hiding and had stepped out of concealment to get a better look at what was happening. He raised his right hand—Sam saw it had some kind of black mark on the palm—and gestured. Sam wondered if this could be the hazy figure he’d glimpsed several times since arriving in Brennan, finally come into sharper focus.</p><p>He didn’t have time to wonder long. The Double-Header gained a modicum of control over its uncooperative body and took a single lurching step forward. Then it took a second step.</p><p>The surviving head glared at Sam, murder in its eyes, and it stretched all four hands toward him. Writhing black shadows appeared on the creature’s arms, and Sam knew that the Double-Header planned to drain his life force to avenge the death of its companion.</p><p>Sam swung the Beretta back around, aimed at the creature’s heart, and fired.</p><p>He’d aimed too low, and the round entered the Double-Header’s midsection. The impact caused the creature to double over, but it quickly straightened. Blood ran from the wound, but the creature ignored it and continued toward Sam.</p><p>He aimed for the heart again, taking his time, trying not to look at the dark energy swirling around the creature’s hands, trying not to think about how close it was, and how much closer it was getting, but before he could squeeze the trigger, he heard his brother’s voice.</p><p>“Yippee ki-yay, mamasita!”</p><p>A shotgun blast sounded like thunder, and the once Double-Header ended its strange second life as a No-Header. The creature pitched forward and hit the ground like a slab of lifeless meat—which was exactly what it had become. Sam looked up and saw Dean lower his shotgun. He had dark circles under his eyes, and he looked exhausted, but he was alive, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>“Mamasita?” Sam said.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Trying to cut back on the swearing.”</p><p>Sam struggled to his feet. “Admirable, but it lacks a little something in the tough guy department.”</p><p>He remembered the man in the suit, and turned in his direction, ready to fire, but the man was gone.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Dean said. “I saw him, too. Moves pretty fast for an older guy.”</p><p>Sam caught another flicker of movement, this time in the opposite direction. He turned and saw the familiar hazy, shadowy figure that he’d seen before, standing about a hundred yards away. He pointed toward it.</p><p>“How about that one?” he asked.</p><p>Dean looked in the direction he indicated. “Sorry. That one I don’t see.”</p><p>Sam squinted, trying to bring the figure into clearer focus, but it was no use. A second later, it was gone.</p><p>He sighed. At least the guy in the suit hadn’t been a hallucination.</p><p>He tucked his Beretta into the waistband of his pants, retrieved the sawed-off shotgun he’d dropped when the Double-Header had sent him flying, and together he and Dean approached the creature’s corpse.</p><p>Dean kicked it a couple times to make sure it was dead. In their line of work, you never knew if something you put down was going to stay down. The creature didn’t move.</p><p>“I guess it’s officially the Double-Deader now,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam gave him a weak smile. “Okay, that one’s kind of funny.” His smile faded. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I could sleep for a week, but otherwise, I’m all right. I don’t think he managed to siphon too much out of my tank.”</p><p>They turned their attention to the dead monster and rolled it over so they could get a better look at it. Now that they were able to examine the body closely, Sam could see that it had scar lines similar to Frankenmutt’s, only they were confined to where the extra head and arms had been joined to the main body. The Double-Header had been made from fewer pieces than Frankenmutt, and his scar lines were flesh-colored instead of white.</p><p>“NuFlesh?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I think so. But there’s something wrong about these scars.” Sam crouched down and rubbed at the line around the base of one of the extra arms.</p><p>“Careful,” Dean said. “You don’t want to catch Frankencooties.”</p><p>Sam held up his fingers for Dean to see. “Someone covered up his scars with makeup. That’s why they aren’t as obvious as Frankenmutt’s.” He frowned. “He’s got patches of decay on him, too. They’re not very big yet, but they’re definitely present. It looks like he was starting to rot, just like Frankenmutt.”</p><p>“At least he doesn’t smell as bad yet,” Dean said. “Not that he’s a rose or anything right now.”</p><p>Sam wiped his fingers off on the ground before standing.</p><p>“Guess we didn’t need the flares,” Sam said.</p><p>“They still might come in handy,” Dean said. “What do you think the odds are that there are only two patchwork monsters in town?”</p><p>“Not very good,” Sam said.</p><p>“C’mon, let’s gather some wood and torch this son of a bitch. Then see if we can figure out who Mr. Suit-and-Tie is.” He yawned. “After we go back to the hotel and take a nap.”</p><p>Seeing Dean yawn made Sam do the same. “That’s the best idea you’ve had in a long time.”</p><p>The brothers, both moving slow as a pair of zombies, got to work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad moved through the woods far more swiftly and silently than was humanly possible, but that was only to be expected, as he hadn’t been human in three centuries.</p><p>He wasn’t pleased by the creature’s failure to slay the two men. If he hadn’t already killed Harrison, he surely would have done so now. In fact, he was tempted to bring the fool back to life just so he could deprive him of it once again. The encounter had been far from a total loss, however, for he had gained some valuable data.</p><p>He now knew who the two men were. Not their specific identities, those hardly mattered, but he knew what their profession was. They were <em>hunters.</em> Given the nature of the experiments Conrad had conducted over the previous three hundred years—not to mention the results—he had encountered their kind before, and while they’d usually managed to destroy his creations, none of them had ever come close to killing him, and he intended to, in current parlance, keep his streak alive.</p><p>That wasn’t the most important piece of information he’d learned from the failure of Harrison’s two-headed monstrosity, though. Something else had been observing the proceedings, and while to all other eyes this observer would have gone unseen, Conrad’s special status—not dead but technically not alive—allowed him to perceive what others could not. This day a Reaper had been present in the woods. A Reaper!</p><p>During his long existence, Conrad had learned much. He was a master of the ancient art of alchemy—perhaps the only one left in the world—and he was well skilled in the runic magic practiced by the Norse people. He had also picked up a great deal of supernatural lore during his time, and he knew that Reapers were beings who appeared to humans at the moment of their deaths and ushered their souls into the afterlife. They were, in a very real sense, the Death Force personified, and a Reaper, or more accurately, the power it contained, could be the final piece of a puzzle he’d been trying to solve for the last three centuries.</p><p>He needed to return to the bicycle factory and consult his mistress at once. She would know the best way to lure and capture a Reaper. After all, was she not an aspect of Death as well? Of course, if he expected her to grant him such arcane knowledge, he would need a sacrifice of more substance than a mere piglet. He thought of the farmer who had sold him the animal. The man was in his fifties, but he was still healthy, strong, and hardworking. He’d do.</p><p>It looked like he would be making a stop before returning to Kingston Bicycles.</p><p>Conrad didn’t question the Reaper’s presence. He assumed it was following the hunter, the one who’d been bitten by the dog and infected with the creature’s taint. The boy was dying slowly, and the Reaper was like a vulture, circling and waiting for its meal to finish the business of expiring before swooping down to claim it. He hoped the boy would survive for a while yet. The longer he took to die, the longer the Reaper would remain, giving Conrad a better chance to capture it.</p><p>He was more excited than he had been in decades. At last, victory was within his grasp!</p><p><em>Soon, my lady, you shall tread upon the face of the Earth, and all who behold you will marvel at your beauty and wail in despair. It shall be glorious!</em></p><p>He ran faster.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel walked through the woods, trailing the Winchester brothers at a discrete distance. Sam had seen too much of him, and he wanted to make sure to remain out of sight, at least for the time being.</p><p>Daniel’s kind didn’t worry, at least not in the way mortals did, for they had a different perspective on existence. What mortals saw as terrible tragedies were more like skinned knees and bloody noses to Reapers, momentary pains that had no lasting significance in the face of Eternity. Nevertheless, Daniel had to admit to being... concerned.</p><p>He’d been drawn to Brennan because of Conrad Dippel. All beings who defied the natural order and lived beyond their years were violating the ancient pact God and Death made before the birth of the universe. In order for Creation to be a living, growing thing, there had to be Time, and if there was Time, then there had to be a way to mark its passage. For every Before an After, for every Beginning an End, for every Life a Death. Daniel was charged with ensuring this balance was maintained, and he supposed that made him a hunter, too, in a sense. The “undead,” demons, and their ilk usually weren’t so much defying death as continuing to exist in a different way, but a creature like Dippel was a very special, very dangerous case. Even then, it wasn’t Dippel himself that concerned Daniel as much as what he was attempting to do.</p><p>The Winchesters had been of assistance so far, destroying both the monstrous dog and the two-headed man that Dippel’s dark combination of magic and science had wrought (even if technically neither creature had been constructed by his own hand), but the brothers still hadn’t figured out that Dippel’s was the mind behind the patchwork abominations. As long as they were unaware of his identity—or for that matter, that he even existed—how could they do anything to stop him? Dippel might simply pull up stakes and move his operation somewhere else. He could be vengeful and cruel, but ultimately he was a practical man, and if it became too much trouble to continue working in Brennan, Dippel would move on. Daniel would be able to track him wherever he went, of course. The necromantic energy that Dippel gave off was like a blazing beacon to him. But the Winchesters would likely be unable to locate Dippel again, at least not without some serious effort on their part, and right now they didn’t have the time to devote to an extensive search. Daniel knew they had more pressing matters to attend to, namely Dick Roman and the Leviathan. Considering how busy the ravenous monsters had kept the world’s Reapers since their release from Purgatory, Daniel would be relieved when—or maybe that should be <em>if</em>—the Winchesters defeated the beasts.</p><p>As a Reaper, Daniel was forbidden from manifesting in the physical world, but he was permitted to communicate with the living, provided they were close enough to death to perceive him. The very old, those dying from incurable diseases, those who’d had a near-death experience and survived—he could speak to any of them, and try to convince them to act as his agent in the realm of the living. Because Sam Winchester had been infected with a necromantic taint as a result of being bitten by Dippel’s monster hound, he was dying, and Daniel hoped he would be able to communicate with the hunter soon. He would tell him, and by extension, his brother, about Dippel, and lead them to the ancient alchemist. However, it was a plan Daniel might not be able to enact. For all the battering Sam’s mind and spirit had taken, his mental defenses were still far stronger than an ordinary person’s, and his subconscious was shutting the Reaper out, denying his existence, allowing Sam only shadowy glimpses of him. As long as Sam continued to fight like this, Daniel wouldn’t be able to communicate with him. The hunter’s resistance would erode the stronger the dark taint within him became and the closer he drew toward death, but if he became too weak, there was a possibility he might die before Daniel could speak with him. He supposed he would just have to keep following the Winchesters and gamble that Sam lived long enough to help him take out Dippel.</p><p>Dippel himself might be an issue, too. Daniel wasn’t certain, but he thought Dippel might have gotten a glimpse of him while the Winchesters were battling the two-headed creature. Daniel didn’t know if the alchemist possessed the ability to perceive Reapers. He thought it a strong possibility, though, and if that was the case, if Dippel was aware that a Reaper was watching him, who knew what he might do? At the very least, Daniel would have lost the advantage of surprise.</p><p>He sighed. Sometimes working for Death could be a real pain in the ass.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“So, was I right?” Trish whispered. “Isn’t this an <em>awesome</em> place for a haunting?”</p><p>Dean had to admit, the house looked pretty damned spooky, and from the expression on Sam’s face, he knew his brother felt the same. It was located a couple miles from the cabin where Trish lived with her father, not far from a small lake. The latter had served as Trish’s excuse when she told her dad that the three of them wanted to leave the cabin.</p><p><em>I thought we could take a walk by the lake,</em> she’d said, all innocence. <em>Maybe skip some rocks or something.</em></p><p><em>No swimming,</em> her dad had said, eyeing Sam and Dean. They might be younger than Trish, but they were still boys, and it was clear that Walter Hansen didn’t like the idea of them seeing his daughter in a swimsuit.</p><p>Trish had rolled her eyes and given him a look. <em>Da-dee!</em> she’d said, drawing out the word, her voice dripping with embarrassed disapproval. She’d gotten permission, and they’d left, but their real destination had been this house.</p><p>The structure was an old two-story, the wood light gray and mottled with greenish mold and dark areas of rot, the paint long worn away by time and the elements. A section of roof had collapsed, and half of the house sagged, as if the foundation was crumbling beneath it on one side. Dean didn’t know much about architecture—okay, he didn’t know <em>anything</em> about it—but the house looked ancient, like it was built in the 1930s, and maybe even farther back than that. It was narrower than modern houses, the windows smaller, and instead of a porch it had three stone steps leading up to the front door. The steps were cracked, the door hung half off its hinges, and the windows no longer held even shards of glass. Dean was surprised the house hadn’t fallen down by now. It looked like a dilapidated house in a cartoon, the kind that barely holds together and collapses the instant a tiny bird lands on top of it. The land around the house added to its impression of age. Trees had grown up close around it, not as tall as others farther away, but tall enough to indicate how much time had passed since anyone had lived there. There was even a tree growing out of the hole in the roof. The underbrush was thick, and if there had ever been a roadway or path to the house, it was long covered over.</p><p>Yet the aura of spookiness the house exuded wasn’t due to its appearance—at least, not solely. There was a feeling in the atmosphere, a cold tingling that had nothing to do with the early spring air. It made the skin on the back of Dean’s neck crawl, and set his stomach to roiling. He remembered something important his dad had told him once.</p><p><em>You know when a place is bad, son. And I’m talking</em> really <em>bad. You can sense it, same way an animal senses danger. We’re animals, too, deep down, and we still have those instincts within us. All we have to do is listen when they try to warn us. Promise me you’ll always listen, Dean.</em></p><p>Dean had promised, and he listened now. He turned to Trish and kept his voice low as he spoke.</p><p>“Your dad may not be a hunter, but he knows plenty. Why hasn’t he ever told any of them about this place?”</p><p>“He doesn’t believe the stories people tell about this place. The old Herald House.”</p><p>“Harold?” Sam said. “Like the man’s name?”</p><p>Trish shook her head. “Herald as in ‘Hark, the herald angels sing.’ I guess it’s the last name of whoever lived here.” She shrugged. “I don’t really know.”</p><p>“What kind of stories?” Dean asked. He was beginning to fear they were in serious danger of getting in over their heads, <em>way</em> over. When Trish had told them that there was a haunted house not far from her cabin and asked if they wanted to go there and “bust some ghosts,” both Dean and Sam had agreed, trying to act as if it was no big deal, like they were veteran hunters despite their age. That was because they didn’t want to lose face in front of Trish. Dean figured the “haunted house” would turn out to be nothing but a rundown, abandoned building that kids talked about when they wanted to enjoy a shiver or two. He hadn’t expected there to be any <em>real</em> ghosts here. He knew enough about vengeful spirits—and those were the ones that usually stuck around after they died—to know that they were about as far from Casper the Friendly Ghost as it was possible to get. If they were angry enough and could muster sufficient energy, they could affect the physical world. That meant they could kill.</p><p>“A long time ago, the man who lived here killed his whole family,” Trish said. “He didn’t have any reason, at least no reason anyone was ever able to find out. One night he just went crazy, got out of bed, went downstairs, grabbed his hunting rifle, went back upstairs, and ordered his family to get up. He marched them downstairs at gunpoint—his wife, son, and daughter—and then forced them outside into the cold night. He told them he was going to hunt them, but if they could run fast enough and managed to get away, he’d let them live. They cried and begged him not to do this, but he fired his rifle at the ground near their feet to prove he was serious. They screamed and took off running.</p><p>“The man didn’t go after them right away. He wanted to give them a sporting chance. He waited five minutes or so, and then he started after them. He found his little girl first. She hadn’t gone far before climbing into a tree to hide. Most people figure her mother told her to do it because she didn’t think the girl would be able to run fast enough to get away. She was sobbing and begging for her life when her father killed her with a single shot. He found his boy next. He was running from tree to tree, trying to use them as cover. It took the man three shots before he hit his target. His wife had heard the shots and knew her children were dead. She picked up a large rock and approached her husband from behind, intending to kill him for what he’d done. But quiet as she was, he still heard her. Maybe she let out a sob just as she was about to bring the rock down on his head, or maybe she just stepped on a twig. Either way, he spun around and fired his rifle point blank at her. At the exact same moment she smashed the rock into his head. They both died. Not right away, but they were gone before the sun rose. It was almost a week before the wife’s sister got worried because she hadn’t heard from them. She and her husband came out to investigate, but there wasn’t much left of the bodies by then. The animals had picked them clean.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. He thought maybe the story had disturbed his younger brother, but instead of looking upset, Sam looked thoughtful.</p><p>“If the whole family died, then how does anyone know what happened?” he asked.</p><p>Dean hadn’t thought about that. He’d been too caught up in listening to the story. Still, he found himself coming to Trish’s defense, for no other reason than because he wanted her to like him. <em>Really</em> like him.</p><p>“The police probably figured it all out later,” he said.</p><p>Trish gave him a grateful smile, and Dean felt his cheeks flush. Sam scowled with obvious displeasure at his big brother having scored points with Trish.</p><p><em>Too bad you’ll never be as smooth as your big brother, Sammy-boy!</em> Dean thought.</p><p>“So where does the haunting come in?” Sam asked.</p><p>“As the years went by, people began reporting encounters with an armed man out here, and stories began to circulate that the area was haunted. People came out to investigate, and soon they began turning up dead. No one could ever locate the shooter, and eventually folks just stayed away.”</p><p><em>Too bad we aren’t as smart as them,</em> Sam thought.</p><p>“Over the years, the Herald House ghost became a local legend,” Trish continued. “Sometime in the nineteen fifties people nicknamed him the Rifleman after some old TV show, and the name stuck. Hardly anyone ever comes out this way anymore. Every once in a while a hiker or a hunter—a regular hunter, I mean—goes missing. Sometimes the body is found, sometimes it isn’t. When it is—“</p><p>“It’s got a bullet hole in it,” Dean finished.</p><p>“Usually several,” Trish corrected him. “Who knows how many people he’s killed over the years? He’s got to be stopped, and I figured since you guys have been hunting with your dad before, you could help me get rid of him.”</p><p>Dean exchanged glances with his brother. Sam had an annoying tendency to be honest at the most inconvenient times, but he said nothing now. Dean was almost disappointed. Part of him was beginning to think being here was a bad idea, and he would have liked an excuse to leave, even if it made them look like jerks in Trish’s eyes. He could have backed out on his own, he supposed, but he wasn’t the backing-out type. He was the charge-ahead-and-hope-things-didn’t-go-all-to-hell type. Especially when there was a girl involved.</p><p>“You ready?” he asked Sam.</p><p>Sam pulled a gallon-sized plastic storage bag out of his jacket pocket. It was filled with table salt. He nodded.</p><p>Dean held an iron poker he’d borrowed from Trish’s fireplace. Maybe they’d never really gone hunting with their dad, but they’d picked up a few bits and pieces of lore from him. Salt could be used to temporarily disperse a ghost. Iron did the same thing. If you could find a ghost’s bones, you could pour salt on them, set them aflame, and the ghost would be banished to wherever it was ghosts went. Dean had no idea how something so simple as a little salt and fire could do that, but if it worked, it worked, and that was all that mattered to him. He had a container of lighter fluid and some matches in his jacket pocket, so they were good to go. He hoped.</p><p>He turned to Trish. “You should probably stay behind us.”</p><p>She scowled. “Why? Because I’m a girl? I’ve got a bag of salt, too!” She removed the bag from her pocket and shook it in front of Dean’s face for emphasis.</p><p>“No, because you’ve never done this before,” he said. Although the truth was, he had wanted her to stay back because she was a girl. It was what all the tough-guy heroes in the movies did. But he could tell that wasn’t going to fly with her, so he’d go with the other excuse.</p><p>It mollified her somewhat anyway, and she nodded, although she didn’t look happy about it.</p><p>Dean and Sam stepped in front of Trish and began walking toward the Herald House. Dean made sure his younger brother stayed behind him, but as they drew closer to the front door, he couldn’t escape the feeling that he was making a terrible mistake. He was supposed to watch out for Sam. Their dad had drilled that into his head over and over throughout the years, and it had become so deeply ingrained that it went beyond a mere feeling of responsibility. It had become an important cornerstone of Dean’s identity. So what the hell was he doing leading Sam toward a house haunted by a trigger-happy ghost? Was he out of his mind? Neither of them was prepared for this, and impressing a girl—no matter how hot—was not worth putting his brother in danger.</p><p>He stopped walking and turned to face Sam and Trish. “I’m sorry, but I don’t think—“</p><p>There was a loud crash as the front door burst off its remaining hinge and flew through the air, barely missing them. Dean spun around in time to see a man walk out onto the top step. No, not walk. He emerged from the darkness within the house, pulling himself free from the shadows, almost as if they had given birth to him.</p><p>When Trish had first told them about the Rifleman, Dean had imagined the ghost as a cadaverous, chalk-fleshed scarecrow of a creature, with empty dark hollows where his eyes should be, but the man that stood on the front stoop of the Herald House looked almost disappointingly normal. He was of medium height—shorter than Dean, but a bit taller than Sam—and a paunch sagged over the front of his belt. He wore a white button shirt with the sleeves rolled up, black pants with suspenders, and black shoes. His cheeks held a touch of red, he sported a pencil-thin black mustache, and his short black hair was combed and neatly parted in the middle. It looked wet, as if he’d slicked it down with something. His face appeared human enough, all the parts present and arranged in the proper configuration. Of course, his features were contorted into a mask of raw hatred, and he carried a rifle. And there were bloodstains on his shirt... bright red, as if they were still fresh.</p><p>Despite appearances, Dean could sense right away that the figure wasn’t human. Not anymore, anyway. There was the way he’d appeared... the word manifested came to mind, but it was more than that. Dean could feel the wrongness emanating from the Rifleman, rolling off of him like waves of heat rising from coal-black asphalt in July. He was unnatural, plain and simple, his existence an insult to life itself. Dean could almost feel the woods around them drawing back from the apparition, recoiling from the presence of something worse than death.</p><p>The brothers didn’t hesitate. Dean hurled the poker at the same instant Sam flung the contents of his plastic bag. Iron and salt struck the ghost, and the Rifleman’s mouth opened in a silent scream of rage as the substance of his body dissipated into wispy shreds like fog.</p><p>Before he vanished, the ghost managed to get off a single shot, his gun booming loud as cannon fire.</p><p>Dean felt a rush of elation. They’d done it! They might not have banished the ghost for good, but they’d driven it off. Not bad for their first real hunt!</p><p>His excitement left him when he remembered the Rifleman had managed to fire his gun before disappearing. He was all right, but...</p><p>He turned to Sam, who was staring at the now empty doorway, an expression of awe on his face. “Are you okay?” Dean demanded.</p><p>Without taking his eyes off the doorway, Sam nodded.</p><p>Relieved, Dean turned to Trish. “So, what do you think about—“</p><p>He saw her lying on the ground, eyes wide and staring, the front of her sweater soaked with blood.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean sat up in bed. Darkness surrounded him, and for an instant, he didn’t know where he was. He realized he was holding something in his right hand, and it took him a second before he recognized the Colt. He must have grabbed it from under the pillow as he awoke. Damn good thing he hadn’t fired it.</p><p>He sat still for a time, skin slick with sweat, as his pulse and breathing slowly returned to normal. He could hear Sam’s breathing, slow, soft, and steady, coming from the bed next to him. He was glad he hadn’t woken his brother. As wiped out as he’d been lately, he needed all the rest he could get.</p><p>Dean remained there, thinking about Trish Hansen, until the sun rose.</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam opened his eyes, yawned, and stretched. He didn’t feel rested by any means, but he didn’t feel as if he was going to slip back into unconsciousness any second either, and he figured that was an improvement. He sat up and saw Dean sitting at the table, working on the laptop.</p><p>“Maybe we should switch roles. How about you do the research from now on, and I fix cars and chase women?”</p><p>“In your dreams,” Dean muttered. He grimaced then, as if regretting his choice of words. “Coffee’s on your nightstand. It’s probably cold by now.”</p><p>“As long as it’s got caffeine, I don’t care.” Sam picked up the cup and took a sip. “How are you feeling this...” He glanced at the clock on the nightstand. 9:34. “Morning?” he guessed.</p><p>Dean nodded. “I should be asking you that question.”</p><p>“I wasn’t a snack for a two-headed energy vampire yesterday.”</p><p>“I’ve got to admit I’m dragging a little, but I’ll be okay. I figure losing life force is like losing blood. You have to give your body time to build the supply back up.”</p><p>“Yeah. You’re probably right.” Sam had gone to bed in a T-shirt and sweat pants the night before. Both he and Dean had showered before turning in, and he couldn’t smell any traces of Frankenstink in the room. Then again, his senses had been dulled lately, so the room could reek, and he might not know it. They’d stuffed their funkified clothes into a plastic garbage bag, tied it tight, and then stuffed that into another bag and tied that one even tighter. They’d then tossed the clothes into the car’s trunk. When they had time, they’d hit a coin-operated laundry, or maybe just burn the damn things and be done with it.</p><p>Sam moved to the foot of the bed and sat cross-legged while he sipped his tepid coffee. “So what game did you bring back from the darkest jungles of the Internet, oh mighty hunter?”</p><p>Dean gave him a look. “You must be feeling better if you’re cracking jokes that bad. But since you asked...” Dean entered a series of keystrokes, then turned the laptop around so Sam could see the screen. “Look familiar?”</p><p>Sam got off the bed and walked over to the table for a closer look. The image on the screen was an ink drawing of a man. Only his head and shoulders were visible, but from what Sam could see of his outfit, he guessed the man had lived in either the seventeenth or eighteenth century. The longish curled hair—which Sam thought might well be a wig—helped date the image.</p><p>“Actually, he does. That’s the guy we saw after we fought the Double-Header, right?”</p><p>The resemblance was uncanny. Aside from the hair, they could have been looking at a photograph instead of a drawing.</p><p>“You’re looking at Johann Conrad Dippel, a German theologian, physician, and alchemist, born 1673, died 1734.”</p><p>“Sounds like our guy,” Sam said. “What led you to him?”</p><p>Dean smiled. “Check out <em>where</em> he was born.”</p><p>Sam leaned closer and read the text that accompanied the image of Dippel.</p><p>“He was born at Castle <em>Frankenstein?</em> You’ve got to be kidding.”</p><p>“Nope. Turns out Castle Frankenstein’s a real place in Germany. No mad scientists lived there, though. Not unless you count our boy Dippel.” Dean leaned closer to the screen as he skim-read. “According to this, he was fond of dissecting things. He even carried out experiments to try and transfer a soul from one dead body to another. Then he wrote about it in a dissertation called <em>Maladies and Remedies of the Life of the Flesh,</em> in which he also claimed to have discovered the Elixir of Life. Eventually he set up a lab somewhere in west Germany. A local minister accused him of grave robbing, experimenting on corpses, and—naturally—consorting with the Devil. It doesn’t say if he was ever run out of town by pitchfork-wielding villagers, but it does say his ‘controversial theories’ got him banned from countries like Sweden and Russia. Historical records get patchy after that, but shortly before he died—or at least was <em>presumed</em> dead—he announced he’d discovered a potion that would make him immortal. That’s it. I’d say that makes him Suspect Number One, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Hell, yeah. So, what, Mary Shelley heard about Dippel and used him as inspiration for her novel?”</p><p>“That’s what the Interweb says, although it also says there’s no definite proof. But given what we’ve seen—not to mention smelled—over the last couple days, I’d say it’s a good bet.”</p><p>“So I guess, in a way, we really <em>are</em> looking for Dr. Frankenstein.”</p><p>“Pretty cool, right?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sam sipped more coffee as he mulled over the information Dean had related to him. “Any idea why an immortal German alchemist is creating monsters in modern-day Ohio?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “The cost of living is cheaper here?”</p><p>“Probably easier to keep a low profile in a small town. That way if one of your experiments breaks loose, it’s less likely to be noticed.”</p><p>“It would be kind of hard for something like Frankenmutt or the Double-Header to stroll down a street in New York without raising a few eyebrows.”</p><p>Besides, it fit a pattern Sam and Dean had become very familiar with over the years. While large cities had their share of supernatural entities, for the most part monsters and malicious spirits tended to inhabit out-of-the-way places so they could keep a low profile while hunting their prey. The Leviathan were, of course, a notable exception to this modus operandi. Given their shape-shifting abilities, they preferred to hide in plain sight.</p><p>“I don’t suppose the ‘Interweb’ said anything about how to kill an immortal alchemist,” Sam said.</p><p>“Not a word. But I figure we can try any of the standard ganking techniques, with decapitation being at the top of the list.”</p><p>“Fire might be good, too. Both Frankenmutt and the Double-Header caught fire easily enough and burned fast. Whatever Dippel did to their bodies to bring them back to life, it made them extra flammable. It stands to reason that he used a similar process to extend his own life—the same chemicals and mystic rites—and if so...”</p><p>“He’ll burn as easy as dry grass,” Dean finished.</p><p>“Let’s hope so. Now all we have to do is figure out how to find him.”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “What a name, huh? <em>Dippel.</em> Not as cool or scary as Frankenstein. Kind of dorky, actually. What are the chances the man has changed it after three hundred years?”</p><p>“You’ve seen the Frankenstein movies,” Sam said. “No matter which actor plays the doctor, what’s the one thing that always stays the same about him?”</p><p>Dean answered right away. “Ego. Frankenstein always thinks he can play God.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “A guy like that, I’m betting he’d never change his name. He’s too proud.”</p><p>“Makes sense. So, about finding him. I have an idea. Every Dr. Frankenstein needs an Igor, right? An assistant to help him carry out his unnatural experiments. I think we may have already met Dippel’s Igor.”</p><p>“Dr. Martinez,” Sam said.</p><p>“Mr. NuFlesh himself. Looks like Dippel’s decided to blend a little twenty-first-century know-how with his sixteenth-century alchemy.”</p><p>“Two great tastes that taste great together,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean raised his eyebrows. “That one wasn’t bad, Sammy. Almost made me crack a smile.”</p><p>Sam finished the last of his cold coffee. He was already starting to feel tired again. He fought back a yawn.</p><p>“Let me hit the bathroom and get ready real quick, and then we can head over to—“</p><p>The motel room spun crazily around him. The next thing he knew he was lying on his back looking up at the ceiling. Dean was patting his cheek, and not gently, either.</p><p>Sam pushed his hand away. “How long this time?”</p><p>“Too friggin’ long,” Dean growled. “I took a look at your leg while you were out. That bite wound’s not looking too good—and that’s an understatement.”</p><p>Sam glanced down the length of his body and saw that Dean had rolled up the leg of his sweat pants all the way to his knee. The skin where Frankenmutt had bit him had turned black, and dozens of ebon threads had spread out from the wound, covering that side of his leg from knee to ankle.</p><p>“You had to have seen this when you took a shower last night,” Dean said, accusation in his voice. “Unless you’re a prude who showers with his eyes closed because you’re embarrassed to see yourself naked.”</p><p>Sam struggled to sit up, and almost fell back again. He would have, too, if Dean hadn’t reached out to steady him.</p><p>“Yeah. It’s worse today, though.”</p><p>“Why the hell didn’t you say anything? I know your brains are thoroughly scrambled right now, but I refuse to believe you’ve become that stupid!”</p><p>Sam couldn’t help smiling. “For a second there, you sounded like Bobby.”</p><p>“Don’t change the subject. We’ve got to do something about this infection, or whatever the hell it is, before it—“</p><p>“Kills me?” Sam finished.</p><p>“Or turns you into something like Dippel.”</p><p>“What <em>can</em> we do? I was bitten by a monster dog created by an undead alchemist. Big Pharma doesn’t make a pill for that. Whatever this infection is, it’s at least partially magical in nature, so science alone isn’t going to cure it. If Cass was here, he could wave his hand and make me all better, but he’s not, so we’re just going to have to keep charging ahead and see what happens.”</p><p>“What <em>happens?</em> Take a real good look at your leg. I can tell you what’s going to happen—that black crap’s going to continue spreading until it covers your whole goddamned leg. And after that... well, whatever happens after that, I guarantee you neither of us is going to like it.”</p><p>“You’re just lucky the Double-Header used his hands to drain your battery,” Sam said. “If he’d bitten you, we might both be in trouble.”</p><p>“Look, forget Dippel for now. We’ll take care of him after we get you fixed up. There’s got to be something in the lore about how to counteract this. All we have to do is find it.”</p><p>“There’s only one man who understands what’s happening to me, and that’s Dippel. Once we find him, maybe he can tell us what to do to counteract the infection, and if he won’t cooperate, maybe he’ll have some notes or journals we can look through. Maybe he’s even upgraded to a computer by now.”</p><p>“Oh, he’ll cooperate all right,” Dean said. “I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>His face was stone, his tone like ice, and Sam knew he was remembering the time he’d spent in Hell learning the secrets of torturing the damned. Dean rarely spoke of that time, and when he did, he never went into any real detail, but Sam knew his brother recalled every horrific moment he’d spent in Hell, and that included everything he’d learned there.</p><p>Sam almost felt sorry for Dippel.</p><p>He decided now wasn’t a good time to tell his brother about the other effect the... death infection, for lack of a better term, was having on him. During the battle with the Double-Header, Sam had seen shadow energy swirling around the monster’s arms as it attempted to drain Dean’s life force, but Dean hadn’t mentioned seeing that. He hadn’t seen the shadowy figure either, though he <em>had</em> seen Dippel watching them. Sam had initially thought they were hallucinations, but he’d since come to a different conclusion. He had Frankenmutt’s taint inside him now, and it had altered his perception, giving him a kind of death vision, allowing him to perceive the dark energy the Double-Header had summoned. Sam now thought the shadow figure was real, but Dean couldn’t see it. Only he could. He didn’t know what the figure was. Maybe nothing more than a local ghost drawn by the death energy released by Dippel’s creations like a moth to a flame. He supposed it was one more thing they’d have to figure out as they went.</p><p>He was afraid Dean would dismiss his death vision as another symptom of his “scrambled brains,” or worse, he’d see it as a sign the infection was more advanced than he feared. Better to keep it to himself for now, Sam decided, although he knew Dean would be pissed when the truth eventually came out. He usually was.</p><p>Dean took hold of Sam’s arm and helped him to stand.</p><p>“Does it hurt to put any weight on it?” he asked.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Actually, it’s mostly just numb.”</p><p>“That’s not as comforting as you think it sounds. All right, you hit the john—or maybe I should say the Johann—and then we’ll go see what we can shake loose from the Phantom of the Strip Mall.”</p><p>Sam was about to chide his brother for making light of Dr. Martinez’s appearance, when his sense of smell, dulled these last couple days, suddenly kicked in. He sniffed the air and frowned.</p><p>“Do you smell smoke?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad stood in the parking lot of the Wickline Inn, no more than a dozen feet from the hunters’ door. Thanks to the gift from his lady, he had no trouble tracking them. This close, the rune engraved in his palm burned with a cold so intense it was almost unbearable. But bear it he would, for it was a boon granted to him by his dark mistress, and thus the agony was not a burden, but an honor.</p><p>He could have gone after the hunters at any time, but his long years had taught him not only the value of patience, but also of planning. So after the pair had slain Harrison’s two-headed beast, Conrad had returned to the bicycle company—a far cry from the castle where he’d been born, but serviceable enough—and proceeded to think.</p><p>He’d spent the better part of the night developing and discarding one plan after another for ridding himself of the hunters. Some plans were too complex and presented numerous possibilities for failure, others left too much to chance, while still others would draw too much attention, and that he wished to avoid at all costs. He was the closest he’d been to achieving his goal in three centuries, and he didn’t want to abandon the town, and Catherine, unless he had no other choice. In the end, as the first rays of dawn pinked the horizon, he finally decided. The plan was a simple one—which was why it had taken so long to occur to him, he supposed—but there was an elegance to it as well, along with an irony that he found as delicious as he did irresistible.</p><p>In alchemy, everything came down to the four basic elements from which all creation sprang: Earth, Air, Water...</p><p>And Fire.</p><p>He withdrew a glass vial from his jacket pocket and pried out the wax stopper. Inside was the mummified body of a tiny lizard-like creature. He’d been saving the little fellow for a special occasion, and it seemed that it had finally arrived.</p><p>He shook it out gently onto his left hand, the one unmarked by his lady. He held it up to his mouth and gently breathed on it. Instantly, its parchment-dry skin became a bright crimson, the flesh swelling with liquid, becoming soft and moist. It stirred in his palm, tiny ebon eyes blinking in the morning light.</p><p>Conrad raised the creature close to his lips once more and whispered a single word.</p><p>“Hunters.”</p><p>The salamander’s body temperature began to rise, and by the time Conrad crossed the distance to the motel room door, its heat had become almost as painful as the cold blazing from the rune on his other hand. He knelt, lowered his hand, and gently deposited the creature onto the ground. It scuttled forward and pressed its nose against the surface of the door. Conrad could feel waves of heat rolling off its body as if it were a blast furnace instead of a tiny lizard. A second later, the wood at the base of the door where the salamander’s snout touched it began to blacken and smolder, and the creature pushed itself forward, burning a tunnel as it went.</p><p>If all went as he planned, Conrad would leave with more than the satisfaction of knowing the two hunters were dead, sweet as that would be, he would have obtained the last element necessary to fulfill the promise he’d made to his dark mistress so many long years before. All he needed to do was wait and for the Reaper to make an appearance. If a couple deaths didn’t bring one of his kind out of the woodwork, what would?</p><p>Feeling more cheerful than he had in decades, Conrad whistled an old German drinking song as he withdrew to a safe distance to watch the fun.</p><p>* * *</p><p>At first Dean thought maybe Sam was beginning to hallucinate smells on top of everything else, but then he smelled it, too—and it was getting stronger. It smelled different than regular smoke, with a chemical tang that made Dean think of a combination of gasoline and sulfur. He looked around for the source, but it was Sam who spotted it first.</p><p>“Look!” Sam pointed toward the door.</p><p>Dean turned and saw a widening scorch mark at its base, wisps of smoke rising from it as if the wood was being burned from the inside.</p><p><em>What the hell?</em></p><p>As the brothers watched, scorched wood flaked away to black ash and something pushed its way into the room. At first it was covered in soot, but crimson flames flared bright, burning the black stuff into nothing, revealing the body of a small red lizard no longer than one of Dean’s pinkies. The lizard came further into the room, leaving a trail of tiny blackened footprints in the carpet.</p><p>“What’s that?” Dean asked. “A fun-sized dragon?”</p><p>“I think it’s a salamander,” Sam said, a worried tone in his voice. “And not the kind you find next to a pond. It’s a mythological creature that—“</p><p>Crimson fire burst outward from the salamander in all directions, and it scuttled toward the brothers, coming at them like a mobile campfire.</p><p>“Does that,” Sam finished.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel had been keeping an eye on the Winchesters since they’d fought the two-headed monster in the woods the day before. He’d even tried communicating with Sam that night after the brothers had showered and collapsed into bed. Given the right circumstances, Reapers could make contact with humans while they slept. The sleep state was in certain ways akin to death anyway—one of the reasons some sorcerers and psychically gifted humans were able to travel astrally while sleeping—and since Sam was already infected with the dark taint which was spreading and growing stronger with each passing hour, Daniel thought there was a good chance he might be able to contact him, or at least plant a suggestion into his subconscious. But he’d had no luck. Sam had been too weary, his slumber too deep. So Daniel had withdrawn from their room, passing silently through the door—physical barriers meant nothing to his kind—and taken up a position next to their vehicle, where he remained throughout the night. His kind did not tire, and they possessed almost limitless patience. It was a trait they shared with their master.</p><p>That morning, Daniel had sensed Dippel’s approach long before the alchemist appeared, and since he was still uncertain whether or not the man could perceive him, he retreated to the room next to the Winchesters’. He was relieved to find it empty.</p><p>He didn’t have senses, not in the way humans understood them, so he didn’t smell the wood burning, but he could detect Sam and Dean’s muffled voices, and their tone of alarm was unmistakable. Given the fact that this coincided with Dippel’s arrival, Daniel didn’t need to be a genius to know that something was wrong.</p><p>He hesitated less than a second before stepping through the wall between rooms. He emerged into the Winchesters’ just in time to hear Sam speak the word “salamander.” Daniel knew how dangerous salamanders like this—supernatural creatures of an age gone by—could be. He moved toward the creature, hoping that he would be able to reach it before...</p><p>Flames burst forth from the salamander’s tiny form, crimson, hot, and terrible to behold. Daniel knew the mystical fire could burn through anything, and nothing could extinguish it, not even a lack of oxygen. It would continue to spread, devouring everything in its path until the magic that fueled it was expended, and no power on Earth—and few powers beyond—could force it to do otherwise.</p><p>Daniel could do nothing about the flames that the creature had already kindled, but he could ensure that it generated no more. He moved past Sam and Dean, the former gasping as he saw Daniel go by, and crouched in front of the salamander. He reached through the corona of flames surrounding it—the fire feeling hot even to his fleshless substance—and touched his index finger to the lizard’s head.</p><p>A Reaper’s task was vital in a cosmic sense, but ultimately a simple one: to be present at the moment of a human’s death and serve as escort to, and if necessary, advisor about, the afterlife. Death’s servants had many supernatural abilities to help them perform their duties, and one of the simplest was also one of the most powerful: when they wished it, their touch could kill.</p><p>Despite its diminutive size, the salamander was a creature endowed with powerful magic, and it fought the Reaper’s influence, but in the end, no matter how hard the struggle, all must bow before Death. The salamander shuddered once, curled into a ball, and grew still. Its magic fled with its death, and since it was no longer protected against its own flame, it was instantly cremated.</p><p>With the salamander destroyed, there would be no new flames, but those that had already been released were spreading rapidly. Daniel knew he’d only managed to buy the Winchesters some time.</p><p>Without turning to gauge Sam’s reaction to what he had done, Daniel stepped toward the burning door and passed through it. No longer would he hide from Dippel. It was high time he did something about the alchemist. He didn’t know the full extent of the man’s dark powers, but in the end he would surely prove no match for one of Death’s chosen.</p><p>“Greetings, my friend.”</p><p>Dippel stood outside the door, as if he had been waiting for Daniel. The alchemist held a polished dark blue stone in his hand, and with a cold smile he thrust it toward Daniel. The two were so close that Dippel’s hand entered Daniel’s chest, burying the stone deep within his ethereal substance. Daniel had never known pain. If he had, he would have known that this wasn’t a pain of the flesh, a simple series of signals transmitted along a network of nerves, this was a pain of the soul, and it washed away Daniel’s very self and swept him into darkness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad held the Lapis Occultus up to his face and peered into its dark blue depths. He couldn’t see the Reaper’s spirit, of course, but he could sense its power pulsing within, and he felt a swell of triumph. He heard a woman’s voice whisper through his mind, cold as an arctic blast. <em>You have done well, my servant. Now complete the task you embarked upon so long ago.</em></p><p>Conrad was disappointed. He would rather have remained to watch the hunters burn in the salamander’s unquenchable flames. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had the opportunity to use one of the incendiary lizards, and he’d really been looking forward to enjoying the resulting holocaust. Still, one had to tend to business before pleasure. Especially when said business was done in the name of a goddess of death.</p><p>He inclined his head. “Thy will be done, my lady.”</p><p>He tucked the Lapis Occultus—which idiot scholars had long mistakenly referred to as the Philosopher’s Stone—into his jacket pocket and headed for his car. The Lapis Occultus possessed many useful properties: turning base metals into gold, healing illness, and prolonging life. And with the right adjustments, it also made an extremely effective prison for a Reaper.</p><p>Conrad had one stop to make before presenting the Reaper’s spirit to Catherine. He needed to acquire more NuFlesh, and he owed Peter Martinez the unguent he’d promised him. Conrad Dippel was many things, almost all of them unpleasant, but a breaker of vows was not among them.</p><p>Beautiful clouds of crimson-tinged smoke billowed into the sky as he got into his car and pulled out of the motel’s parking lot. He was concerned that Martinez might be tempted to over-apply the unguent once he got hold of a fresh supply. If so, the results would be... unfortunate. Still, what did it matter? After today, Conrad would have no more need of Martinez or his NuFlesh. Soon his mistress would be free to walk the Earth, and devastation and despair would follow in her wake.</p><p>It was going to be glorious.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam didn’t know if it was his proximity to the shadow figure or the worsening of his condition, but he was able to make out some details of the being’s appearance this time. Not much, just a suggestion of body shape and facial features, enough to make him think the figure was a shadow <em>man.</em> He watched it step toward the salamander, crouch down, touch it, and then straighten and walk through the blazing door as if it and the fire that was rapidly devouring it wasn’t there. Sam wasn’t certain what the shadow man had done to the salamander, but as near as he could tell it was dead, burnt to a crisp by its own flame. The fires it had already produced continued to rage unabated, however.</p><p>The room’s smoke alarm began shrilling a high-pitched warning that was as annoying as it was unnecessary.</p><p>The door was aflame, as were the curtains around the window and the legs of the table. Sam lunged forward—nearly losing his footing thanks to his numb leg—and snatched up the laptop before the fire could claim it. Although he didn’t come in contact with any of the flames, the heat that emanated from them was intense, and his skin stung as if he’d received an instant sunburn. He stepped back, closed the laptop, and tucked it under his arm. He’d been just in time. The blazing curtains fell onto the tabletop, igniting it.</p><p>“Let’s try for the window,” Dean said. “If we break it, we can jump through. We might get a little singed in the process—“</p><p>“No good,” Sam said, shaking his head. “This is magic fire. If even a single small flame touches us, the fire will spread across our bodies until we’ve been reduced to ash!”</p><p>Sam felt as if his brain was running at near-normal speed again. Amazing how the threat of immediate incineration focused one’s concentration.</p><p>The room was rapidly filling with acrid smoke. The air had an oily texture, and breathing it in was like inhaling ground glass. Sam thought it would be a race to see which would kill them first: the flames or the poisonous smoke.</p><p>“Get your gun.” Dean ordered.</p><p>Sam didn’t question his brother. His gun was still underneath his pillow, while Dean’s rested on the nightstand next to his bed.</p><p>Gun in hand, safety off, Sam said, “Now what?”</p><p>“Motel walls are notoriously thin, right? We concentrate our fire on one spot and shoot our way through to the next room.”</p><p>“But what if someone’s—“</p><p>Dean shouted, “Look out!” and fired a round high into the wall, so if it went all the way through, the odds of it hitting anyone on the other side were small. He waited a moment, then said, “That ought to do it.” He began firing at the center of the wall between the two beds, and Sam joined him.</p><p>The Winchesters were practiced marksmen, and more importantly, they had a great deal of experience shooting under adverse conditions—like when some monster or other was trying to rip their faces off. Their aim was steady and true, and plaster flew out of the wall in large chunks. They both emptied their clips, but while they’d chewed away a good-sized hole, could even see into the next room, it wasn’t large enough to crawl through. Ammo spent, both brothers reflexively tucked their pistols into their waistbands. The gun metal was hot, but it was nothing compared to the flames at their back.</p><p>Sam could feel the flames, almost as if he was lying on a frying pan with the heat turned to high. He could almost feel his flesh back there starting to blister. He figured they had seconds left, if that, before the salamander’s fire engulfed them.</p><p>Dean rapidly cast his gaze around the room. If anyone else had been present to witness him do this, they might have thought it a sign of panic, but Sam knew his brother’s mind was working at warp speed, trying to come up with a way out. Dean usually put up a front, acting as if he was a regular everyday Joe whose most intellectual pursuit was watching foreign porn movies on pay-per-view. In reality he was highly intelligent, and a master of strategy and tactics. If anyone could find a way to escape this death trap, he could.</p><p>“Hit it!” Dean shouted.</p><p>Before Sam could ask what he meant, Dean ran toward the hole they’d shot in the wall and threw himself at it, shoulder first. He thudded against the wall in a shower of plaster and white dust, grunted, then stepped back to try again. Sam joined him this time, and after two more blows, the wall crumbled under the impact, and the two of them tumbled into the room next door.</p><p>Sam moaned. His shoulder screamed with pain, and he thought he might have dislocated it. At least he wasn’t burning to death. He gave the laptop a quick glance. He’d done his best to shield it with his body as they broke through the wall, and as near as he could tell, it had survived the trip intact. The two of them, however, were covered with plaster dust and bits of wall insulation.</p><p>He looked at Dean. “Hit it? That was your big plan? What if there’d been a support beam in the way?”</p><p>“It worked, didn’t it?”</p><p>Luckily, the room was empty. For an instant, as they broke through, Sam had feared they’d find someone there, lying on the ground, bleeding from a dozen bullet wounds.</p><p>Dean got to his feet, reached down, and helped Sam to his. Sam cradled his right arm to his chest to guard the shoulder, and looked back at the hole. The fire had spread to the rest of their room, and was already coming their way. A cloud of harsh-smelling smoke billowed through the hole, setting off the smoke alarm in the room, and Sam knew if they didn’t get out of there fast, they’d be charbroiled.</p><p>They headed for the door, opened it, and plunged into the parking lot and the blessedly smoke-free air.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean wanted to head straight for their car, hop in, and go gunning for Dippel, but Sam dissuaded him.</p><p>“We have to help get everyone to safety,” he insisted.</p><p><em>Sometimes being good guys really sucks,</em> Dean thought, but he knew Sam was right, and they spent the next fifteen minutes running around, pounding on room doors and shouting “Fire!”</p><p>They found less than a dozen people, including cleaning staff. As it was close to ten a.m., most of the Wickline Inn’s patrons had already checked out or left for the day on whatever business had brought them to Brennan. By the time a fire truck and EMT van arrived, Dean was confident that they’d managed to get everyone out of the motel and a safe distance away from the blazing structure. He and Sam watched the firefighters do what they could to put out the flames, but mere water had no effect on salamander-fire, and within a short time, the motel was nothing but a blackened, smoking ruin. One good thing: when the motel was gone, so was the fire. As Sam had predicted, once their power was spent, the flames burned themselves out. It seemed that whoever—or whatever—had created salamanders had been smart enough to realize that a creature that generated unstoppable devastating flame needed some kind of off switch. Lucky for them.</p><p>When they were certain the firefighters and emergency medical personnel had everything under control, Sam and Dean headed for the car, got in, and pulled out of the parking lot. One good thing about the place being destroyed: at least they didn’t have to settle the bill.</p><p>“I’m glad you managed to save the computer, but we lost all the other stuff we had in the room, including our extra clothes. All we got left is what we got on, which smells like smoke, and the crap we bagged up in the trunk, which smells like Frankenrot. I guess no matter what we do, we’re going to end up stinking until we can find time to hit a department store.”</p><p>“I’d rather stink than be stuck in a burn ward,” Sam said.</p><p>“No kidding.” A thought occurred to Dean. “What happened to the salamander? It looked like it died right after it burned its way into our room. Are they supposed to do that?”</p><p>Sam didn’t reply right away, and Dean wondered if his brother had slipped into another one of his mini-comas again. But when he glanced over at him, he saw his eyes were open.</p><p>“There’s something I haven’t told you.”</p><p>Dean’s stomach dropped. He hated it when Sam did this to him. Both of them had a tendency to play things close to the vest at times, but Sam was the proverbial still waters that ran deep. When he finally felt compelled to confess something, it was usually because whatever it was had gotten so bad he could no longer keep it a secret. Dean steeled himself for whatever Sam was going to say next.</p><p>“I have death vision.”</p><p>Dean stared at his brother for a long moment.</p><p>“Say what?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the way to NuFlesh Biotech, Dean pulled into a coffee shop drive-thru and Sam ordered a large coffee with five shots of espresso. Then he changed his mind and got seven shots instead. Dean ordered a large pumpkin-flavored drink with whipped cream on top. When Sam raised an eyebrow at his brother’s choice of beverage, he said, “What? They only have pumpkin in the fall.” As far as Sam was concerned, Dean might as well have gotten a milkshake, but to each his own. Besides, he wasn’t one to be lecturing anyone about making healthy choices. His caffeine intake was verging on insane, and it still barely kept him functioning.</p><p>Dean had taken his revelation about possessing “death vision” fairly well, all things considered. Probably because he was planning to force Dippel to tell them how to cure the infection spreading through Sam’s body. Dean always felt better when he had a clear course of action to follow. But even though Sam had been the one to bring up the possibility in the first place, he wasn’t confident that Dippel would know of a cure, or if he did, that he’d share it with them. As old and powerful as Dippel was, they’d be lucky to kill him, and there likely wouldn’t be any time for questioning beforehand. There was a good chance this would be Sam’s last hunt, and while he had faced death on numerous occasions—even experienced it a few times—he knew this time it would stick. There was no Cass to heal him at the last minute with angelic powers, no mystic artifact, spell, or potion in their possession that could counteract the death-infection. Even if they had such an item, Sam wasn’t sure he’d want to use it. Magic that powerful came at a high cost, and it often had unexpected—and tragic—side effects. Like with Trish.</p><p><em>Sometimes death is better,</em> Sam thought. <em>A lot better.</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>The brothers shared a guest room in the Hansen cabin, just down the hall from Trish’s room, but neither of them got any sleep that night. Before, when they’d had trouble sleeping, it was because of Trish’s proximity. It was hard not to imagine her lying on her bed snuggled beneath the covers, and even harder not to wonder what she slept in, or if she slept in anything at all. But she wasn’t in her room that night, and she never would be again. Each of the boys had his own twin bed, and Sam lay on his, staring through the darkness up at the ceiling, or at least in the direction where the ceiling was. Heavy curtains blocked all light from coming through the window, rendering the room as black as the inside of a cave. Sam wondered if this was what it was like for Trish right now, surrounded by darkness and silence. Only in her case, morning would never come.</p><p>It wasn’t totally silent in their room, though. He could hear Dean breathing, and he knew from the volume and rhythm of the sound that his brother was awake. He had a pretty good idea what he was thinking, too. As the older brother, he viewed it as his responsibility to take care of Sam, and by extension, of anyone around him. He’d seen himself as the leader of their ill-fated expedition to the Herald House, and therefore responsible for how it had turned out. That meant he blamed himself for Trish’s death. Sam felt that he was equally responsible. After all, both of them had pretended that they’d gone hunting before, that they’d encountered ghosts and knew how to handle them. True, Sam had mostly kept his mouth shut while Dean lied, but he hadn’t contradicted his brother, and as far as he was concerned, that amounted to the same as lying. Some hunters they turned out to be. All they’d managed to do was dispel the ghost for a time, to wound it temporarily and make it retreat to wherever it was ghosts went when they weren’t manifesting on the material plane. It would be back, as deadly as ever.</p><p>Sam wanted to say something to make his brother feel better, or at least let him know that he didn’t blame him for what had happened, but he was afraid that anything he might say would be stupid and end up making Dean feel worse. So he lay in the dark and said nothing.</p><p>They’d carried Trish’s body back to the cabin, Dean holding her beneath the arms, Sam gripping her legs. It was the first time either of them had touched her, but Sam took no pleasure in it, and he knew Dean didn’t either. Trish was lighter than he’d expected, almost as if some part of her had departed when she died, leaving behind only an empty shell. Her father had been sitting at the kitchen table when they arrived, waiting for them, as if he’d sensed that something had happened. Something bad.</p><p>Sam and Dean carried Trish inside and laid her gently on the couch. When Walter Hansen saw his daughter’s body, the front of her sweater tacky with drying blood, he stood and stared at her for nearly five minutes without speaking. Several times Dean tried to say something, but each time Walter held up his hand to forestall him. Then without a word or even so much as a glance at either of them, he picked up his daughter, carried her out of the living room, into the kitchen, and then down into the basement. Sam and Dean trailed behind, unsure what to do. They stood in the kitchen, not daring to violate the sanctity of Walter’s workspace, which they’d never been invited into, and waited. A couple moments later, they heard the sound of Walter’s boots on the stairs. Sam had thought that this was it. Walter was going to come bursting through the door, yelling at them for having gotten his daughter killed. Then he heard the lock on the basement door engage, and a second later, Walter went back down the stairs.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, they sat at the table and remained there until long after the sun went down. They didn’t speak, didn’t eat or drink. They didn’t do anything but sit and stare at the closed and locked basement door. Eventually, Dean stood up and headed down the hall to their bedroom, and Sam followed. They crawled into bed without brushing their teeth or anything, and they’d been lying there ever since, awake and silent.</p><p>In his mind, Sam saw the Rifleman’s horrible expression as he emerged from the darkness within Herald House, watched him raise his rifle, heard the thunderous sound of his weapon discharging. Replaying it once, twice, three times...</p><p>The next thing Sam was aware of was the smell of bacon frying, and he realized he must have fallen asleep. Some people drifted off while counting sheep, but he’d zonked out counting gunshots. If that didn’t make him a prime candidate for the funny farm, he didn’t know what did.</p><p>The room was still dark, thanks to the curtains, but he had the sense that Dean was sitting up on his bed.</p><p>“You smell that?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” It was freaking him out, too. In the entire time they’d been staying with the Hansens, Walter had never made breakfast. Trish always had. Sometimes pancakes, sometimes French toast, sometimes eggs, but no matter what she made, she always fried bacon to go with it. Always.</p><p>“What should we do?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Check it out,” Dean answered, although he didn’t sound confident about his answer.</p><p>Sam didn’t blame him. The skin on the back of his neck was crawling, and he could feel a cold heaviness in his belly, as if he’d swallowed a hunk of lead.</p><p>Dean stood up and walked to the door, feeling his way through the dark. When he reached the door, he found the light switch and flipped it on. The overhead light came to life, and Sam squinted against its glare. He wanted to stay right where he was, but Dean was being brave, and that meant he should be brave, too—even if he didn’t want to. He climbed out of bed and joined Dean at the door. They’d both gone to bed in their clothes, so they didn’t need to change. Too bad. Sam would have appreciated any delay, no matter how small.</p><p>Both boys ran their fingers through their hair in an attempt too make it look at least a bit less mussed, and then Dean opened the door and they stepped into the hall. The smell of bacon was stronger here, and despite the situation, Sam found his mouth starting to water, and his stomach gurgled. He felt immediately ashamed. How could he be hungry after everything that had happened? But he couldn’t help it. Then Dean’s stomach rumbled, making Sam feel a bit better.</p><p>They walked down the hall into the kitchen. Walter sat at the kitchen table, sipping a mug of coffee, an empty plate before him. He looked up when they entered, and he smiled.</p><p>“Good morning, boys! Pull up a seat!”</p><p>He sounded cheerful, but his face was haggard and drawn. The flesh beneath his eyes was puffy and dark, and the lower half of his face was dotted with stubble. He didn’t smell too good, either, and he was wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday. Sam wondered when Walter’s last shower was. The man could definitely use one. But odd as it was to be greeted pleasantly by the father of a girl you’d gotten killed, odder still was the figure standing at the stove.</p><p>Sam froze when he saw her. From the back, she looked like Trish. Same height and build, same hair, same clothes she’d been wearing when they’d hiked to the Herald House yesterday. She was lifting bacon out of the frying pan with a fork and depositing it on a plate covered with a folded-over paper towel to soak up excess grease. Instead of a deep brown color, the bacon was charcoal-black, and Sam knew she—whoever she was—had burned it. When the plate was filled with bacon, she dropped the fork to the floor, as if now that she longer needed it, it had ceased to exist for her. Then she picked up the bacon plate and without bothering to turn off the burner, turned and walked toward them.</p><p>Sam’s gaze was drawn to the dark stain on her sweater first. It was dry now, and almost black, like the bacon she carried. Then he raised his eyes and forced himself to look at her face.</p><p>It <em>was</em> Trish. Her skin had a sallow cast to it, and her features were slack, utterly void of expression. And her eyes... they were wide and staring, and they looked glassy-hard, like marbles.</p><p>When Sam had been younger, he and Dean had taken a trip with their father. He couldn’t remember where to or for what reason. Just another long car ride, and another few nights in a hotel with only Dean to take care of him while their father was out doing whatever he had gone there to do. Somewhere along the way, they’d stopped for gas at a small out-of-the-way station. Sam had needed to use the bathroom, so Dean took him while their dad paid for the gas. The restrooms were located inside the station, and as Dean escorted him through, Sam was startled to see a fox standing on the counter. At first he’d thought it was real, the owner’s pet, maybe. Then after a second he saw that it stood perfectly still, and he realized it wasn’t a real fox, or rather, it had been real once, but it was no longer alive. It had been stuffed and mounted. It was kind of creepy, but also kind of cool. When he was done peeing, Sam made sure to walk by the counter so he could get a good look at the fox. Close up, he could see that some of the fox’s stitching was coming loose, and a fine coating of dust had settled onto its fur. But the worst part was its eyes. Glossy black and lifeless, they were like doll eyes, only worse, because someone had removed this animal’s real eyes and glued the fake ones into the sockets.</p><p>That’s what Trish’s eyes looked like now. Dead doll eyes.</p><p>He looked to Dean and saw his brother staring at Trish with an expression of shock. Sam was sure he looked the same. Neither of them made a move to take a seat at the table with Trish’s father.</p><p>She carried the bacon-filled plate to the table and stood there, staring off into space. She made no move to serve it.</p><p>Walter saw the brothers staring at Trish, and gave them a smile and a wink. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way—especially when you work with hunters. A lot of them can’t afford to pay me in cash, so they settle their bill the old-fashioned way: with barter. I’ve picked up all kinds of interesting objects over the years. Sometimes I sell them to hunters who can use them, but most of the time I just put them away, figuring maybe I’ll find a use for them someday.” He reached into his pants pocket, withdrew an object, and set it on the table. It was a small obsidian statue of a dog-headed man wearing an ancient Egyptian headdress.</p><p>“Recognize this fellow? It’s Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead. He’s not much in the height department, but he kicks ass when it comes to bringing folks back from what Shakespeare called ‘the undiscovered country.’” He looked up at Trish and smiled. “Isn’t that right, sweetie?”</p><p>Trish opened her mouth as if she intended to reply, but all that came out was a thin stream of drool that fell onto the bacon.</p><p>Walter turned back to the brothers and grinned. “So, who’s hungry?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>From the outside, the NuFlesh Biotech office looked the same as it had yesterday, but as Sam and Dean got out of the car and headed for the door, it burst open and Dr. Martinez’s office assistant came running out. The slender woman looked absolutely terrified, and without realizing where she was going, she ran directly into Dean. She didn’t have a lot of meat on her, and the collision sent her stumbling backward as if she’d run full force into a brick wall. Dean managed to reach out and grab her arms in time to stop her from falling on her bony posterior.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” he asked. “Has something happened?”</p><p>He groaned inwardly. He hated it when people in horror movies asked stupid questions like that. <em>Of course</em> something had happened! Why else would she be running as if she had a pack of Hellhounds on her tail?</p><p>At first her gaze refused to focus on either Dean or his brother, and her lower lip kept quivering. He was beginning to fear that she’d taken the last exit to Loonyville, but then she spoke.</p><p>“It’s Doctor Martinez. He’s... he’s not well.” She tore free from Dean’s grip with surprising strength for such a petite woman and ran into the parking lot. If she had a car there, she didn’t bother with it. She just kept going until she reached the sidewalk and was gone.</p><p>“I’d say that definitely qualifies as a bad sign,” Dean said.</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>The brothers drew their pistols—both weapons reloaded and ready to go—and entered NuFlesh.</p><p>The reception area was empty, which made sense, as its usual sole occupant had just high-tailed it for the hills. Dean held up his hand for Sam to stop for a moment, and the two of them listened. At first Dean didn’t hear anything, but then he was able to make out a voice singing softly.</p><p>“The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out, the worms play pinochle on your snout.</p><p>“That’s a little creepy,” Dean whispered.</p><p>“More than a little,” Sam replied.</p><p>Together the brothers headed down the hall toward Martinez’s office. The singing grew louder the closer they got, the same phrase, repeated over and over in a childish singsong tone. Martinez’s door was half open, and Dean debated the merits of calling out to the doctor or going in silent, guns at the ready.</p><p>He didn’t have to make the choice, as the door opened the rest of the way and Martinez stepped into the hall. He stopped when he saw the Winchesters. If he noticed they’d drawn their pistols, it didn’t seem to bother him.</p><p>“Hello, agents! I didn’t expect to see you again so soon. What can I help you with?” His voice was a thick, liquid burble, almost impossible to understand.</p><p>Dean and Sam could only stand and stare. They’d seen some genuinely awful things in their lives, but this qualified for the top ten, easy.</p><p>Martinez’s skin had taken on a bright pink color that reminded Dean of the nasty slime fast-food burgers were made from, and it sagged from his bones like melting wax. The flesh had drawn away from his eyes and mouth, giving his face a skull-like aspect, and his hair had slid down the left side of his face like a toupee that refused to stay put. His ears dangled from thin pink strands that hung from his head like braids, and his fingers stretched all the way to the floor. The flesh from his legs had run out of his pants cuffs to overflow his shoes, making it look as if he had thick pink stumps instead of feet. His chin had become a long tendril that stretched past his chest and wobbled horribly when he spoke.</p><p>Dean turned toward his brother. “Sam, remember when I said this job reminded me of <em>Frankenstein?</em> I changed my mind. We are way into <em>Reanimator</em> territory here!”</p><p>Martinez went on as if Dean hadn’t spoken. “I hope you haven’t come for any samples of NuFlesh to compare with what you found on that nightmarish beast you showed me yesterday.” He spoke almost cheerfully in his burbling voice, as if nothing was wrong. “I’m afraid I traded the last of my supply to a special customer of mine. He provides me with a special unguent that relieves the itching caused by my burn scars and—“</p><p>That was the last word Martinez got out before his lower jaw detached from his skull and tumbled to the floor. It landed with a plop in the widening pool of pink goo that spread outward from his feet, and Sam and Dean scooted back to avoid contact with the disgusting substance. Dean had seen the <em>Blob</em> movies, and he knew how dangerous nasty goo could be. Pinkish slime continued running from Martinez’s skeleton, flowing like syrup, and individual bones came loose without muscles, ligaments, or cartilage to hold them in place. His form began to lose shape and fold in upon itself, though his eyes remained unaffected, darting back and forth in confusion, as if he’d finally come to realize that something was terribly wrong but wasn’t able to determine what. Then Martinez lost what little solidity remained to him, and his skeleton collapsed, leaving nothing but a pile of bones, his clothing, and a mound of watery goo. Only his eyes remained, housed in the skull, which sat lopsided atop the pink mound. They looked up at Sam and Dean, whatever emotion they might have held unreadable, until at last they too melted away to nothing.</p><p>“I’m never going to eat ice cream again,” Dean said. “Or chew bubble gum.”</p><p>Sam looked as if he might lose the gallon or so of coffee he’d drunk so far that morning. “I’m right there with you, brother.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“I’ve been using the basement as a lab for weeks now, and I still haven’t gotten used to how chilly it is down here. Sometimes I feel as if I should be wearing a parka instead of a lab coat. But the cold’s good for you, isn’t it, sweetie?”</p><p>She smiled down at her daughter. Bekah lay naked on the table, a white sheet covering her from the neck down. Even though it was just the two of them, Catherine wanted to give Bekah her dignity. Catherine might be her mother—not to mention a doctor—but Bekah was a teenager, nearly an adult, and her body was her own. The last thing Catherine wanted to do was treat her like a piece of meat.</p><p><em>Like you treated that poor dog?</em> she asked herself.</p><p>That was different. That creature was a test subject, its only purpose to help Catherine determine how effective NuFlesh—with Conrad’s special “enhancements”—was at fusing body parts from different donors. Both Bekah and Marshall’s bodies had suffered severe damage in the accident, and it had been necessary to replace numerous organs, tissue, and in a couple cases, entire limbs. A good half of Bekah’s face had needed reconstruction, and only one of her original blue eyes remained to her. The other was now brown. Beneath the sheet, her body was crisscrossed by faint scar lines of NuFlesh indicating where Catherine had operated on her. She’d taken far more care with Bekah than she had with the dog, so the scars were hardly noticeable. She’d been even more careful with her daughter’s face, working diligently to ensure that the skin looked as smooth and natural as possible. When Bekah was... well again, Catherine wanted her to like what she saw in the mirror.</p><p>During the last few weeks Catherine had often felt more like a sculptor than a doctor, though with her medium being flesh instead of clay. Conrad had encouraged her to view her work that way.</p><p><em>We want strong, healthy bodies for your family,</em> he’d once told her. <em>That is, of course, the ultimate goal. At its best the human form possesses an elegance and beauty unrivaled in nature. So we want to make sure that not only are your loved ones restored to life, but that the bodies that house that life are worthy of the gods themselves.</em></p><p>Conrad often spoke like that, almost as if he was a poet instead of... whatever he was. Catherine didn’t see her work in such lofty terms, but she wanted Bekah and Marshall to be comfortable with their restored bodies, wanted them to be able to go out in public without drawing attention. Simply put, she wanted them to be as normal as possible, given the circumstances. She certainly didn’t want them to turn out to be freakish monstrosities, like the dog. But then, she hadn’t been concerned with aesthetics when she’d made it, only in testing the efficacy of NuFlesh. And, of course, in proving that Conrad’s resurrection techniques worked.</p><p>At least she didn’t have to worry about the dog anymore. Conrad had let her know that the beast had been disposed of. He’d provided no details, and she’d asked for none. One of the key aspects of their working relationship was that she didn’t press him for information, and he didn’t tell her things that she’d prefer not to hear. It was better that way.</p><p>Bekah’s long hair was a deep rich brown, and Catherine loved to brush it. The action reminded her of when Bekah had been a child, unable—or truth to tell, unwilling—to brush her own hair. Even when Catherine had finally managed to get the girl to go into the bathroom and brush, she always “forgot” to do the back, leaving it to Catherine to finish the job. Bekah had grown out of that phase eventually, and Catherine had been surprised to find herself missing it. She’d enjoyed the sweet intimacy of touching her daughter’s hair, of running the brush through it, of chatting with Bekah about this and that while she worked.</p><p>She was tempted to get a brush and spend a few minutes grooming Bekah’s hair now, but she resisted. She hadn’t removed Bekah from the freezer and laid her out on the table so she could play Mommy. She had work to do. She’d begin with the head.</p><p>Many were the wonders that Conrad had shown her during the course of their collaboration, and although she was a rational woman, she had come to believe that there was, if not magic in the world, far more to science that she’d ever suspected. One of the most amazing things he had taught her was the formula for creating a chemical mixture that could reverse the cellular damage caused by decay. In and of itself it did not restore life, but it prevented dead bodies from rotting, which given the amount of time Catherine had needed to have Bekah and Marshall out of the freezer and on the table so she could work with them, was vital. However, the treatment wasn’t permanent, and when it wore off, not only did decay return, it did so with a vengeance, accelerating exponentially until the subject was nothing but a fleshless skeleton, as she’d learned from observing numerous test subjects. Rats, mostly, and in one case, a stray cat Conrad had brought her. The results of accelerated decay were unpleasant to observe, to say the least, and it was a fate she was determined to avoid for her husband and daughter. So every few days Catherine checked Bekah and Marshall to make sure they hadn’t begun to actively decay once more. If she’d had an unending supply of the treatment, she’d use it on them every day, but the ingredients weren’t easy to come by, and the process for creating the mixture was quite involved. A mistake at any step along the way would render the result useless. So Catherine made sure to employ the treatment only when it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>The results were almost beyond belief. When Bekah had been little, many was the time that Catherine had crept into her room at night, ostensibly to check and make certain she was all right, but in reality because she simply loved watching her daughter sleep. She was always so still—no restless sleeper, she—and her breathing was so gentle that Catherine had to lean down close to hear it. Now, looking at Bekah lying on the table, her features awash in the harsh glow of fluorescent light, Catherine had no trouble imagining that she wasn’t dead, that she was merely sleeping as sound as ever, waiting for her mother to rouse her.</p><p>In a way, she supposed that was true.</p><p><em>Enough woolgathering.</em> She had work to do. She began her examination with Bekah’s feet.</p><p>She lifted the sheet and began searching for any discoloration on the skin. Finding none, she drew the sheet back further and moved on to the legs. She was in the process of examining the torso when she heard footsteps on the kitchen floor overhead. Conrad had arrived.</p><p>She rearranged the sheet to cover her daughter’s body once more, then leaned close to Bekah’s ear and whispered, “Don’t worry. I know you don’t like it when he looks at you. We’ll finish the examination later, when he’s gone.”</p><p>She heard the basement door open, and she straightened and took a step back from the table. She saw nothing wrong in talking to her daughter, but she never did so in front of Conrad. She wasn’t worried that he’d think her crazy. He was a bit odd himself, to put it mildly. But her conversations with Bekah—one-sided though they might be—were private, meant to be kept between mother and daughter.</p><p>He came down the stairs, moving gracefully despite being burdened with a large cardboard box. It looked as if it was heavy, but he carried it with ease. She wasn’t surprised. She’d long known he was stronger than he looked.</p><p>“More supplies?” she asked.</p><p>Conrad reached the basement floor and walked to one of the counters where he set the box down on one of the few empty spaces to be found. He removed his lab coat from the hook on the wall where it had been hanging, slipped it on over his suit jacket, and then joined Catherine by Bekah’s side.</p><p>“More NuFlesh,” he said. “We’re going to need it.”</p><p>“Good.” She’d finished restoring Bekah’s body for the most part, but there were still a few things she wanted to do to Marshall’s. Then she frowned. “Wait, what do you mean, ‘We’re going to need it’? You sound as if you have something special in mind.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. She disliked it when he did that. He had a habit of giving her a smile that she imagined a cat might show to a small rodent an instant before pouncing.</p><p>“I do indeed! Feast your eyes, my dear, upon <em>this.”</em> He removed a small object from his jacket pocket and held it out for her inspection.</p><p>At first, it didn’t look like much to her. It was an oblong stone of deep blue, its surface polished smooth. Then she realized that instead of catching and reflecting the light, the stone seemed to absorb it, and not gently. It grabbed hold of the light and dragged it down into whatever untold depths lay within.</p><p>She blinked. For a moment, she’d felt almost hypnotized by the stone, and it took an effort to tear her gaze from it and focus on Conrad once more.</p><p>“What is it?” She kept her tone neutral, but inside she was burning with excitement. She could sense the power the stone exuded, and she knew that Conrad had indeed brought her something special today. Very special.</p><p>“It’s called the Lapis Occultus,” he explained. “A token of great power.”</p><p>“Can I... hold it?” She was almost afraid to ask. The longer she looked at the stone, the less distinct its outline became, as if it radiated some kind of energy that distorted the air around it.</p><p>“Of course.” He held it out to her, and she took it with trembling hands. It was then she caught a glimpse of Conrad’s right palm and saw the black X marring the flesh.</p><p>She frowned. “What happened to you?”</p><p>“It’s nothing of consequence. The materials we work with can be dangerous, as you well know, and I wasn’t as careful as I should have been. It will heal in due course.”</p><p>The symmetrical shape of the mark made it look deliberate. If the affected area hadn’t been raised, she might’ve thought it was a tattoo.</p><p>Before she could think on the matter further, her attention was drawn back to the object she held. The Lapis Occultus, Latin for dark stone.</p><p>It was cool to the touch, and seemed to almost vibrate in her hand, as if it was charged with power. In fact, the longer she held it, the more she had the sense that it was somehow alive. She thought she could even hear a voice, so faint it was almost imperceptible, calling to her as if from a great distance. A man’s voice, she thought, but she couldn’t make out what it was saying.</p><p>Conrad took the stone from her hand, and the voice was cut off. Catherine felt momentarily disoriented, as if she’d just awakened from a dream. She shook her head as if to clear it. No doubt about it, she needed to get more rest.</p><p>She forced herself to look away from the stone and meet Conrad’s gaze. “What does it do?”</p><p>“It is the final piece of the puzzle, Catherine. With it, we can ensure that your husband and daughter’s bodies will be completely resistant to decay once they are resurrected.”</p><p>She stared at the stone in Conrad’s hand, unable to believe what she’d heard. The problem of decay was the one impediment to successful resurrection of the dead. You could restore them to life, even create a new being from separate parts, but regardless of how careful you were, the resurrected would eventually begin to decay, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, but it was inevitable. She had observed this in one test subject after another. It was almost as if they had a force eating them away from the inside. The effect was more pronounced when pieces from separate donors were joined, most likely due to tissue rejection. NuFlesh helped slow the process of decay a great deal, but it could only forestall it so long.</p><p>If the Lapis Occultus could do what Conrad claimed, then there was no reason to wait any longer. They could begin resurrecting Bekah and Marshall right away! But if the stone didn’t function as Conrad promised, she would be restoring her husband and daughter to life only to condemn them to a slow, painful second death.</p><p>“I can see the hesitation on your face,” Conrad said. “When I first came to you, you were skeptical of what I claimed I could do, but have I not proved myself to you time and again? I know to one such as yourself, schooled in the ways of modern science, the Lapis Occultus must appear to be nothing more than a mere gem. Pretty enough, but certainly not capable of performing miracles. Yet you held it in your hand, Catherine. <em>You felt</em> its power. You cannot deny the evidence of your own senses.”</p><p>She had felt the stone’s power. She didn’t understand it, but she knew it was real. And Conrad had been able to deliver on every promise he’d made so far, no matter how impossible it might have seemed at the time. Surely he’d earned her trust by now. Beyond all that, though, was the fact that she missed Marshall and Bekah so very much. They’d been separated too long. It was high time they were a family again.</p><p>“All right.” Now that she’d accepted the Lapis Occultus as genuine, she could feel her excitement rising. “Bekah’s body is complete, and she’s already on the table. I’ll give her a thorough examination to make sure she’s ready and then—“</p><p>“Perhaps we should begin with your husband.”</p><p>Catherine had already turned toward Bekah, intending to get to work right away, but Conrad’s words stopped her. She turned to look at him, frowning. “Marshall isn’t ready. He still needs a few finishing touches. Bekah—“</p><p>Conrad stepped forward and reached out to touch Catherine’s arm. Even through the sleeve of her lab coat and the sweater beneath, she could feel how cold his hand was.</p><p>“I understand your eagerness to proceed, and in my own way I share it.”</p><p>There was something in his tone of voice that made Catherine think there was a hidden meaning to the last part of his statement, but Conrad went on before she could consider it further.</p><p>“I have every confidence that the Lapis Occultus will function properly, but I must admit that I have never used it before. Not in this way, at least. I think it might be prudent to test it first.”</p><p>“You want to use <em>Marshall</em> as a test subject?” The thought horrified her.</p><p>“If he was alive, and this were a more... mundane medical procedure that both he and your daughter needed, a procedure that carried with it a certain amount of risk, what do you think he would do?”</p><p>Catherine knew exactly what her husband would do. The same as she would under similar circumstances.</p><p>“He’d insist on going through the procedure first to make sure it was safe.”</p><p>Conrad’s face betrayed no reaction to her words, but she felt a sense of satisfaction from him, as if he’d won an important battle.</p><p>“How long do you anticipate it will take to ready your husband’s body for the procedure?”</p><p>She considered. “All the major organs are in place and properly connected. The nervous system could use more tweaking, but it’s essentially finished. Really, all that’s left are mainly cosmetic touches. The nose isn’t as straight as I’d like, he’s still missing several teeth—and there’s the tongue, of course. That’s what will take the most time. But with the new... donations you acquired the other night, along with a fresh supply of NuFlesh, I’d say Marshall could be ready to go in two, maybe three hours.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Excellent. Shall we begin?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After Dr. Martinez had, as Dean put it, turned into a “soft nougaty center,” the brothers split up and searched through the NuFlesh offices, looking for any clue to the location of Conrad Dippel’s home base. As they moved from room to room, they had to be careful not to step in Martinez’s liquefied remains pooling in the hall, which were beginning to smell almost as bad as Frankenmutt’s. When they were finished, the brothers compared notes in the reception area.</p><p>“There was nothing on Martinez’s computer or in his desk,” Sam said. “He left his phone in his office, but there was no number or address in it for Dippel. No texts or emails, either.”</p><p>“Same with Ms. Speedy Gonzalez,” Dean said. “Both her computer and desk were fresh out of Dippel, too. Did you see anything with your, uh, death vision?”</p><p>Dean still didn’t know how he felt about Sam’s latest revelation. If it was true, it meant that his brother’s infection was worse than he’d suspected. If it wasn’t true, it meant that his hallucinations were starting up again. Hell, it could be both: the infection might be causing such a strain on his system that it was provoking hallucinations. That was the thing about being a hunter. When you lived in a world where the impossible not only existed, it wanted to tear your throat out and feast on your insides, real was a slippery concept at best.</p><p>“I found this in his office trash.” Sam held up an empty glass vial. The inside of the glass contained residue of some thick, greenish-yellow substance.</p><p>“Dippel’s special unguent,” Dean said, then frowned. “What the hell is an <em>unguent</em> anyway?”</p><p>“Kind of like a medicinal cream,” Sam said.</p><p>“Looks more like snot. Can you imagine the TV commercial for that stuff? ‘Side effects may include sudden goo-ification.’” He paused as a thought occurred to him. “You think maybe Dippel messed with the formula to make sure it killed Martinez?”</p><p>“Maybe, but why would he off the only supplier of NuFlesh in the world?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Maybe he’s learned how to make it for himself. Or maybe he just doesn’t give a damn. He <em>is</em> an immortal psychopath, after all.”</p><p>“I suppose. But it could’ve been an accident, too. Maybe Martinez used more than the recommended dose.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then given what happened to him, I’d say he used <em>way</em> more.”</p><p>“So what do we do now?” Sam asked. “Go check out Martinez’s home, see if there’s any info on Dippel in his home computer?”</p><p>“I doubt he’d have Dippel’s address stuck to his refrigerator door. Whatever we do, we’d better step on it. Once the local police see Martinez’s remains—such as they are—they’re going to freak. They’ll put another call into the CDC, maybe even fax some pictures of Martinez’s bones-and-pink-goo-stew, and once that happens...”</p><p>“Brennan will be crawling with CDC personnel.”</p><p>Dean nodded. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they dropped a giant plastic dome over the whole damn town. If the CDC shows up in force, Dippel will go to ground or get the hell out of Dodge. Either way, we’ll have a tough time finding him after that.”</p><p>Sam yawned. “We could get rid of the goo, so there’s nothing for the police to find.”</p><p>“Now I know you’re half asleep. You’d never suggest anything that stupid when you’re on your game.” Dean started counting points off on his fingers. “For one thing, I’m not touching what’s left of Martinez. We don’t know just how toxic that goo is. For another, even if we could find a safe way to move that crap, it’ll still leave residue for the cops to find, and the CDC after them. And remember, the receptionist saw Martinez when he was in the process of melting, so we could only conceal what happened to him for so long. Hell, she may have already reported his condition to the cops. So, if we move Martinez’s goo-mains and the cops find out, they’re going to start thinking some kind of conspiracy’s going on in their town, which could end up bringing in the real Feds, or maybe Homeland Security. Either way, the heat would get turned up real high, real fast.”</p><p>“Yeah. I see what you mean. Sorry.” Sam stifled another yawn.</p><p>Dean was really starting to get worried. If Sam’s infection continued spreading, his reflexes could be dulled to the point where he might not be able to defend himself in a fight. After that, how much longer would it be before he didn’t have enough energy to move? He might even slip into a coma. They needed to track down Dippel if they were to have any hope of finding a cure for Sam’s condition. Otherwise, Dean was afraid his brother wasn’t going to make it. Dean wasn’t about to let that happen. They’d been through too much together—life and death, Heaven and Hell, and everything between. Dean wasn’t going to let his brother down. He’d die—again—first.</p><p>“Maybe Dippel has another Igor,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean had been so caught up in his thoughts that Sam’s words didn’t register with him at first. “What?”</p><p>“Martinez supplied Dippel with NuFlesh, and in turn Dippel gave him the anti-itch cream. Martinez described it as a trade, which suggests it wasn’t a medical collaboration. If Dippel had help making his creations, he probably wouldn’t go to a biochemist anyway. He’d want someone with a medical background. A physician or maybe even a veterinarian.”</p><p>Dean smiled. “Maybe you’ve still got a few functioning brain cells left after all. But if there is another Igor, how do we find him or her? We can’t just look up every doctor in the Brennan area, drop by their office, and say, ‘Excuse me, but have you built any monsters out of dead body parts lately?’”</p><p>“Dippel would need to find someone shady to work with, someone he could blackmail, if necessary. We need to find out if there are any doctors or vets in town who’ve got a sketchy reputation, maybe even been in trouble with the law.”</p><p>“Looks like we need to pay a visit to Brennan’s finest,” Dean said. They’d already spoken to the sheriff when they’d first begun investigating the strange deaths in town. They could easily claim they’d returned to follow up on some unspecified leads they’d gathered. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Dean started toward the door, but before he reached it, Sam said. “On the way, can we—“</p><p>Dean sighed. “We’ll stop for coffee, don’t worry.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“What do you think she’s doing? Is she sleeping or just lying awake and staring at the ceiling?”</p><p>Dean didn’t want to talk about it. He kept his mouth shut and hoped Sam would do the same. They were in their room at the Hansens’ cabin, Sam sitting cross-legged on his bed, Dean sitting on the floor, his back against the wall, legs stretched out in front of him. There was a lamp on top of a dresser between their beds, and the light was on. Neither brother had said anything, but they didn’t want to be in the dark, not with Trish—or whatever she’d become—in the house. Dean had also locked their door. He had no idea if it would keep Trish out if she wanted in, but even a little protection was better than none at all.</p><p>“What do you think she is?” Sam asked. “Is she a zombie?”</p><p>“Zombies are made by voodoo,” Dean said in a tone that indicated this was the most obvious thing in the world. “You saw that little statue her dad had. It was Egyptian.”</p><p>“So she’s like a mummy, only with no bandages?”</p><p>“I don’t know <em>what</em> she is!” Dean snapped. Sam recoiled as if he’d been struck, and Dean felt instantly ashamed. Sam was scared, that’s all. Truth was, so was he. When he spoke again, he did so quietly, in a voice that was little more than a whisper. “Whatever she is, she’s not Trish anymore.”</p><p>The day had been one of the most bizarre that Dean had experienced, and given his dad’s job, that was saying something. Trish hadn’t spoken a single word, and her face never displayed emotion—or any expression at all, for that matter. At first, Dean had thought she didn’t blink anymore, but after a while, he realized she did, only far more slowly than a normal person. He’d read somewhere that people blink an average of once every five seconds. Trish blinked once every minute. She didn’t move much, only when her dad asked her to do something. When she did move, she did so with precise, economical motions, like a machine that had been programmed for maximum efficiency. When she wasn’t doing anything, she was so still she might have been a wax figure created in the image of the real Trish. And she never sat. She always stood, and if she was in the way, you had to go around her. Not only didn’t she step aside, there was nothing in her eyes or expression to indicate that she was even aware of another presence.</p><p>Walter Hansen didn’t seem to notice that there was anything wrong with his daughter. Dean had heard the phrase “in denial” before, but this was the first time he’d seen it in action. Normally, Walter spent most of the day down in his workshop, preparing documents for his clients, but today he remained upstairs, keeping up a running one-sided conversation with Trish. He spoke about things they had done back when her mother was alive, holidays they’d celebrated, trips they’d taken... He spoke about plans for the future, too. Places they’d never gotten around to visiting that they’d go to soon, renovations he wanted to do to the cabin, changes he wanted to make in their lives. Maybe they’d get a cat or a dog. Trish had always wanted a dog, hadn’t she?</p><p>Trish stood there, motionless, never speaking. Dean had no idea if she heard her father’s words, or if she did, if she understood them.</p><p>Whatever command Walter gave her, she obeyed, and after having her make breakfast, he had her do a series of chores around the cabin. She ran the sweeper, dusted, and did several loads of laundry, and all the while Walter followed her around, talking. In the afternoon, Walter had the four of them sit down and watch TV. Well, three of them. Trish remained standing. Walter put on a rerun of an old sitcom, and he joined in with the laugh track, laughing loud, as if the show—which Dean had seen before and didn’t think was all that funny—was the most hilarious thing he’d ever viewed. There was an edge of hysteria to Walter’s laughter that Dean found just as creepy as Trish’s immobile, stone-faced presence, and after a while he couldn’t take it anymore. He told Walter that he and Sam were going to go out and gather some firewood, despite the fact that there was a healthy supply already stacked up next to the cabin, and Walter said, “Sure, sure. Good idea.” He didn’t take his gaze off the TV screen as he answered, and Dean and Sam lost no time in getting the hell out of there.</p><p>They didn’t bother pretending to get firewood. Instead, they wandered through the woods around the Hansens’ cabin, not speaking, just walking. Each alone with the guilt that was eating them up from the inside.</p><p>They stayed out past dinner—no way did they want to suffer through another meal prepared by maybe-a-zombie, maybe-something-else Trish—and they finally came in around nine. They went straight to bed, but before they could hole up in their room, Walter told them to make sure they got a good night’s rest.</p><p>“Tomorrow we’ll go fishing at the lake,” he said. “Then later, we’ll head into town for ice cream and a movie. How does that sound?”</p><p><em>Like a nightmare,</em> Dean had thought. “Sounds good,” he’d said. Then he and Sam hurried to their room, closed the door, and locked it.</p><p>That had been two hours ago. For most of that time the boys had remained silent, listening to the drone of Walter’s perpetual one-sided conversation with his undead daughter. Eventually, Walter decided to go to bed, but not before leading Trish to her room, and—Dean presumed—tucking her in. He wondered if Walter gave her a goodnight kiss, maybe on the forehead, maybe on the cheek. If so, did her skin feel normal, or was it cold and waxy? The thought made him shudder.</p><p>“What are we going to do?” Sam asked in a small voice.</p><p>This was the question Dean had been dreading all day. He was the older brother, and with their dad away, it was only natural that Sam would look to him for guidance in this situation. It was his responsibility to look after his brother—as their father had made abundantly clear to him on many occasions. He had nearly failed in that responsibility yesterday, when he’d been dumb enough to lead Sam to the Herald House. He’d thought he was so smart, that he was a big-time hunter, just because he’d picked up one or two things from listening to his dad. Trish had paid for his arrogance with her life, but it could’ve just as easily been Sammy who’d taken a spectral bullet to the heart.</p><p>Once, in some hotel room or other, when Sam had been asleep, their father had turned to Dean and said, “Son, there’s not a lot of advice that I can pass along to you about life. Real life, I mean. Not the kind of life hunters lead. But I know this: never let the little head do the thinking for the big head.”</p><p>That had been a few years back, and Dean hadn’t been exactly sure at the time what his dad had been trying to tell him. But he understood now. Boy, did he understand! Everything that had happened had been his fault, and all because he’d wanted to act like a big man and impress a girl. An amazing girl who had died and been brought back to some grotesque semblance of life by her grief-stricken, and more than a little crazy, father.</p><p>Dean didn’t know if he believed in souls. He knew ghosts were real, and if he hadn’t known it before, he surely would have after the previous day’s encounter with the Rifleman. But he thought ghosts might not be the consciousness of a person that continued to exist after death so much as some kind of psychic energy that was left behind. Energy that took on the shape and behavior of the person who created it, but wasn’t literally that person. If that was true, then Trish—her mind, her spirit, her essence—hadn’t been brought back, only her body. She was an empty shell, little more than a puppet for Walter to command. If there were souls, though, then it was possible that Trish’s had returned with her physical form, but was trapped within, unable to do more than passively observe, a prisoner in her own body. <em>It would be,</em> Dean thought, <em>the very definition of a living hell.</em> And it was all his fault.</p><p>“The first thing we do,” he told Sam, “is find some weapons.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>They moved silently through the cabin. Both Walter and Trish’s bedroom doors were closed, but Dean knew that didn’t mean either of them was asleep. Especially Trish. It was very possible that she didn’t need to sleep anymore, that she was—as Sam had said—just lying on her bed, eyes open and staring, blinking only once per minute.</p><p>They entered the kitchen, and each selected a large knife from the block on the counter. They searched through the drawers, careful to open and close them slowly so as not to make the contents rattle, but all they found were a couple screwdrivers in a junk drawer. Dean took the Phillips, Sam the flathead. What Dean really wanted to find was a gun. Their dad had made sure that both of them knew how to shoot, and even if neither of them was a highly skilled marksman, they could do more than merely hit the broad side of a barn. If they found more than one gun, Dean wouldn’t have let Sam carry one, though. Sam was an okay shot, if not as good as him yet, but if their dad ever found out he let Sam use a gun without his express permission... Well, Dean would rather face an entire town full of vengeful ghosts than John Winchester when he was angry.</p><p>“Should we go down into the basement and look?” Sam asked. “If Walter has any guns, he might keep them down there.”</p><p>Dean found himself feeling proud of his little brother. He was obviously scared, but not only was he keeping himself together, he was thinking strategically. Dean knew Sam was smart—smarter than him, that was for sure—but sometimes he forgot just how smart.</p><p>Dean thought it over. If Walter sometimes let hunters pay him in trade, he probably did have a few guns somewhere, and his workshop seemed like a logical place to keep them. He could have other things down there, too—items more powerful and dangerous than firearms. He’d said the Egyptian statue he’d used to bring Trish back had come from one of his clients. He might have other magical objects in the basement, maybe even something that could reverse the spell that had resurrected Trish.</p><p><em>Don’t be an idiot,</em> Dean told himself. <em>It’s not like any items Walter has will be labeled and come with a set of instructions.</em> If Walter did have any more magic goodies downstairs, they would be extremely dangerous to use, assuming he and Sam could even get them to work in the first place. They were better off sticking with simple weapons, ones that wouldn’t backfire and turn you into a pile of ash, or worse. But they really could use a gun. Dean didn’t know what sort of creature Trish had become, but he figured that they should avoid getting too close to her. He’d seen <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> maybe a dozen times, and the last thing he wanted was for Trish to sink her teeth into either him or Sam and turn them into flesh-eating zombies. Knives and screwdrivers were only good for close-up fighting, but with a gun, they could deal with her from a distance.</p><p><em>Listen to you! You’re thinking about killing a girl you had the hots for yesterday!</em></p><p>Dean thrust the thought away. He’d learned from watching his father that sometimes a hunter had to put his emotions aside in order to get the job done. Despite the fact that they were in this situation because of his screw up, he was determined to live up to his father’s example and do the job right.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go check the basement. But we’ve got to be quick. There’s no telling—“</p><p>He broke off as he heard sounds come from down the hallway: a soft creak followed close by another, and that followed a muffled click. Dean felt his gut turn to ice.</p><p>“Trish left her room,” Sam whispered, “and went into Walter’s.”</p><p>That’s exactly how Dean saw it. No time to look for guns now.</p><p>They left the kitchen and hurried down the hallway, Dean’s instincts screaming for him to move faster. They carried their weapons down at their sides so they wouldn’t accidently injure themselves or one another, and when they reached Walter’s door, they stopped. Enough light spilled into the hall from the kitchen for them to see that Trish’s bedroom door was open. The interior was dark, which only made sense. Why would she need light anymore?</p><p>Dean shifted his knife to his left hand, with the screwdriver. He then reached out and tried the knob of Walter’s door. He wasn’t surprised to find it locked. He returned his knife to his right hand, then turned to Sam and whispered, “Get ready.”</p><p>He’d seen cops break into locked rooms on TV and in the movies, but he’d never tried to do it himself before. <em>There’s a first time for everything,</em> their dad always said. Dean stepped back, raised his right leg, and slammed his foot against the door next to the knob. He had to repeat this maneuver twice more before the door finally burst open and swung inward.</p><p>Dean entered first, Sam right behind.</p><p>Walter’s nightstand light was on, and in its dim glow, Dean could see the man sitting up in bed, Trish crouched on the mattress next to him, her face buried in his neck.</p><p>He smiled weakly, his face pale. “It’s okay. She just wanted a snack. A little something to tide her over until morning.” He reached up a trembling hand and stroked Trish’s hair. “Wouldn’t want my girl to go to bed with an empty belly now, would I?”</p><p>In the future, when Dean would remember this moment, several horrible details would stand out. One was that despite what his daughter was doing to him, Walter didn’t cry out in pain. How detached from reality did you have to be not to feel someone tearing into your flesh with their teeth? Then there was the blood. Despite Trish’s best efforts to swallow as much as she could, blood stained the front of Walter’s T-shirt and soaked the sheet drawn up to his waist. Another was the wet smacking sounds that Trish made as she nuzzled at her father’s neck, sounds more like those of a baby animal suckling from its mother than an undead thing chewing on living meat. She’d been silent all day, but now sounds of satisfaction rumbled softly in Trish’s throat, almost like a cat’s purring. As bad as all these details were, though—and that was damned bad, make no mistake—the absolute worst for Dean was the look in Walter’s eyes. In them, Dean could see that, at least on some level, the man knew exactly what his daughter had become and what she was doing to him. Yet still he loved her, deeply, fiercely, and he would give her whatever she needed, even at the cost of his own life.</p><p>It was at that moment that Dean realized that as awful as hate was, love, unthinking and unrestrained, could be far more terrible.</p><p>Trish drew away from her father, ropey strands of blood stretching from her mouth to the ragged mess that had been his neck, and turned to regard Sam and Dean.</p><p>Dean thought there’d be hunger in her gaze, or rage, or maybe even sorrow, because deep down somewhere inside that cold, dead body she was still Trish, and she was horrified by what she had become, by what she was driven to do, but what he saw in her eyes was far worse. Her gaze was empty of all thought and emotion, bereft of the slightest sense of identity. Her eyes lacked even the basic self-awareness that an animal possesses. They were as empty as the largest subterranean caverns, as cold as the deepest arctic waters. Dean knew he was looking at something far worse than simple evil in her gaze. He was looking at nothing.</p><p>“Dean...”</p><p>“It’s all right, Sammy.” He knew damn well that it wasn’t, that after this nothing would ever be all right again, but he said it because he was the big brother, and it was the kind of thing you were supposed to say when things were bad. And he couldn’t imagine things getting much worse than this.</p><p>Trish began crawling toward them across the bed, her father’s blood dribbling from her mouth, pattering on the comforter like thick drops of crimson rain.</p><p>Dean wished to God he had a gun, but he didn’t, he had a knife and a Phillips screwdriver. And he had what his dad had always told him was the most important weapon of all. Himself. He switched the screwdriver to his right hand and took the knife in his left. Then, before he could reconsider, he ran toward Trish, took aim, and rammed the point of the screwdriver into her left eye, shoving the metal deep into her brain, all the way up to the handle.</p><p>He heard Sam gasp and saw Walter’s eyes widen with shock.</p><p>Trish didn’t react at all. Instead of blood, clear liquid trickled around the screwdriver protruding from her socket. She remained like that for several moments, crouching on all fours atop her father’s bed, expressionless, wounded eye leaking liquid, her mouth still dripping with Walter’s blood. Then suddenly, as if she was a machine whose power supply had been cut off, she slumped over, rolled off the bed, and thumped to the floor.</p><p>Dean could only stand and stare at Trish’s unmoving body, right hand slick with the clear goo that had spurted from her eye when he’d jammed the screwdriver in. A moment later, he felt Sam move to his side and put his arm around Dean’s shoulders. That simple gesture did more for Dean than any words his brother might have spoken.</p><p>Walter showed no reaction at first, and Dean feared that he’d lost so much blood that he wasn’t fully aware of what had happened. Then he let out a howl of anguish, jumped out of bed, and knelt next to his daughter’s body. He tried to pick her up and cradle her, but he was too weak and only managed to lift her partway before she slipped from his hands and fell back to the floor. A second later, tears streaming down his too-pale face, Walter collapsed beside her.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The brothers tried to revive Walter, but he’d lost too much blood. So they dug two graves in the back yard, beneath a large old oak that Trish had loved, and buried father and daughter, saying what words they could think of over their graves. They did their best to clean up the mess in Walter’s room, then searched the cabin and found the statuette of Anubis down in the basement in one of the drawers of Walter’s desk. After a brief discussion, they left it alone, along with a number of other artifacts Walter had stored in his workshop. When they were finished, they went upstairs, locked the basement door, and waited for their father to come get them.</p><p>It would be the better part of two weeks until John Winchester returned.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You guys were out at the motel during the fire, right?”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean, unsure how to answer the sheriff’s question.</p><p>She smiled. “Nothing personal, but you smell like you’ve been to a week-long bonfire.”</p><p>Dean grimaced. “I’m really getting tired of stinking up the joint wherever we go.”</p><p>The sheriff raised an eyebrow in curiosity. Amanda Kopp—who no doubt had long ago grown tired of hearing jokes about her surname—was in her mid-forties, with short brown hair, minimal makeup, and a thin white-gold wedding band on her ring finger. She was friendly, but projected an air of complete professionalism, the latter undercut somewhat by the Hello Kitty cover on the smartphone sitting on her desk in easy reach of her hand.</p><p>Sam wondered if she was one of those people who was so addicted to her phone that she felt anxious if she was too far away from it.</p><p>“It’s been a long few days,” Sam said, hoping she’d let it go at that.</p><p>“Tell me about it.” She let out a sigh. “I’ve got four people dead from some kind of mysterious wasting disease, in addition to the two from last week, and now to top it off, a whole motel burns down so fast it was like it was hit with goddamned napalm. That’s why I’m sitting on my ass in my office. I’m waiting on a call back from the CDC.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged glances. It was just as they’d figured.</p><p>“We understand how busy you are, Sheriff,” Sam said, “and we really appreciate your taking the time to speak with us again.”</p><p>Although it had only been a couple days since they’d first spoken with Sheriff Kopp, she looked as if she’d aged ten years in that time. The lines on her face were more pronounced, and her eyes were red and sore-looking, much like Sam figured his own did. Unfortunately, Sam was far too used to seeing law officers suffering from stress and lack of sleep, not to mention the frustration of knowing something bad was happening in their town and having no idea what was causing it or how to stop it. Most of the time, he and Dean couldn’t tell the local authorities the truth, no matter how much they might want to. Almost always, in their experience, telling the authorities resulted in one of several increasingly negative scenarios. Best case, they’d think they were crazy and stop cooperating with them. Or they’d decide they needed to be held in custody for a psychiatric evaluation. In the worst case, the authorities would believe Sam and Dean, because then they would want to help, and that would put them face to face with dangers that they were in no way trained to deal with. It had worked out okay a time or two—like with Jody Mills in Sioux Falls—but those were the exceptions to the rule.</p><p>There was a reason why hunters tended to work alone or in pairs. The fewer people that had to risk their lives, and often more than just their lives, against the dark things that lived in the world’s shadows, the better. He thought of Trish Hansen. If he and Dean hadn’t let her talk them into taking her ghost hunting...</p><p>Dean frowned. “Wait a minute. Did you say there <em>were four</em> disease victims this week? I thought there were only three.”</p><p>“There were. Until Harrison Brauer turned up dead. He’s a local mortician, and he was due to meet with the wife of one of his... clients. Is that the right word? Anyway, when she got there the door was open, but she couldn’t find anyone, so she started calling Brauer’s name and wandering around his place, looking for him. Eventually, she wandered downstairs into his embalming room, and that’s where she found him, looking like all the others.”</p><p>Sam gave Dean a nod to say, <em>Nice catch.</em> As fuzzy-headed as he was, the detail had slipped right by him. Sam hadn’t considered that Dippel might have been using a mortician as his Igor, especially as it was unlikely the man would have the necessary medical background, but he supposed it was possible. If so, the mortician’s death could mean that Dippel was closing up shop in Brennan and preparing to move on. For all they knew, he might already have left town, in which case they’d have a hell of a time locating him. Sam doubted Dean would have the patience to even try. With Dippel gone, Dean would want to return to figuring out a way to take down Dick Roman.</p><p>Dean’s thoughts must have been running along similar lines, for he gave Sam a look that said, <em>Why are we wasting our time here?</em></p><p>“Sorry I didn’t call you guys,” the sheriff said. “Between trying to get hold of the CDC and dealing with the fire, I’ve had my hands full.”</p><p>“No problem,” Dean said. Sam thought he was going to tell the sheriff thanks, but they no longer needed her help. Instead he took a deep breath, and said, “But if you could answer just a few more questions for us...”</p><p>“Sure thing. It’s not like I’m doing anything at the moment besides sitting here waiting for my phone to ring.”</p><p>Sam wondered which she’d used. Her office phone or her smartphone. Maybe the latter, if for no other reason than to make sure no one else in the department could pick up their extension and listen in. If she believed she was dealing with some sort of contagion, the last thing she would want to do was cause a panic, especially among her own people.</p><p>“We’re exploring the possibility that someone with a medical background might be involved in these deaths,” Dean said.</p><p>Sheriff Kopp’s eyes widened. “You mean, someone did this on purpose? Like, some kind of <em>terrorist?</em> You think I should contact Homeland Security?”</p><p>“We’re just trying to cover all the bases,” Dean said. “At this juncture, we don’t have any evidence that would indicate terrorism. If we did, we’d be sure to tell you.”</p><p>The sheriff looked skeptical at the idea that federal agents would place a high priority on keeping a local like her in the loop, but she just said, “So what do you want to know?”</p><p>“Have there been any problems involving doctors or nurses in the area?” Sam asked. “Maybe even a nurse practitioner, a physician’s assistant, or a paramedic?”</p><p>“Problems?”</p><p>“Patient complaints,” Dean said. “Legal trouble. Strange behavior. Anything out of the ordinary.”</p><p>“You mean like a scandal?” she asked.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be anything that major,” Sam said. “It could be something small, something that no one would think too much about in ordinary circumstances.”</p><p>She considered for a moment. “I’m sorry, but nothing’s coming to mind. Up until the last couple weeks, Brennan’s been a pretty quiet town. Usually, all we ever have to deal with is petty crime, marital disputes, and traffic violations.” She paused, and from the expression on her face, Sam knew she’d thought of something. “This might not be anything, but a few months back we had a father and daughter killed by a drunk driver. The girl was only fifteen, and just starting to learn how to drive. It was a damned shame. Anyway, the mother wasn’t with them when it happened, but she’s a doctor here in town. After the accident, she became depressed. Who wouldn’t, right? She started seeing fewer and fewer patients, until she finally stopped altogether. As far as I know, she hasn’t officially closed down her practice, but she might as well have.”</p><p>A grieving widow and mother who was also a doctor? Dippel would find her an irresistible candidate for an Igor. Not only did she have the knowledge of twenty-first century medicine he needed, but she had a compelling reason to want to work with him. Two reasons, in fact. Her husband and daughter. Sam thought of Walter Hansen, and he knew that if a grief-stricken parent had the opportunity to restore a dead child to life, he or she would be unable to resist taking it, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>Dean must have been thinking the same thing, for he gave Sam a quick nod before turning his attention back to Sheriff Kopp.</p><p>“We need the doctor’s name and address.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Catherine gave Marshall’s body a final check. The tongue looked good—the NuFlesh had done its work, bonding the organ into place almost as easily as gluing two pieces of paper together—as did the new teeth. A couple of them weren’t as straight as she’d like, but she told herself not to be overly critical. Besides, human beings weren’t meant to be perfectly symmetrical. It was the imperfections, slight as they might be, that gave a man or woman character.</p><p>While she continued her examination, checking the spots where Marshall’s limbs—both original and new—had been fused, Conrad busied himself setting up the resurrection equipment. The procedure was primarily a chemical one, and the cart that Conrad wheeled over to the table where Marshall lay contained what at first glance appeared to be a simple arrangement of IV bottles, plastic tubing, and needles hanging from a metal framework. Chemicals of various colors filled the bottles, with tiny glints of illumination that resembled glowing flecks of multicolored metal floating within. Catherine had once asked Conrad what those flecks were, but he’d only given her a thin-lipped smile and said, “It’s an ancient secret.” At first she’d thought he was making a joke, but after everything she’d seen since starting to work with him, she’d come to accept that he was telling her the truth. An ancient secret, and no doubt one as dark as pitch, but she didn’t care, not as long as it returned her husband to her. There were enough chemicals in the bottles to treat both Marshall and Bekah today—assuming all went well with Marshall’s resurrection, that was.</p><p>Catherine knew the formulae for Conrad’s chemical mixtures, save for that one ingredient. Perhaps if she had a stronger background in chemistry, she might recognize the flecks, but she doubted it. Whatever they were, she didn’t think they were the sort of thing you could simply order from a chemical supply company.</p><p>Conrad wheeled a second cart over to Marshall that contained an external automated defibrillator—<em>Much more convenient than waiting for lightning to strike,</em> he’d once told her—along with strips of cloth that had been chemically treated and coated with more of those mysterious flecks of metal. She knew from their previous experiments that Conrad would wrap the strips around Marshall’s chest, leaving a section bare so the defibrillator’s electrodes could make contact with his skin. His head would be wrapped in the cloth, too, down to the neck. The one new element in the procedure this time was Conrad’s stone, the so-called Lapis Occultus. She had no idea what it was and would have dismissed it as pure nonsense if she hadn’t held it in her hand and felt its power for herself. The stone, he had explained to her, would be placed on Marshall’s forehead before the procedure got underway. When she’d asked Conrad what the stone’s purpose was, he’d been even more vague than usual: <em>It’s to ensure that death is held at bay indefinitely.</em></p><p>She’d long ago given up doubting Conrad’s claims. She’d seen too much, accomplished too much with him. If he said the stone would provide some kind of protection against death, then she believed him.</p><p>Satisfied that Marshall’s body was ready for the procedure, Catherine double-checked the IV bottles, tubing, and needles. Conrad had no ego when it came to his work. He insisted that Catherine check everything he did to make sure all was in order. The only thing that mattered to him was obtaining his desired outcome. He didn’t care who made a mistake, he only cared about finding and fixing it. In another person, she would have found the quality admirable, but in Conrad, she knew it arose from a single-minded obsession with success at all costs, including the sublimation of his own ego. Why he was so hell-bent on success, she wasn’t certain, but she sensed his motivation was more than merely intellectual, and it sure as hell wasn’t altruistic. He was working toward something, and had been for a long time, and helping her restore her husband and daughter to life was only one more step toward achieving his ultimate goal. She’d never asked him what that goal was, and truthfully, she didn’t care, not as long as she got Marshall and Bekah back.</p><p>Once she’d determined the chemicals and IVs were in order, she double-checked the defibrillator while Conrad examined Marshall to make sure she hadn’t missed anything. The defibrillator’s battery was fully charged, and it seemed to be in perfect working condition. When their examinations were complete, Conrad looked at her.</p><p>“Shall we finish?” he asked.</p><p>She nodded and together they wrapped the treated cloth strips around Marshall’s head and chest, Conrad lifting his body as needed while Catherine wrapped. The cloth needed to be put on immediately before the procedure, because—for reasons she didn’t understand—the chemicals it had been treated with lost their efficacy the longer they were in contact with the skin. They’d only used half the strips by the time they were finished. The other half were for Bekah. They checked to make sure Marshall was wrapped tight, and then Conrad took the Lapis Occultus from the cart and gently, almost reverently, placed it on Marshall’s forehead.</p><p>He stepped back and cocked his head as he regarded the stone’s placement. Catherine couldn’t see what earthly difference the position of the object made, but Conrad must have, for he reached out, made a small adjustment, then nodded to himself.</p><p>“I believe we are ready to begin inserting the—“</p><p><em>Needles,</em> Catherine knew he’d been about to say, but he broke off, a look of astonishment on his face. He raised his hand with the X on it and stared at the mark as if he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The X looked the same to her, but whatever had changed about it had alarmed the usually unflappable Mr. Dippel.</p><p>“We need to hurry,” he said, tension in his voice. “They’re coming.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Two men. Hunters... Killers. They want to stop us. I thought I’d dealt with them...” He curled his hand into a fist. “...but evidently I was mistaken.”</p><p>Catherine’s head was swimming. “What are they? Police? Hit men? Secret agents, for god’s sake?”</p><p>“I don’t have time to explain fully. Suffice it to say that they will break into your home, come down here, and not only stop what we’re doing, but destroy Marshall and Bekah’s bodies to ensure they will never rise. Is that what you want?”</p><p>Conrad was shouting by the time he reached the end of his words, but it was his emotional intensity more than anything else that convinced Catherine he was speaking the truth.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>“I can try to hold them off, but at this point, I’m not confident in my ability to do so alone. If I had use of the Lapis Occultus... But no, it’s needed here. No matter what else occurs, it is vital that Bekah be restored to life.”</p><p>Just Bekah, she noted. Not Marshall.</p><p>Conrad looked down at Marshall’s body, still lifeless and waiting for resurrection. A cold sly smile spread across his face.</p><p>“If I had your husband’s help...”</p><p>“No! I’m not going to bring Marshall back only to send him into harm’s way. If these men really are as dangerous as you seem to think—“</p><p>“I’ll ask you the same question I asked regarding which of your loved ones was to be resurrected first. Given the situation, what would Marshall do?”</p><p>As before, Catherine didn’t have to think about her reply. “Protect his daughter.”</p><p>Without exchanging another word, they began inserting the IV needles into various points of Marshall’s body.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel raged inside the confines of the Lapis Occultus. To his perceptions, it seemed as if he was floating disembodied within an endless expanse of darkness, and that he’d been there for a very, very long time. Another being might well have gone insane in the same circumstances, but Daniel was a Reaper. Darkness, no matter how vast or unending, didn’t scare him. It did, however, seriously piss him off.</p><p>He couldn’t believe he’d allowed himself to be captured by Dippel. It hadn’t occurred to him that the alchemist might have conceived of a way to harness the energy of a Reaper and use it in his obscene experiments. That was something Daniel needed to prevent at any cost. The question was, how? He’d tried translocating, a common ability for his kind. Normally, he could move from one location to another simply by willing it, but no matter how hard he concentrated, no matter how much power he summoned, he was unable to break free of the darkness. He’d tried reaching out to any other Reapers that might be in the vicinity. Considering how many deaths had taken place in Brennan lately, there were bound to be a few around. Yet although he strained to stretch his thoughts outward, he was unable to penetrate his prison’s walls. That left him with only one option—the last option, as far as any Reaper was concerned—calling the boss.</p><p>Death was a strong believer in delegating. When he assigned a task to one of his servants, he expected it to be carried out, and if any problems arose, he expected them to be dealt with. What he did <em>not</em> want was to be bothered every time some little thing went wrong. Whenever Death was disturbed for something trivial—and given what he was, almost everything was trivial to him—he was not slow to express his displeasure. But Daniel didn’t see any other choice left to him. If Dippel succeeded in incarnating Hel, as bad as it would be for the humans on Earth, it would be far worse for him. Death would make certain of it.</p><p>Daniel had no eyes to close in his black prison, but he imagined himself performing the action anyway. He concentrated and called out to Death—</p><p>—and received no answer.</p><p>Daniel was shocked. There was no place in existence that Death couldn’t reach. All worlds, all times, all dimensions were part of his inconceivably vast domain. Yet Death hadn’t heard him.</p><p>Whatever this stone was, it had been created by magic far greater than Daniel had anticipated. Perhaps Hel herself had taken a hand in its construction. She was nowhere near as powerful as Death, but as a goddess of death (with a lowercase d) her power could easily counter Daniel’s.</p><p>He was on his own, trapped in a magic artifact, his energy to be used to pave the way for an ancient Norse goddess of death to enter the world of the living. There was nothing he could do but wait and hope the Winchesters found a way to succeed where he had failed. Which didn’t do anything to improve his mood.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean drove past Catherine Luss’s house, then pulled the car off the side of the road onto the shoulder. Catherine lived out in the country. There were no sidewalks, and he didn’t want to park in her driveway. The last thing the brothers wanted to do was announce their presence. Dean turned off the engine.</p><p>Then he looked at Sam. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I-don’t-know-what-you-mean,” Sam answered quickly, speaking so fast his words ran together.</p><p>“Yeah, you do. Ever since we stopped at that gas station so you could hit the head and get rid of all that coffee you’ve been drinking, you’ve been suspiciously wide awake and full of energy.”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>Dean noted his brother’s bouncing leg and tapping fingers.</p><p>“Maybe-the-caffeine-finally-kicked-in,” Sam offered in his too-rapid voice.</p><p><em>“Something</em> kicked in,” Dean said, “but it sure as hell isn’t caffeine. What did you do? Steal some pick-me-up pills from the med kit?”</p><p>Hunters tended to get banged up pretty good on the job, and even if there was a hospital in the area, they preferred to patch their own wounds whenever possible. Fewer questions that way. So every hunter had a fully stocked medical kit with its own mini-pharmacy. Dean figured that while he’d been busy buying some snacks—extra-hot jalapeno tortilla chips and crème-filled chocolate snack cakes—Sam had grabbed some stimulants from the kit and taken them in the restroom.</p><p>At first Sam looked as if he intended to deny it, but then he sighed.</p><p>“You know the weird black veiny marks on my leg? They’ve spread.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like where this was going. “How far?”</p><p>“Basically, my whole leg is covered now. I can still walk, but it’s numb all over. If there’s any chance of fixing whatever’s wrong with me, it lies with Dippel. I can’t afford to sit this one out, Dean. Not if I want to survive.”</p><p>“I could—“</p><p>“And I’m <em>not</em> letting you face the real-world equivalent of Dr. Frankenstein on your own.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like it. In fact, it pissed him off something fierce. It didn’t help that he knew he would have done the same thing if their situations had been reversed.</p><p>“How large a dose did you take?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Large enough. Let’s go before it starts wearing off.”</p><p>Sam got out of the car before Dean could say anything else. He sat there for a moment, struggling to deal with his anger.</p><p>“Sam, if you die because of this, I’m going to force Dippel to teach me how to resurrect the dead, and then I’m going to bring you back so I can kill you myself!”</p><p>He let out a long sigh of frustration and got out of the car. Sam already had the car’s trunk open and was gearing up. Dean joined him, nose wrinkling at the stink of their plastic-bagged clothes. Was there any substance on the planet that could contain the Frankenstench?</p><p>They selected the same weapons they’d carried during the hunt for the Double-Header. Dean armed himself with his Colt and the Winchester shotgun, and Sam chose his Beretta and the sawed-off double barrel. They each took a pair of KA-BAR knives and some flares. They hadn’t had a chance to use the latter against the Double-Header, but they could still come in handy. This time, they brought something new, one of their standard pieces of equipment that they rarely got to use: a homemade flamethrower constructed from a container of kerosene, various lengths of pipe, and a control button to regulate the release of fuel. It was capable of producing a flame about fifteen feet long, but the kerosene wouldn’t last forever, so you had to make sure every blast counted.</p><p>Sam started to speak, but Dean cut him off.</p><p>“Given your condition, there’s no way I’m letting you use this thing, so don’t even ask.”</p><p>Sam scowled, but he didn’t protest.</p><p>Dean slipped the flamethrower’s straps over his shoulders, then stood for a moment to get a feel for the weight. Carrying the flamethrower always made him feel as if he had a bomb on his back that was ready to go off at any time. <em>Fun, fun, fun!</em></p><p>“Once more into the breach, eh?” Dean said.</p><p>“Unto,” Sam said. “The correct quote is ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.’ It’s from Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V.”</em></p><p>Dean sighed. He should’ve known better that to try and get literary on Sam.</p><p>“How about this? Let’s go kick some Frankenass.”</p><p>“That’ll work,” Sam said with a smile, and together they headed for the house.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Catherine had attached the electrodes of the automated external defibrillator to Marshall’s chest. Normally the sensors in the electrodes sent data to the AED’s computer, which would determine whether someone was experiencing sudden cardiac arrest and required an electric shock. The computer would then use voice prompts to guide whoever was using the device, but Catherine had deactivated that function, as it was for people without medical training. Besides, at the moment Marshall had no heartbeat, and therefore there was no data for the computer to pick up. In a normal situation, this would mean the device wouldn’t deliver a charge, but she’d paid a local computer repairman a sizeable sum to bypass those safety features for her, and to keep his mouth shut about it. This AED was one of the early models and was capable of delivering a shock of up to four hundred joules. More recent models gave two sequential shocks of only one-twenty to two hundred joules, as that was now considered safer for the patient, but Catherine didn’t need safe. She needed a strong enough charge to, as Conrad had put it, “galvanize the chemical admixture.” Four hundred joules had been sufficient to do that for the dog. She prayed it would be enough for Marshall.</p><p>“I believe the moment is at hand,” Conrad said. He stood by the cart containing the IV bottles, monitoring the amount of chemicals that had passed into Marshall’s body.</p><p>Catherine nodded. She had gone through this procedure a number of times, first with rats and then with the dog. The rats hadn’t lasted long, decaying in less than a day. The dog had been more successful, but it too had succumbed to tissue degradation in the end. She hoped that Conrad’s magic stone would make the difference, but there was only one way to find out.</p><p>Each time she’d gone through this, she was amazed at how unremarkable it all was. No Van de Graaff generators crackling with electricity, no crazed hunchbacked assistant’s mad cackling, no spooky gothic music swelling in the background, just a few chemicals quietly entering the bloodstream and then a single button to push. Bringing the dead back to life should be a spectacular, monumental moment. Instead, it was no more dramatic than any other medical procedure. Of course, the results were a different story.</p><p>She stepped over to the defibrillator, said, “Clear,” more as a precaution than from any real worry that Conrad might be in physical contact with Marshall’s body, and pushed the button.</p><p>Marshall’s muscles tightened and his spine arced as electricity coursed through his body. She’d inserted a plastic mouth guard between his teeth to make sure he didn’t bite his new tongue. After all the work she’d put in to attaching the organ, she didn’t want anything to happen to it. The Lapis Occultus was dislodged from his forehead, but before it could tumble to the floor, Conrad’s hand shot out and snatched it from the air, moving with inhuman speed. As far as she could see, the stone hadn’t done anything special, but Conrad held it close to his eyes, examined it, then nodded as if satisfied.</p><p>Once the charge had been delivered, Marshall’s body collapsed back onto the table and lay still once more. Catherine knew that what she had witnessed was a reflex action, not any sign of life, but she still couldn’t help being encouraged. Just to see him move again after all these months, even if it was just a reflex, filled her heart with joy.</p><p>“Check the defibrillator’s battery,” Conrad said. “We need to make sure there’s enough charge remaining for Bekah.”</p><p>Catherine didn’t want to take her eyes off Marshall, but she did as Conrad said. If he was right about the two men who were coming, they didn’t have any time to waste. She checked the readout and saw there was enough power remaining for at least one more charge, maybe two.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she said.</p><p>She turned back just in time to hear Marshall draw in a gasping breath of air, his first in months.</p><p>“Remove the bandages!” Conrad said.</p><p>They each grabbed a pair of surgical scissors and began cutting the cloth strips away from Marshall, Conrad cutting those around his chest, Catherine those around his head. When the bandages fell away from his face, she saw that his eyes were open and looking up at her. She had been afraid she would see the same glassy expression that the dog’s eyes had held—dead eyes with no hint of life or recognition in them—but his eyes were alive and intelligence shone in them. He mumbled something, trying to speak around the mouth guard. She gently removed it, and Marshall said, “Caff... rinn?”</p><p>His voice was a deep phlegmy rumble, unlike his normal tenor, and his mouth couldn’t form the syllables quite right, the sounds too soft and mushy, but it was Marshall speaking. The first word he’d said had been her name.</p><p>She felt tears trickling down her face and realized she was crying. “Yes, sweetheart. It’s me.” She took his hand and gave it a squeeze. At first his hand remained limp, and she feared something was wrong, but then he squeezed back, his grip strong—even stronger than she remembered.</p><p>“I’m genuinely sorry I have to do this. I’d prefer to give the two of you more time to enjoy your reunion, but as the British say, ‘Needs must when the devil drives.’”</p><p>She looked at Conrad in time to see him hold a small envelope over Marshall’s mouth. Yellowish powder drifted out and floated down to cover his face in a light coating. Without thinking, she lashed out and smacked the envelope out of Conrad’s hand, but it was too late. Whatever he’d intended to do was done.</p><p>Though Conrad’s eyes flashed with anger at having been struck by her, his voice was icily calm as he spoke. “His mind will most likely be confused during the post-regeneration period, and even if he was at his peak mentally, it would take too long to explain the current situation to him. The powder I used will make him obey me without question. I assure you the effect is only temporary.”</p><p>Catherine didn’t like it, not one bit. She especially didn’t like Conrad’s use of the word obey, as if he were the master and Marshall nothing more than his slave. She forced herself to think practically instead of emotionally, though. It had taken the dog almost a full day to recover from the effects of being reborn. During that time, it had slept, mostly. Perhaps Marshall would recover more swiftly, especially since they’d used the Lapis Occultus with him, but they couldn’t afford to wait and find out.</p><p>“Very well,” she said. “But I expect you to make sure he’s as safe as possible.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Of course. Take heart. If he <em>is</em> damaged, we’ll just repair him.”</p><p>He looked at Marshall, and his smile fell away. He removed the defibrillator’s electrodes from his chest and handed them to Catherine.</p><p>“Get off the table.”</p><p>Marshall did as Conrad commanded, not bothering to wipe the residue of yellow powder from his face. His movements were stiff and uncoordinated, but Catherine knew from previous experiments that he’d soon adjust to his new body. She hoped it would be soon enough to help him fight off the two killers Conrad assured her were coming. She did wish there was time to put some clothes on him, though. She didn’t like the idea of sending him out to fight naked, but there was nothing to be done about it now.</p><p><em>Maybe it won’t matter to him,</em> she thought. <em>Maybe he is like a newborn child, innocent and without shame.</em></p><p>“Stand over there.” Conrad pointed to the basement steps. After a second’s hesitation, Marshall lurched over to the steps and stood there, a blank expression on his face.</p><p>Catherine couldn’t stand seeing him look like that. She hadn’t brought her husband back to life to become a mindless automaton.</p><p>Before she could protest, Conrad said, “Quickly. We must make Bekah ready. I fear you’ll have to perform the procedure by yourself, my dear, but I believe you’re more than capable.”</p><p>Catherine wasn’t certain about that, but if it was a choice between bringing Bekah back by herself or watching as her daughter’s body was destroyed by these so-called hunters, then it was really no choice at all.</p><p>“Let’s get her on the table,” she said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam wasn’t sure taking the stimulants had been a good idea. His heart was racing, and his skin was slick with sweat. Worse, his pulse felt erratic, black spots danced in his vision, and he couldn’t feel his right leg at all. It wasn’t even numb; it just felt like it wasn’t there. He had to concentrate extra hard with every step he took to make sure he didn’t fall over. The hell of it was, he <em>still</em> felt tired. Not sleepy-tired, but physically exhausted, as if his body was on the verge of collapse. To make matters even worse, he’d started hallucinating. Nothing major yet, just ghostly half-images of strange shapes he couldn’t identify, but he knew from experience that the hallucinations would soon intensify, and when that happened, he wouldn’t be able to tell what was real from what wasn’t. Which would be liable to get both him and his brother killed.</p><p><em>Come on, Sam,</em> he told himself. <em>Just try to hold it together a little longer...</em></p><p>One benefit of the Luss residence being located outside town was that there were no nearby neighbors to call the police and report a pair of armed men sneaking around to the back of the house. One disadvantage was the amount of trees in the Luss’s yard, or rather, all the leaves that had fallen from them. It seemed Dr. Luss had been too busy playing mad scientist to do any yard work, and her property was covered with brown, yellow, red and—above all—<em>crunchy</em> leaves. Sam and Dean had to move carefully to make sure they didn’t make too much noise, but a certain amount was unavoidable. They’d have to hope that whoever was inside was either too busy to pay attention to any sounds outside, or if they did hear some leaves crunch, would put it down to squirrels or deer. It was dusk, and the fading light would help to conceal them somewhat, but not as much as if it was full night. They’d debated waiting until dark to approach the house, but given the fact that Dippel might be preparing to leave town as soon as possible, they’d decided they couldn’t afford to. They would have to rely on a hunter’s two best friends: surprise and one hell of a lot of luck.</p><p>Sam began shivering, but although the air was chilly, he knew the cold came from inside. If he could examine himself unclothed in front of a full-length mirror right now, how far would he see the infection had spread? Onto his stomach? Maybe up to his chest? How much longer did he have until the dark taint inside him had spread to the point where his body could no longer function? He had no idea, but if he was going to be taking an eternal dirt nap after this hunt, he at least wanted to see it through to the end. He owed Dean far more than that, more than he could ever repay, but it would have to be good enough, for it might be all he had left.</p><p>The Luss family had a deck at the rear of their house, with a picnic table on one end and a gas grill set next to a patio door. Sam wondered when the last time was that all three of them—Catherine, her husband, and her daughter—had sat out there and had a meal, talking, laughing, enjoying being in one another’s presence. What had it been like for Catherine to come home to an empty house after a long day of seeing patients? Had she looked through the patio window at the picnic table, maybe even stepped outside and sat down at it for a few minutes, crying and remembering? No wonder Conrad Dippel had chosen her to be his ultimate Igor. With the sorrow she carried, she would have been ripe for his psychological manipulation.</p><p>The brothers walked side by side, close enough that when Dean whispered, Sam had no trouble hearing him. “I’ll go in through the patio door. You stay outside in case anyone tries to get away.”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Sam whispered back. “I’m perfectly capable of going in with you, and since we don’t know if there are any more Frankenmutts or Double-Header juniors in there, you’re going to need back-up.”</p><p>Dean didn’t look happy about it. “Fine. But you’re not in the best shape right now, and you know it. So if—“</p><p>Dean was cut off by the sound of shattering glass as a naked man crashed through the patio door. Glass shards scattered across the deck, and blood from fresh cuts on the man’s hands and forearms pattered to the wood in thick droplets.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. “He might be naked, but at least he doesn’t have any extra body parts.”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>Dippel, dressed formally in a gray suit and tie, stepped through the opening in the patio door and onto the deck.</p><p>“My apologies,” he said, his voice carrying a hint of a German accent. “It appears Mr. Luss hasn’t yet remembered the proper way to open a patio door.”</p><p>“The naked guy is the doctor’s husband,” Sam said.</p><p>“And it looks like we managed to get here before Dippel skipped town,” Dean replied.</p><p>Luss stood on the deck, looking at them without expression. He seemed more like a classic voodoo zombie—the kind that was resurrected to serve as a mindless servant of a houngan—than a Frankensteinian creation. Then again, as Sam looked closer, he could see the scar lines where NuFlesh had been used to attach various body parts together, and although they were close matches, they weren’t exact. The right leg was slightly longer than the other and had more body hair, while the left arm was thinner than the right, its skin a shade or two darker. As Sam watched, dark energy gathered around Luss’s arms, just as he had seen with the Double-Header.</p><p>“Do you see that?” he asked Dean.</p><p>“See what? The guy’s Frankendork hanging out? And by the way, if his wife put him back together, you’d think she’d have given him a little extra in that department, you know what I mean?” Dean looked toward the resurrected Mr. Luss. “Nothing personal!” he called out.</p><p>“He’s got the same ability to drain life force that the Double-Header had,” Sam said.</p><p>“Death vision?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“All right. Important safety tip. Thanks.” Dean took a step forward and addressed Dippel. “You see we’re armed, right? So before any of us goes and does something stupid, let’s talk.”</p><p>Sam glanced sideways at his brother. <em>What are you up to?</em> he thought.</p><p>Dippel smiled. “What is it you Americans say? We don’t negotiate with terrorists.” He turned to Marshall Luss. “Kill them.”</p><p>The man started toward them, ignoring the glass shards on the deck. He cut his feet and left bloody footprints in his wake, but the injuries didn’t seem to cause him any more pain than the cuts on his hands and arms did.</p><p>Dean cradled his shotgun in his elbow, grabbed a flare from his jacket pocket, pulled off the striking cap, and lit it. A shower of reddish sparks burst forth from the flare’s tip. Dean dropped the striking cap and, still cradling his shotgun, held the burning flare out before him and started walking toward the deck.</p><p>Marshall stopped at the edge of the deck, blood pooling beneath his shredded feet and dripping from his hands. The dark energy that had been building around his hands faded and was gone. An expression crossed his face at last. It was one of fear.</p><p>“Fire bad,” Dean said.</p><p>“Indeed,” Dippel commented dryly. “I would think it doubly true in your case, considering you carry a container of flammable liquid on your back.”</p><p>“What can I say? I’m just a guy who likes living on the edge.”</p><p>Dippel regarded Dean for a moment, sizing him up, Sam thought, trying to determine how dangerous he was. Evidently, dangerous enough, for Dippel said, “What did you want to talk about?”</p><p>“My brother got bit by your dog, and he picked up some kind of Frankenrabies. You’re going to cure him.”</p><p>Dippel arced an eyebrow. “Is this so? And why, pray tell, would I do something so clearly against my own interests?”</p><p>“Because if you do, we’ll let you go.”</p><p>Sam couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Are you nuts?”</p><p>Dean ignored him. “And there’s one other thing.”</p><p>Dippel laughed. “You’re a bold one, aren’t you? Very well, what is it?”</p><p>“We need a weapon.”</p><p>Sam didn’t like where this was heading. “Dean, we can’t do this. We’ve both made deals we shouldn’t have, with forces we shouldn’t have, and it’s never turned out well.”</p><p>Dean kept his gaze focused on Dippel. “You ever heard of the Leviathan?”</p><p>Dippel’s eyes narrowed. “I’ve encountered some lore about them in my time.”</p><p>“Well, they’re real and they’re loose on Earth. My brother and I are determined to stop them before they turn the planet into their personal all-you-can-eat buffet, but to do that, we’re going to need some serious firepower. Something like that fire lizard you sicced on us back at the motel.”</p><p>“So if I cure your brother and give you a weapon, you’ll simply allow me to depart Brennan—<em>and you</em> won’t attempt to hunt me down later?”</p><p>“Oh, we’ll come after you eventually,” Dean said. “Assuming the Leviathan don’t make a meal out of us. But that’s down the road. What we’re talking about now is what it’s going to take for you to live long enough to get out of town.”</p><p>“I must admit, it’s an intriguing offer.”</p><p>Dippel looked as if he might be considering it, but Marshall’s fear of the flare seemed to be fading. He stepped closer to the edge of the deck, and the black energy began to swirl around his arms once again. He no longer looked afraid. He looked angry.</p><p><em>This,</em> Sam thought, <em>is bullshit.</em></p><p>He shifted his sawed-off shotgun to his left hand, drew his Beretta, took aim at Marshall Luss, and fired.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Catherine stood next to the defibrillator, finger poised above the activation button. Bekah’s head and chest were wrapped tight in the treated cloth strips, and the rest of her body appeared whole and unmarred. The IV needles had been inserted at various junctures and had delivered the chemicals into her vascular system, and the AED’s sensors had been attached, one to her upper chest, one to her lower. Her flesh showed no sign of decay, and the NuFlesh scars were less noticeable on her than on Marshall. Catherine knew it was sexist of her, but she’d taken more care with Bekah than Marshall because she thought the scarring issue would matter more to a young woman than it would to a middle-aged man. She didn’t think Marshall would mind.</p><p>She jumped when she heard the distant sound of shattering glass.</p><p><em>It’s started.</em></p><p>She knew she should activate the defibrillator, but she hesitated. Had she administered the IV chemicals in the right dosages? Properly positioned the Lapis Occultus on Bekah’s forehead? She’d told Conrad that enough battery power remained to operate the AED, but what if she’d miscalculated? What if she had made a mistake somewhere along the line? The smallest error could negatively affect the outcome, and if the procedure didn’t work, if Bekah didn’t return to life, Catherine feared she might not get another chance. It wouldn’t matter if Marshall and Conrad defeated the hunters, not if Bekah’s body was so damaged due to her bungling that it couldn’t be salvaged. Bekah would die a second death before she could be reborn, and after that, resurrection would no longer be possible.</p><p>Catherine felt the temperature in the basement drop, as if the central air had been turned on and the thermostat set to “cold as ice.” Shadows gathered from every corner of the room, sliding across the floor toward her like sinuous black serpents. She watched with a mixture of awe and dread as the shadows merged to form a swirling whirlpool of darkness. A moment later a figure rose from the ebon mass, a woman with marble-white skin who wore the shadows around her like a cloak of night. Her eyes were solid obsidian, and her lips the bright red of arterial spray. She was the most beautiful being, male or female, that Catherine had ever seen.</p><p>The woman’s mouth didn’t move, but Catherine heard her speak nonetheless.</p><p><em>Fear not, my daughter. Your work has been exemplary. This body is both comely and strong, and with the aid of the Lapis Occultus, it shall contain the whole of my power without ill effect. It will be the perfect vessel. All you need do is release the tiny lightning, and your daughter will not only draw breath again, she shall truly be reborn, becoming something far more than you ever dreamed possible.</em></p><p>The voice was cold but hypnotic, a winter wind whispering across a snow-covered plain in the dead of night. Catherine felt compelled to obey, and if she noted the woman’s use of the word vessel, it did not trouble her. She smiled as she gazed into the limitless dark depths of the woman’s eyes, and she pressed the defibrillator’s button.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean saw blood mist from Marshall Luss’s right shoulder the same instant he heard the crack of Sam’s Beretta going off. He didn’t know what he was angrier about, that Sam had shot before he could negotiate a deal with Dippel, or that he’d missed doing any real damage to Marshall.</p><p><em>His aim’s off because he’s so sick,</em> Dean thought. <em>Hell, he’s probably lucky he still has the strength to hold the damned gun and squeeze the trigger.</em> Taking all that into consideration, he supposed it wasn’t that bad of a shot after all. Still, it pissed him off, and it didn’t leave him much choice about what to do next.</p><p>He hurled the flare toward Marshall, and before it could strike him, he switched the Winchester into a firing position and let ‘er rip.</p><p>Marshall brought up his hands to shield his face and took a step back as the burning flare tumbled toward him. His feet were still slick with blood, and that’s what saved his life—or unlife, as the case might be. His feet slid out from under him and he fell backward just as Dean fired his shotgun. Marshall slammed to the deck, glass shards lodging in his back. The flare hit the deck, bounced a couple times, then rolled to a stop six feet from him. The wood beneath the blazing tip blackened and began to burn. Marshall jumped to his feet and pointed at the flare.</p><p>“Fy-uh!” he shouted. “Fy-uh!”</p><p>He sounded like a four-year-old, maybe younger. Hearing a child’s halting attempt at language come out of a grown man’s mouth filled Dean with both pity and rage. As much as he hated monsters, he viewed most of them as not much different than animals. They did what they did because it was their nature, but because they preyed on humans who didn’t believe in them and had no idea how to defend themselves, hunters like him and Sam—and Bobby and their dad—had to kill them. Demons were a different story, of course, and don’t get him started on friggin’ angels! But the poor reanimated son of a bitch that was Marshall Luss hadn’t asked to become an undead <em>thing,</em> and he’d still be resting in peace if it wasn’t for Conrad “Just call me the mad alchemist” Dippel. He was the real monster.</p><p>“You know, Sam, it’s been a while since we had ourselves a good old-fashioned barbecue.”</p><p>He dropped the Winchester to the ground, took hold of the flamethrower’s nozzle, and started running toward the deck. Although the fire stream had a fifteen-foot range, he wanted to get good and close before unleashing hell so he could make every lick of flame count. He could hear kerosene slosh as he ran, and he couldn’t wait to empty the whole damned container on Dippel.</p><p>Dippel looked less than impressed by Dean’s charge. He reached into a pocket of his pants, pulled out a fistful of powder, and tossed it at the flare, barking a few harsh words in what Dean supposed was German as he did so. The powder transformed into water in midair and splashed down onto the flare, dousing both it and the flames around it.</p><p>Dippel turned to face Dean, reaching into his pocket for more powder.</p><p>Dean came to a halt three yards from Dippel, raised the flamethrower’s nozzle, and thumbed the switch.</p><p>“Flame on!” he shouted.</p><p>A stream of fire shot from the flamethrower’s nozzle and arced toward Dippel just as the alchemist hurled the rain powder and shouted more German. But Dean wasn’t aiming directly at Dippel. Instead, he aimed at the deck around Dippel’s feet, stepping to the side as he fired to avoid the powder—now water—coming at him. Flaming liquid splashed onto the deck, causing Marshall to shriek in terror and leap into the yard to get away from the “Fy-uh.” Dean would deal with him later. Right now his primary objective was to cook himself up a little Southern fried Dippel.</p><p>He’d forgotten the powder-turned-water was magical in origin, however, and instead of splashing harmlessly to the ground, it changed trajectory in midair and curved toward the flamethrower’s nozzle. Before Dean could react, it struck the nozzle and flowed into it, the water moving as if it was alive. The fire cut off at once, and although Dean thumbed the release button several times, all that came out were thin streams of decidedly not-flaming liquid. The flames he’d already ignited on the deck were spreading, but none had reached Dippel yet, and the alchemist was hard at work using more of his magic water-powder to douse the fire.</p><p><em>Some Human Torch you turned out to be,</em> Dean thought.</p><p>He caught movement from the corner of his eye and turned just in time to see Marshall Luss running toward him, features contorted into a mask of rage, bloody hands stretched out, fingers curled into fists.</p><p>“Fy-uh bad!” he bellowed. “You bad!”</p><p>“Sam? A little help?”</p><p>No reply. Dean’s gut twisted with a cold, sick feeling, he looked over his shoulder to see Sam lying on the ground, still clutching his Beretta, eyes closed, body still. Dean couldn’t tell if his brother was still breathing, but he couldn’t afford to waste any more time fighting. He needed Dippel’s help.</p><p>Marshall slammed into him with all the ferocity of a pro linebacker. The resurrected man wrapped his arms around Dean as he hit, and the impact carried them both to the ground. Dean tried to twist out of Marshall’s grip on the way down, but the man was strong as hell—probably way stronger than he’d been in life—and he was unable to break free. Dean’s breath was forced out of his lungs as he struck the ground, Marshall still holding tight to him. Under other circumstances, Dean might have found it more than a little awkward to have a naked man lying on top of him, but just then he had bigger concerns. The longer it took him to get Sam help, the greater the chance that his brother would die. His thoughts raced as he desperately tried to think of a way to break the man’s iron grip. Then he felt a familiar draining sensation, as if the life was being sucked out of him. He remembered Sam telling him that Marshall had the same ability to drain life force as Frankenmutt and the Double-Header. If he didn’t get away from Marshall fast, he’d be sucked drier than a juice box on a desert playground at high noon. Dean thrashed and kicked, but nothing he did helped, and he could already feel himself growing weaker. A few more moments, and it would be over. His worst nightmare would have come true. He’d have failed to carry out the charge his father had given him so many years ago: to take care of his younger brother. More than that, he would have failed to kill that slimy land-shark Dick Roman and avenge Bobby’s death.</p><p><em>Looks like I’ll be joining you in the Happy Hunting Ground, you old grump,</em> Dean thought. <em>Hope you got a cold one waiting for me.</em></p><p>He continued struggling, but it was getting harder to move. It would be so much easier to lie back, close his eyes, and allow himself to slip away. No more killing, no more feeling like he carried the whole damn world on his back, like everyone’s lives depended on him not screwing up. In a lot of ways, death would come as a relief. All he had to do was stop fighting...</p><p>“Hold!”</p><p><em>A woman’s voice. No, a teenage girl’s.</em></p><p>Dean immediately felt the draining sensation stop. Marshall released him and rose to his feet. Dean was too weak for the moment to do anything but lie where he was and watch.</p><p>Dippel knelt on the scorched deck, head bowed. A woman Dean presumed was Catherine Luss stood next to him, gazing with adoration upon a brown-haired, barefoot girl dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, both black. On the shirt in white letters: <em>I’m only wearing black until they make something darker.</em> In her right hand, the girl held a dark blue stone.</p><p>She looked at Dean. “My apologies. I would have been here sooner, but I insisted on finding something to wear first. Do you like it?” She twirled around to display her outfit. “To the Norse people, the color black symbolized new beginnings, just as night heralds the birth of day, and winter the birth of summer. I thought it appropriate considering that today is the day of <em>my</em> birth, in a sense.”</p><p><em>Norse?</em> Dean thought. Then he registered the way Dippel was kneeling before her, like she was some kind of...</p><p>He moaned as he struggled to a sitting position. “Don’t tell me we’re dealing with another friggin’ god! I am so sick of you guys! You’re nothing but stuck-up monsters with delusions of grandeur.”</p><p>The girl bristled but maintained her composure. “I am Hel. Just one L. The Vikings worshipped me as the embodiment of death.”</p><p>“Well, the Vikings were dumbasses then, ‘cause I’ve met capital-D Death, lady, and believe me, you aren’t him. But you’re not a teenage girl either, are you? You’re just using the doctor’s daughter as a meat suit. I’ve seen that trick before, too.”</p><p>Dean still felt weak as a half-drowned kitten, but he could feel his strength returning bit by bit. He wanted to keep Hel talking to give himself more time to recover. He glanced at Marshall. The doctor’s Frankenhubby stood staring at Hel, an empty expression on his face. Dean wondered if the man had enough beans left in his <em>cabeza</em> to recognize his daughter, and if so, somewhere inside his mind, was he shouting in anger at what had been done to her? Not that the good lady doctor seemed upset. From the way she was beaming at the goddess, it looked as if she was ready to join the First Church of Hel, get baptized, and run for Pope.</p><p>He glanced at Sam, but saw no change. He still lay there, unconscious or worse. Dean didn’t know if he could work a deal with Hel, but despite Sam’s warning against making pacts with dark powers, he had to try. His brother’s life depended on it.</p><p>He was trying to think up a good sales pitch when Hel turned to Conrad and placed a hand on his head.</p><p>“You may gaze upon me, my most good and loyal servant.”</p><p>She removed her hand and Conrad, trembling, raised his head to look at her. He made no move to stand.</p><p>“My lady. You are more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.” Tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. “To see you incarnated in flesh that will not wither before your dark power is the fulfillment of a dream I have carried for three centuries, ever since the day I first heard your voice as a child in Castle Frankenstein.”</p><p>She smiled lovingly down at him. “I reached out to many others before you, Conrad, but yours were the only ears that heard, the only mind brilliant enough to understand what I needed, and the only heart steadfast enough to find the courage to keep on striving through all the long years. And now, here we are.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady. I will never know a moment finer than this.”</p><p>Hel’s smile turned cold. “This is true.”</p><p>She pointed the stone at him, and a bolt of ebon energy shot forth and struck him in the chest. He stiffened, and his body began to age at a rapid rate, the centuries catching up with him in a second. His flesh wrinkled, became parchment-dry, and drew tight against his bones. His hair became white wisps that drifted away from his liver-spotted scalp and fell, decaying to nothing before they could hit the wooden deck. His eyes sank into his skull and vanished, and his lips pulled back from his teeth, creating a ghastly grin. He fell onto his side, and what remained of his body collapsed into dust. A moment later, that was gone too, and all that remained of Conrad Dippel, the insane alchemist who had inspired one of the most famous horror novels in the English language, along with scores of films, was an empty suit.</p><p>“What did you do that for?” Dean demanded. “Not that I’m sorry to see him go, but it’s a lousy way to repay three hundred years of devotion. The least you could’ve done is given him a gold watch or something.”</p><p>Hel shrugged. “He was a tool I was finished with, so I discarded him. I needed someone to serve as my agent in the physical world, but now that I have a suitable body, I need no one but myself.”</p><p>Hel continued to face him as she spoke, so she didn’t see the look on Catherine Luss’s face, but Dean did. The adoration was gone, replaced by confusion. <em>Mamma can’t wrap her head around what her little girl just did,</em> he thought. If Hel kept going like this, it wouldn’t take long for the spell she’d cast over the doctor to break. Once that happened, she was liable to get zapped by that weird blue stone of Hel’s and end up like Dippel.</p><p>Dean wasn’t close to his full strength again, but he thought he might be strong enough.</p><p>“You know, I was going to try to make a deal with you to save my brother’s life, but I get the feeling you aren’t really the dealing type.”</p><p>“You are correct. If I want something, I take it.” She grinned. “It was one of the reasons the Vikings were so fond of me. They thought like I do.”</p><p>“That’s what I figured. In that case...” Dean drew his Colt, aimed for the stone, and fired.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam stood on the shore of a vast dark ocean. The water looked like ink, the ground beneath his feet black ash. Fragments of ivory bone poked through in places, most unrecognizable, but Sam saw several skulls, hands, and feet. The sky was a canopy of roiling shadow that stretched from horizon to horizon, but despite the complete lack of illumination, he had no difficulty seeing. Waves rolled into shore, moving thick and slow, more like tar than water, and when they broke they made a sound like sandpaper scraping bare flesh.</p><p>The last thing he remembered was taking a shot at Marshall Luss. After that, nothing.</p><p>“Am I dead?” he wondered aloud.</p><p>“Nearly.”</p><p>Sam turned to see a man standing next to him. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with short blond hair and a kind, gentle face. He wore a light blue button shirt and dark blue pants, and even though Sam had never seen him clearly before, he knew who he was.</p><p>“You’re the shadow figure I’ve been seeing.”</p><p>The man nodded. “The infection you acquired from the bite from Dippel’s hound made that possible. But you know that already.”</p><p>“What are you? A Reaper?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So I <em>am</em> dead.” Sam took in the surreal landscape around them. “I have to say, I’ve been dead before, and I don’t remember it being anything like this.”</p><p>“The infection combined with the amount of stimulants you took proved too great a strain for your body. However, as I said, you’re only <em>nearly</em> dead. This...” He spread his arms. “...is a construct of your subconscious. And a most theatrical one at that.”</p><p>“So you’re here to shepherd me to the afterlife. I don’t suppose there’s any way I can talk you out of it?”</p><p>“I have come to take you away from here, but our destination isn’t eternity. We both have unfinished business back in the realm of the living.”</p><p>“Dippel,” Sam said.</p><p>“Not anymore. He’s been... dealt with. Unfortunately, the creature that he’s brought into corporeal existence is a far more dangerous threat than he could ever be. She is Hel, the Norse goddess of death, and she is using the body of Bekah Luss as her vessel. I was trapped in the Lapis Occultus, but your brother freed me, allowing me to come to this mindscape you created in order to retrieve you. I can return your spirit to your own body and even counteract the necro-mystical infection that has almost destroyed you, but other than that, I can offer no help. Hel is too powerful for me to confront directly, especially since Dippel used a measure of my own power to resurrect both Marshall and Bekah.” The man lowered his gaze to the ashen ground. “My capacity for acting in the physical world is limited, and I’d hoped to... use you and your brother to help me stop Dippel. If I could have thought of any other way...”</p><p>Sam didn’t quite follow everything the Reaper said, but he got the gist.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. You were doing your job, just like we were doing ours. So, any advice for when I get back?”</p><p>“I’m only permitted to return you to life this one time because of the particular unnatural power that brought you to the edge of death. So my advice is, don’t die again.”</p><p>Sam smiled grimly. “I’ll do my best.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam opened his eyes. He felt better than he had in days, wide awake and full of energy, as if he’d just woken from the best night’s sleep he’d ever had. He still had hold of his Beretta, and he gripped it tight as he lifted his head slightly to survey the scene. Dippel was gone, nothing but an empty set of clothes to indicate he ever existed. A teenager he assumed was Bekah Luss—or at least her body—stood on the deck, cradling her right hand to her chest, an expression of venomous hatred on her face. Lying near her feet were scattered fragments of dark blue stone. The remnants of the Lapis Occultus, he assumed, whatever that was. Catherine Luss stood close to the creature that now wore her daughter’s form, looking lost and confused. Dean was getting to his feet, less than twenty feet away from Sam, facing Marshall Luss. He had his Colt drawn and aimed at the man, but Marshall seemed not to care. He snarled like an animal, but although his eyes blazed with fury, he made no move to attack Dean. The man’s hands and arms were no longer swathed in ebon energy—or rather, Sam could no longer see it. The Reaper had been true to his word. The infection was gone, but so was his death vision. He had to assume that Marshall was still capable of draining life force, which meant they had to keep him at bay, out of arm’s reach.</p><p>Sam took in all the details in an instant, along with one thing more: no one had noticed his restoration to the land of the living.</p><p><em>I’m sorry about this, Bekah,</em> he thought. He sat up and in one swift movement raised his Beretta and fired.</p><p>The girl’s head snapped back as the round penetrated her skull. Catherine Luss shouted, “No!” and rushed to her daughter’s side. But Bekah didn’t fall down. She straightened her head, and trained her gaze on Sam, a trickle of black blood running from the new hole in her forehead.</p><p>“You seem to have made a remarkable recovery, boy. I wonder if you had help.”</p><p>She held out her hand, and the bullet popped out of the hole and landed in her palm. She regarded it for a moment before turning her palm downward and allowing it to clatter to the deck.</p><p>“This body was created to be strong, and now that it is imbued with my power, it cannot be harmed by such simple means. You cannot stop me, hunter. My new servant will drain the life essence from both of you, then I shall animate your husks and make you the first recruits in my army of the dead.”</p><p>Dean didn’t take his eyes off Marshall as he said, “Nice shot. Good to have you back.”</p><p>“Good to be back. So we’ve got another rogue god on our hands, huh?”</p><p>“Can you believe it? The damned things are crawling out of the woodwork like cockroaches.”</p><p>“And it sounds like she plans to take over the world,” Sam added.</p><p>“Yeah. Big surprise. You ever wonder if these jokers actually give any thought to what they’d do with the world once they’ve conquered it? It’s a pretty big place.”</p><p>“Be a real bitch to keep clean,” Sam said.</p><p>Bekah’s features tightened with Hel’s anger. “I shall not permit such mockery. Marshall—kill them both.”</p><p>“Bad men!” Marshall growled, and then started toward Dean, hands raised. Although Sam could no longer see it, he knew black death energy radiated from them.</p><p>Dean was through fooling around. He fired his Colt twice, putting a round in each of Marshall’s legs. The man didn’t seem phased by the wounds, but his legs collapsed out from under him, sending him sprawling to the ground. Dean tucked the Colt into his pants and took hold of the flamethrower’s nozzle.</p><p>“This stuff might be diluted, but I’m betting it’s still got a spark or two left in it.” He thumbed the release button and pumped several streams of liquid onto Marshall. The man squeezed his eyes shut and sputtered as the watered-down kerosene splashed his face. He struggled to rise to his feet, blood pouring from the fresh wounds to his legs. Dean released the flamethrower’s nozzle and removed a flare from his jacket pocket. He pulled off the striking cap, lit it, and tossed the blazing flare onto Marshall.</p><p>Flames erupted across the man’s body, and although he’d seemed unaffected by gunshot wounds, this was a pain he was unable to withstand. He let out an ear-piercing howl of pure agony.</p><p>“Oh my god!” Catherine shrieked. “Marshall!”</p><p>Hearing his wife’s voice, Marshall staggered to his feet and lurched in the direction of the deck. Whatever difference the Lapis Occultus had made in the man’s resurrection, it hadn’t caused him to be any less flammable than Dippel’s other creations. Within seconds, Marshall had become a mobile bonfire, flames roaring and crackling, greasy smoke rising into the sky, filling the air with the gut-churning smell of burning flesh. He cried out in agony one more time before his voice cut out, destroyed by fire.</p><p>Catherine tried to go to him, but Hel grabbed her arm and stopped her.</p><p>She struggled to pull herself free from the creature inhabiting her daughter’s body. “Let me go! I’m a doctor!”</p><p>“I fear your husband is beyond all help, medical or mystical.” Hel flicked her hand toward Marshall and tendrils of ebon energy extended from her fingers. They struck Marshall like five black whips, and then retracted back into Hel’s flesh. Marshall stood still for a moment, flames burning furiously, then he fell to his knees and collapsed onto his side. He lay still as the fire continued to devour what was left of his flesh.</p><p>Hel released Catherine, and she whirled to face the dark goddess. “What did you do?”</p><p>“He had no need of what life force remained to him, so I took it. We gods no longer enjoy the high stations we once did, nor do we receive the offerings and sacrifices that are ours by divine right. Because of this, we’ve learned over the long, lean years not to waste resources. Or as your people would say, ‘waste not, want not.’” She smiled. “Of course, all of this will change once my darkness has cloaked your world in everlasting night. There are so many more of you now than there were during my time, and every one of you shall fall down and worship me. And if you refuse...” Her smile turned ice-cold. “...you’ll just fall down.”</p><p>While Hel spoke to Catherine, Dean walked over to Sam. “I don’t suppose you brought back any knowledge about how to defeat this bitch with you from the Other Side?”</p><p>“Afraid not.”</p><p>“You think if we put enough rounds in her, she’ll go down long enough for us to burn her?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It might work. If I remember right, the Norse viewed Hel’s domain as a realm of eternal ice and cold where those who died of sickness or old age were condemned.” When Dean gave him a questioning look, he added, “The Vikings preferred to die a glorious death in battle so they could get into Valhalla, the hall of heroes.”</p><p>“That’s the one where you fight all day and feast all night, right? Doesn’t sound half bad. So you’re thinking that fire is the opposite of ice, and if we give her a hotfoot, it might take her out. All right, let’s reload and put that theory to the test.”</p><p>“Don’t bother.”</p><p>They looked up to see Hel walking toward them. Catherine remained standing on the deck, watching, eyes filled with despair, sorrow etched on her face.</p><p>“I’m not deaf, you know,” she said with a smug smile. “While Niflheim is indeed a harsh frozen landscape, I am Death, and what is fire but the ultimate devourer, the ultimate killer? Flames cannot harm me.”</p><p>“I told you, I’ve met Death—“ Dean began.</p><p>“Fine,” Hel snapped. “So I’m <em>a</em> death, not <em>the</em> Death. You may think of me as his little sister, if it helps. Whatever I am, I’m more than a match for a pair of mortals like you.”</p><p>She stopped when she reached them. “Any last words before I turn you into my undead slaves?”</p><p>“I can think of a couple,” Dean said, “but I don’t think they’re appropriate to say to someone underage.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t certain, but he thought he heard a voice whisper next to his ear. It said, <em>Catherine.</em></p><p>Sam didn’t know what he was supposed to do, or if the voice was real or just another hallucination, so he just started talking and hoped something would come to him. “Catherine, I know you only wanted to bring your family back. The pain of losing someone you love... it’s indescribable. And no matter how much time passes, that pain never goes away, not completely. You think if only you could have a little more time with them, you’d say all the things you never got around to saying, do all the things you put off when they were alive. You pray for a miracle, and sometimes, one happens. In your case, Conrad found you, and with his help, you learned how to restore life to the dead. But when people come back, they’re not the same. Their personalities, their souls are gone, and what returns is... something else. My brother and I, we’ve seen it happen before. We knew a girl called Trish...” He trailed off. “My point is we watched someone we loved brought back as a horrible, murderous thing, and we had to—to make it right again.”</p><p>Catherine’s face gave no hint of whether Sam’s words had any impact on her, or indeed, if they’d registered at all.</p><p>Hel sneered at Sam. “How sentimental.” She raised her hands and tendrils of darkness began to emerge from her fingers.</p><p>Sam could feel Dean tense, and he knew his brother intended to go down shooting. It might not stop Hel, but it was better than standing there and letting her kill them without a fight. Neither of them had gotten a chance to reload, and he didn’t know how many rounds remained in his clip, but he didn’t care. Whatever he had left, he’d make sure they counted.</p><p>Before the brothers could begin firing, Catherine said, “Wait!”</p><p>She stepped off the deck and came walking toward them. She glanced at the remains of her husband. The flames had died away for the most part, leaving behind only a blackened, smoldering husk. Sam thought he saw her lips tighten, but otherwise her expression remained neutral as she joined them.</p><p>Sam exchanged a look with his brother. They couldn’t shoot now, not without hitting Catherine, too.</p><p>“Before this goes any farther, I want you to tell me something, Hel. I understand that you’re in control of Bekah’s body, and that your spirit is dominant, but is she anywhere inside? And if so, is she aware of what’s happening?”</p><p>The ebon tendrils slithered back into Hel’s fingers, and she turned to face Catherine. “If I say yes, will you follow me loyally and without question? Even though I no longer need an agent in the physical world, I have to admit that Conrad had his uses. You would make a suitable replacement.”</p><p>“If my daughter is within you, then yes, I will serve you.”</p><p>Hel smiled. “Of course she’s here. Can’t you tell?”</p><p>Catherine stepped closer and peered into Hel’s eyes. She stared for several moments, looking deeply, before finally nodding. “I can see her. She <em>is</em> in there.” She stepped back. “I am yours, Hel.” She smiled. “Till death do us part.”</p><p>Hel let out a laugh and then turned to face Sam and Dean. Once more the goddess raised her hands, and Sam knew they couldn’t wait any longer. They were going to have to start firing and hope Catherine didn’t catch a stray bullet.</p><p>Catherine reach into the pocket of her lab coat and withdrew something sharp and silvery. Sam had just enough time to realize it was a scalpel before she plunged it into the base of Hel’s skull. Hel’s eyes went wide, more from surprise than pain. Catherine flicked the scalpel’s blade back and forth with a single deft motion. Hel’s eyes rolled white. She collapsed to the ground, the scalpel handle still protruding from her skull.</p><p>Catherine, Sam, and Dean stood looking down at the body of Bekah Luss for several seconds. Then Catherine spoke in a toneless voice. “If you want to know death, study life. It’s why doctors make the best killers.”</p><p>“You severed the connection between her brain and spinal cord,” Sam said.</p><p>Catherine nodded. “I don’t know how long it will take Hel to heal the wound and restore life to Bekah’s body. I left the scalpel in place in the hope it will slow her down, at least a little. But as powerful as she is, she will heal. It’s just a matter of time.”</p><p>“We should burn her,” Dean said. “If Hel can’t work her mojo, fire should take care of her as easily as...” He glanced at Marshall’s charred remains. “...anything else.” He reached for the flamethrower’s nozzle.</p><p>“Not yet,” Catherine said. “There’s something we should do first—as insurance, if nothing else.”</p><p>“What’s that?” Sam asked.</p><p>She raised her eyes and regarded the Winchesters grimly. “Disassembly.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. In unison, they put away their pistols and reached for their KA-BAR knives.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’m getting tired of digging graves,” Dean said.</p><p>“Me, too.”</p><p>The crapmobile cruised through the night on I-70, heading west, Dean behind the wheel, Sam riding shotgun.</p><p>After they’d “disassembled” Bekah’s body, they’d burned the parts and buried them separately in the Luss’s back yard. When that chore was finished, they buried Marshall’s remains as well. The sun had long dropped below the horizon by that point, and Catherine invited them in for a drink. They accepted, feeling more than a little awkward. As they stood in her kitchen and drank tap water, she thanked them for their help.</p><p><em>What am I going to do now?</em> Catherine had asked. <em>I’ve done terrible things. I never asked where Conrad found the limbs and organs I needed, but I knew where they came from</em>—<em>especially the freshest ones. And the experiment that got loose, the dog... it killed people. Those deaths are on my hands, too. I may not have taken any lives directly, but I’m just as responsible as if I had. I don’t even have Dippel’s excuse of being manipulated by a dark goddess. I was just a sad, lonely woman who missed her family. I’d go to the police and turn myself in, but what good would it do? No one would believe my story.</em></p><p>The only physical evidence left was her homemade lab in the basement. She could lead the cops to the remains of Marshall and Bekah, but there was a chance that, like Frankenmutt and the Double-Header, they’d decay to nothing soon. Besides, she didn’t want anyone disturbing Bekah’s various graves, just in case doing so somehow freed Hel. They had no idea if the goddess’s spirit had returned to the realm it had come from—Sniffleham or something like that; Dean couldn’t remember—but none of them wanted to take any chances.</p><p><em>Start your practice back up,</em> Sam had suggested. <em>Return to helping people. Isn’t that why you became a doctor in the first place? Besides, what better way to fight death than by preserving life?</em></p><p>Catherine had thought for a moment. <em>I think... I think maybe Marshall and Bekah would like that. But should I? Is redemption even possible?</em></p><p>Dean had taken that one. <em>Doc, if we didn’t believe it is, we wouldn’t be able to get out of bed in the morning.</em></p><p>“Too bad the Lapis Occultus was destroyed,” Sam said. “I think it might have been another name for the Philosopher’s Stone, in which case it could’ve made a powerful weapon to use against Dick Roman.”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “No use crying over shattered mystical artifacts. I’m glad to see you’re feeling better, though. You finally manage to fight off that infection?”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Looks like it.” He crossed his leg and pulled up the cuff of his pants. “See? No more weird black veins.”</p><p>“That’s a relief. We’ll save a ton of money on coffee.” Dean paused before asking his next question. “You... seeing things?”</p><p>Sam tugged his pants cuff back down. “You mean like a strange shadow man? Don’t worry. I don’t think I’m going to see him anymore.”</p><p>Something about Sam’s tone made Dean think he was missing something, but he decided to let it go. “You think the doc is going to be okay?”</p><p>“I don’t know. We were raised in this life, and the stuff we go through still messes us up. I can’t imagine how much worse it is for a normal person. But if she starts seeing patients again, surrounds herself with life instead of brooding on death, I think she stands a chance.”</p><p>“In our business, sometimes a chance is all you need.”</p><p>They drove in silence for a while. Dean almost turned on the radio, but he decided against it. He didn’t feel like music just then.</p><p>After a time, Sam said, “I’ve been thinking.”</p><p>“There’s a shocker,” Dean said.</p><p>“Remember those dreams I had about Trish?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It occurred to me that we never did anything about the Rifleman.”</p><p>Dean did some quick mental calculating. “It’ll only take thirty-five or forty hours to get to Washington State from here, assuming we drive straight through.”</p><p>“I’m wide awake,” Sam said, smiling.</p><p>Dean sniffed the air and caught a whiff of stink coming from the trunk.</p><p>“Maybe we should stop at a Laundromat and wash our funkified clothes first.”</p><p>“Let’s find a Dumpster to toss them into, and buy more when we get to Washington.”</p><p>“Sounds like a plan.”</p><p>The brothers continued traveling through the darkness.</p>]]></content>
