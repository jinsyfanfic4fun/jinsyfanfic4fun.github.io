The birds had fallen quiet in the live oaks, and even the breeze had gone still, creating a deep, expectant hush that enveloped the entire field below. The world seemed to be holding its breath.</p><p>Then he saw them—soldiers in blue lining up along the rocky rampart on the other side of the creek. Even from this distance Beauchamp could see their muskets and the buttons on their uniforms glinting in the sun.</p><p>A moment later, they attacked.</p><p>Beauchamp didn’t think. He charged full-tilt down the hill toward the high grass along the creek. His vision jostled, jerking up and down and side-to-side with the force of his own velocity. He could see the muddy creek water now, glinting through the reeds like broken glass. Grasshoppers and tiny insects flew out of the path of his boots. His legs felt as if they had detached from him, pinioning forward hard and fast, gobbling up swathes of the uneven field in long, hungry strides.</p><p>Behind him, there was a roar as his men launched themselves over the hilltop and followed him in his headlong charge.</p><p>Down below, Union riflemen rose up and fired from the other side of the embankment, the cracks of their guns sounding like heavy books being dropped on a library floor.</p><p>Then he was in the middle of it.</p><p>Beauchamp’s own soldiers began firing back, running while they were shooting, stopping only to reload or when minie balls found them and pitched them permanently to the ground with unuttered cries of pain still lodged in their throats. Men were screaming now, letting out the Rebel yell or shrieks of agony.</p><p>Often it was hard to tell one from the other.</p><p>He sprinted the final few feet to the bottom of the hill. Breathing hard, staggering a little, he slowed his step until he was trotting, and then came to a complete halt in the middle of the clearing. All around him, his men were skirmishing hard and close, engaging the enemy on either side, filling his peripheral vision with the blurring, grunting work of hand-to-hand combat. A soldier flew past him and hit the ground, clutching his chest.</p><p>Beauchamp flicked the sweat from his eyes, focusing all his attention on one of the Union sharpshooters who stood behind the ridge, not twenty yards away.</p><p>He felt himself going absolutely still. Time seemed to freeze in its traces. He could smell the dust and gunpowder now, the cypress trees and the slow muddy odor of the creek, the smoke, sweat, and horses and coppery fresh blood, everything heightened to an almost agonizing degree. Everything else—the orders he’d been given, the town below that they were sworn to defend, the lives of the men around him—disappeared.</p><p>Even the sounds of battle dropped away until all he could hear was the pounding of his own heart.</p><p>The sharpshooter was a farm kid not much older than Beauchamp himself. He could see the Yankee’s musket, a .58 caliber Springfield like his own, pointing right at him. He saw the rifleman relax a little, confidence easing into the kid’s face as he drew a bead on his target. From this distance it would be almost impossible to miss.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>That was the Yankee’s musket, accompanied by the muzzle flash bright in the midday heat. Beauchamp saw the little puff of smoke drifting upward.</p><p>Smiling, he waited for it...</p><p>And felt nothing.</p><p>The Union soldier blinked, waiting for him to fall. Still smiling, Beauchamp reached down to pull out his bayonet. It was sharp enough that he could see the honed bevel, and he admired the way it caught the light.</p><p>Do it. Do it now.</p><p>Working carefully, he drew the tip across his own wrist, cutting through the skin so that the blood dripped directly onto his musket, running down its barrel. Then he pointed it at the Union soldier, drew in a breath, letting it out and squeezing the trigger at the same time.</p><p>The musket kicked hard against his shoulder, and the bluecoat’s head disappeared in a cloud of blood and skull fragments, his entire body blown backward by the force of the shot.</p><p>Beauchamp breathed.</p><p>Time broke and began to flow forward again. The sounds of the day returned. All around him, men were screaming—his men, the enemy’s men, all the men in this insane, blood-choked world. It made Beauchamp feel dizzy and ecstatic and drunk at the same time, as the 32^nd^ surged past him to overwhelm the Yankee rampart.</p><p>Beauchamp raised one hand and visored his eyes against the glaring sun. Up ahead, in the direction of Mission’s Ridge, the Confederate flag was still flying high. Glimpsing it there, unfurled across the wide blue sky, he felt the walls of his throat tighten with emotion. He raised his musket again, but didn’t reload.</p><p>Instead, he aimed the barrel outward. Somewhere to his left, one of his fellow soldiers, a private named Gamble, was staring at him, mouth half-open.</p><p>“What—“ Gamble was struggling to breathe, “what happened?”</p><p>Beauchamp just grinned at him. He could feel the air around his face vibrating a little, almost as if it was coming alive against his skin. The enigmatic majesty of the day was booming through him, like a shot of adrenaline straight to his neural plexus.</p><p>“I shot him.”</p><p>“You killed him?”</p><p>Beauchamp’s grin didn’t falter.</p><p>“That’s right,” he answered.</p><p>“But how?”</p><p>“Easy as pie,” Beauchamp said, and he turned the bloody musket around so that the bayonet was pointed straight at the private’s disbelieving face. With a thrust, he shoved the blade straight into Gamble’s right eye.</p><p>The private screamed, but it didn’t sound like a Rebel yell anymore—it was a yodeling squeal of pain and terror.</p><p>Like the noise a suckling pig makes beneath the butcher’s cleaver, Beauchamp mused.</p><p>Gamble collapsed, cupping his eyes, blood pouring through his fingers, and rolled onto his side. Beauchamp rammed the bayonet between his ribs, rolled him over, and stabbed him in the heart.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Beauchamp looked up.</p><p>A hush had swept across the open field again. There wasn’t even so much as a whisper of breeze. All around him, on both sides of the barricade, men had lowered their weapons and were staring at him with expressions of sheer disbelief. It was as if God—or some other deity—had pulled the plug on the entire enterprise.</p><p>From where he stood, alone in the open field, Beauchamp looked past the rampart to the sawhorses that divided the field from the parking lot where rows of cars and RVs and motorcycles glinted in the sun. Spectators—men and women and kids—were all gaping at him. Some of them turned away, covering their children’s eyes.</p><p>A radio played tinny music. He could hear a woman’s voice, very clearly.</p><p>“That’s real blood, ain’t it?”</p><p>“Dave...?”</p><p>Another man in a Confederate uniform and slouch cap came jogging toward him, haversack slapping against his left hip. He stopped when he saw Beauchamp standing over the bleeding corpse of Gamble at his feet. His face looked pale, and for a second he couldn’t even speak.</p><p>“Dave. Jesus. Dude... what did you ?”</p><p>Beauchamp twisted his head around. He grinned again, placing the tip of the bayonet under his own chin, feeling the sharp tip against the soft part of the flesh.</p><p>“War is hell,” he said, and he shoved the blade upward.</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam Winchester was dreaming.</p><p>He dreamt he was standing in front of a picture window in a high-roller’s suite at the Bellagio, with all the gaudy lights of Vegas spilled out below him like a handful of cheap jewelry.</p><p>Behind him, a smooth voice on the flat-screen plasma TV was giving him instructions for blackjack, an in-room tutorial that played twenty-four-seven on this particular channel.</p><p>Sam wasn’t listening.</p><p>Somehow, in the dream he understood that he’d come here to gamble and that he’d won—won big. Turning around, he saw piles of chips and cash heaped on the unmade bed next to an empty champagne bottle that nestled in a chrome bucket full of half-melted ice.</p><p>The voice on the TV droned on in the easy, mellifluous manner of a lounge magician’s patter.</p><p>“When the player chooses to double-down, it always behooves him to look at the dealer’s card first, and then his own.”</p><p>The voice changed, brightening a little.</p><p>“How about you, Sam? Do you know what the dealer’s holding?”</p><p>Sam glanced up at the screen. The face he saw there was familiar, from other dreams and nightmares through which he’d been suffering every night.</p><p>Lucifer.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>“Go away,” Sam said. His voice was pinched tight. A feeling of tension was gathering around his throat, hot friction taut against his skin, constricting his vocal cords. “Leave me alone.”</p><p>“Afraid I can’t do that, Sam,” Lucifer replied. “Not now. Not ever.”</p><p>Sam tried to respond, but this time nothing came out. He couldn’t even breathe.</p><p>“Look at yourself,” Lucifer said, and then he was standing next to Sam. “Take a good long look in the mirror and tell me what you see.”</p><p>Look at himself? That was easy. There was no shortage of mirrors in the suite.</p><p>He turned to the nearest one, fingers already clutching for whatever was tightening around his neck. But all he could detect in the mirror was a faint rippling of the skin around his throat.</p><p>Behind him, Lucifer started laughing.</p><p>“You won’t remember most of this when you wake up,” he said, almost sympathetically. “But you’ll know that I’m coming for you.”</p><p>Sam still couldn’t speak. Deep bruise-colored marks were appearing like a collar around his neck. He saw them darkening, forming like the imprints of invisible hands.</p><p>Fear—panic—sprung up in his belly like a cold spike.</p><p>He wanted to scream.</p><p>Somehow he understood that if he could just manage to make a noise, it would stop. The marks would vanish and he’d be able to breathe again.</p><p>But he couldn’t.</p><p>And he couldn’t.</p><p>And he—</p><p>“Hey! Hey, Sam. Drooler.” There was a hand, shaking him, and none too gently. “Yo! Wake up.”</p><p>Sam grunted, jerked backward and opened his eyes, lifting his head away from the window. Behind the wheel of the Impala, Dean regarded him with a look of brotherly amusement.</p><p>“Wipe your face off, man, you look like a freakin’ glazed donut.”</p><p>Without saying a word, Sam grabbed the rearview mirror and tilted it down, lifting his chin to look at his neck. It was unblemished, the skin normal. He let out a breath and sank back into his seat, feeling more wrung-out than relieved.</p><p>Dean glanced over at him again, his expression carefully neutral.</p><p>“Bad dream?”</p><p>“You could say that.” Sam could feel Dean waiting for more, but the imagery was already starting to fade, leaving only a nebulous sense of dread. Trying to articulate it now would only make his brother more suspicious. “Anyway, I’m fine.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Dean didn’t sound convinced.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Good.” That was that.</p><p>Dean reached down to turn up the radio, where Lynyrd Skynyrd was trucking through one of the final iterations of ‘Sweet Home Alabama.’ The song had played twice in the last half-hour, but Dean dialed it up anyway, filling the silence with guitars and drums.</p><p>Sam found a fairly clean fast food napkin on the floor and wiped the corner of his mouth, then balled it up and peered out of the window at the scenery. Georgia pines and scrub oak flashed by—heavy forest. Beyond it lay miles of swampland interrupted only by the occasional plantation house, creeks, and hills—the same terrain that had challenged the soldiers of the North and South almost a hundred and fifty years earlier.</p><p>“How much further?” he asked.</p><p>“Shush, I love this part.” Dean turned the guitar solo up, lost in the moment, then came out of it. “Sorry, what’d you say?”</p><p>“You do realize we’re not in Alabama, right?”</p><p>“None of Skynyrd was from there, either.” Dean shrugged. “But you know where they recorded the song?”</p><p>“Let me guess—Georgia?”</p><p>Twenty minutes later they arrived at the cemetery.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The state police had cordoned off the front gates to keep the TV reporters out, along with what looked like at least a hundred curious onlookers. Some held homemade signs: “Cemetery Boy, We Love You” and “Come Home, Toby.” Driving through the crowd, Dean reached out of the window and flashed an FBI badge, and a trooper waved them through with the tired expression of an official long since exhausted with his duties.</p><p>Sam didn’t blame him. It was a zoo out there.</p><p>The graveyard itself was a sprawling old stretch of moss-covered swampland, dotted with ancient gray headstones, many of which sloped sideways or had fallen over, disappearing into the soft earth. The names had disappeared completely off many of the stones, leaving only smooth amnesiac marble.</p><p>Dean parked the Impala under a tall oak tree and he and Sam climbed out, wearing ill-fitting suits that clung to them in the heat. They walked toward the police cruisers and blue uniforms clustered a hundred yards ahead.</p><p>“So,” Dean said, “this kid, Cemetery Boy...”</p><p>“Toby Gamble,” Sam said.</p><p>“Four days ago he disappears from the house.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Nobody sees a thing.”</p><p>“As far as I know.”</p><p>“And then, yesterday morning...”</p><p>They stopped in front of the mausoleum where a few of the cops were gathered, drinking coffee. Most were staring at the words that had been scrawled directly on the stone in childish, dark reddish-brown letters.</p><p>HALP ME</p><p>“Kid isn’t much of a speller,” Dean commented.</p><p>“He’s only five.”</p><p>“Probably a product of home-schooling.”</p><p>“So are we.” Sam checked the pages he’d printed out earlier. “His mom confirmed that it’s his handwriting.”</p><p>“And the blood?”</p><p>“Sample’s still at the lab.”</p><p>“So that’s all we got?”</p><p>“That,” Sam said, “and this.”</p><p>He pointed over the hill. Dean looked at the headstones that stood on the western edge of the cemetery.</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>The stones, dozens of them, were all splattered and streaked with the same crooked, spidery childish handwriting.</p><p>HALP ME HALP ME HALP ME HALP ME HALP ME</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“At least he’s consistent.”</p><p>“His mother says she heard voices in his room the night before he disappeared.”</p><p>“What kind of voices exactly?”</p><p>“We can ask.” Sam turned and glanced back at a blonde woman who was standing next to the police. She was in her early twenties, but thin and tired in a way that made her look at least two decades older. It was easy to imagine her waiting tables on a Saturday night, bussing trays of empty bottles and getting pinched by drunken patrons while the jukebox yodeled out this month’s country anthem.</p><p>Moving closer, Sam could see that she was holding what looked like a pale blue rag, wringing it in her hands and clutching it to her chest. After a moment he realized it was a child’s t-shirt.</p><p>“I just want him back,” she was saying, her voice thick with barely-contained emotion. “I just want my boy back.”</p><p>“Ma’am?” Dean asked, stepping up next to her.</p><p>She jerked her head up, startled and red-eyed. The cop she had been talking to eyed them warily.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’m Agent Townes, this is Agent Van Zandt, FBI. We were wondering if we could ask you a few questions about your son.”</p><p>“I’ve already talked to the police.”</p><p>“This will only take a minute.”</p><p>“I don’t... I’m sorry... I just don’t know if I can...”</p><p>“The voices you heard in your son’s bedroom,” Dean persisted, “what were they saying?”</p><p>“It was... words, some language I didn’t understand. Then they just kept saying his name. At first...” new tears began to well up in her eyes, “I just thought it was the TV. Then I heard him scream. I ran inside, but he was already gone.”</p><p>She shook her head, pale blue eyes flashing out over the cemetery, and held the t-shirt closer to her chest.</p><p>“When I heard about all of this, I thought...”</p><p>There was a sudden shriek from across the graveyard, and Sam and Dean spun around, searching for the source of the noise.</p><p>An African-American man was walking from between the tombstones, and he was carrying a young boy in his arms. The child’s entire upper body was splashed and splattered with scarlet, but he was alive, squirming in the man’s grip.</p><p>“You!” one of the cops shouted. “Freeze! Drop the boy, now!” He pulled his pistol and aimed it at the newcomer.</p><p>Sam scowled.</p><p>“Is that...?”</p><p>“Rufus?” Dean blinked. “What the hell...?”</p><p>Dean and Sam stepped toward their fellow hunter. The jittery policeman lowered his gun, puzzled by their familiarity with the apparently blood-soaked stranger.</p><p>Rufus Turner stopped and released the boy, who immediately ran over to his mother.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rufus said, and he glanced down at his jacket. It too, was covered with red. “Except for the damn karo syrup all over my clothes.”</p><p>“Karo syrup?”</p><p>“Kid had a whole bottle of it stashed behind the trees over there.”</p><p>The boy was talking now. Though he was speaking in a low tone, his words were clear.</p><p>“Mommy, I don’t want to play this game anymore,” he said, hugging his mother—who suddenly looked as though she didn’t want to be anywhere near here. “I’m hungry, and my stomach feels funny.”</p><p>Then, abruptly, he threw up.</p><p>“Swell,” Dean muttered, and he cast a glance at Rufus. “I didn’t know you were on this one already.”</p><p>Rufus shrugged.</p><p>“I was in the neighborhood, headed over to the town of Mission’s Ridge. Thought I might stop in here first and see what’s what. Now my last clean shirt looks like somebody did heart surgery in it.”</p><p>“Sir, we’ve got some questions,” one of the plainclothes detectives said. “Would you mind coming with us?”</p><p>“You gonna pay my dry cleaning bill?” Rufus asked.</p><p>Sam glanced up.</p><p>“What’s the Mission’s Ridge thing?”</p><p>“Shooting during a Civil War re-enactment,” Rufus said quietly. “Couple of civilians died.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“The guns were replicas.” Rufus looked at them. “And they were covered in blood.”</p><p>“Real blood this time?”</p><p>“That’s what I heard.”</p><p>“That’s it?” Dean asked. “Where d’you hear about it?”</p><p>“Anonymous email tip. Source up in Maryland of all places.”</p><p>Dean scowled.</p><p>“Maryland?”</p><p>“Place called Ilchester. Why, have you heard of it?”</p><p>Dean turned to Sam, who was already staring at him.</p><p>“Who was your source?”</p><p>“I told you. Anonymous.”</p><p>“Then we’ll take that one,” Dean said. “Give us whatever you’ve got, and we’ll work it.”</p><p>“You sure? Why are you so interested?” Rufus asked.</p><p>“Forget it,” Dean said. “You go get your jacket cleaned.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>An hour later Dean took one hand off the wheel and pointed at the sign that stood on the right side of the two-lane highway.</p><p>WELCOME TO HISTORIC MISSION’S RIDGE,<br>GEORGIA, FRIENDLIEST LITTLE<br>TOWN IN THE SOUTH<br>“WE’RE DANG GLAD YOU’RE HERE!”</p><p>“See, I told’ya this was a good idea,” Dean said. “They’re dang glad.”</p><p>Sam glanced up from the open laptop on his knees.</p><p>“Wonder if the victims of the massacre enjoyed that famous Southern hospitality, too,” he said dryly.</p><p>“Hey. So what’s the Ilchester connection?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Somebody wants us here.”</p><p>“Or doesn’t.”</p><p>“Either way...”</p><p>“Let’s call it what it is, Sammy,” Dean said. “St. Mary’s Convent in Ilchester, Maryland, is where you set Lucifer free. That’s not a coincidence.”</p><p>“I know.” Not wanting to dwell on it, Sam turned his attention to the outskirts. Crossing a set of train tracks, they reached the center of town.</p><p>From their vantage point, Mission’s Ridge consisted of a narrow main street with storefronts on both sides. Pedestrians milled around on the sidewalks, none of them in a hurry to get anywhere. Overhead, a banner announced the annual historical celebration and re-enactment of the Battle of Mission’s Ridge. Whole families of curiosity-seekers wandered in and out of antique shops and cheap-looking museums advertising Civil War relics, moonlight ghost tours, and historical photos of you and your family in “genuine old time costumes.”</p><p>None of them seemed particularly bothered by the recent shootings out on the battlefield.</p><p>They were driving through downtown proper now. Dean slowed down even more, finally easing the Impala to a stop. In front of them, a pair of tanned young women in denim cutoffs and halter-tops sauntered slowly by, one of them stopping and lowering her sunglasses to look in at Dean.</p><p>“On the other hand,” he shook his head, smiling, “I do love the South.”</p><p>Sam heard a wolf-whistle, and one of the women glanced up. From the other side of the street, two young Civil War soldiers in dusty Confederate uniforms and slouch caps walked in front of the Impala to meet the girls. The four of them stood in the intersection chatting, one of the girls reaching out to admire the soldiers’ muskets.</p><p>“Hey!” Dean shouted out of the side window. “Mason and Dixon! War’s over!”</p><p>The two soldiers ignored him. Dean blew the horn and one of the men raised an upturned finger in what Sam didn’t think was a historically-accurate gesture. Slowly the quartet moved away.</p><p>“Come on.” Sam couldn’t help a smile. “Battlefield’s on the other side of town.”</p><p>“Right.” Still the car remained where it sat.</p><p>“Dean.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Focus.”</p><p>“I am, I am.” He was still watching the girls and the soldiers in the side-view mirror. “Man, a job with travel is supposed to come with a few perks.” Then he shrugged and turned to Sam. “Here, fix your tie, it’s crooked.” He reached over to help, and Sam flinched.</p><p>Dean frowned.</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Sam hesitated.</p><p>“It’s that dream I had earlier. I don’t really remember much of it, except there was something around my throat, squeezing. And I couldn’t breathe.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>Dean didn’t look convinced, and Sam couldn’t blame him. Nevertheless, he didn’t remember the details, and any attempt to describe the vague feeling of dread would just make Dean even more on edge. If he did recall more—about the voice that had spoken to him, and what it had said—he’d share it.</p><p>Until then, he’d keep his silence.</p><p>Time to change the subject.</p><p>“On the bright side,” he said, “at least we’ve got a wi-fi signal.”</p><p>Turning back to the laptop, Sam scrolled through the various links his “Mission’s Ridge” search had dredged up. There were ample references to the historic battle, and the town’s annual re-enactment. But most of it was overshadowed by the previous day’s reports of a Civil War re-enactor who had inexplicably managed to kill himself and two others with a replica musket and a bayonet no sharper than a butter knife.</p><p>The details matched what Rufus had told them back in the graveyard, with one notable exception: No mention was made of blood on the weapons.</p><p>“Looks like most of the fighting took place on a stretch of hillside along this creek, about two miles southeast of town,” Sam said, pointing to a map on the screen. “That’s where the re-enactors are camped now.”</p><p>“And that’s where the shooting took place?”</p><p>“Looks that way.”</p><p>Dean tapped the accelerator, turned the radio back up, and eased them down the main drag.</p><p>A short time later he found the Allman Brothers playing ‘Midnight Rider’—good solid Southern rock and roll—and turned it up, keeping the windows down to allow a breeze to flow through the car.</p><p>Soon they were out in the open countryside again, but the landscape was different now. The fields had been cleared, either by fire or real estate developers, and the grass was green, almost manicured. Sam could see monuments and cannons at the top of the next hill, along with rows of parked cars in a lot that seemed almost as big as the town they’d left behind. A large brown sign with bold white lettering stood on the right shoulder.</p><p>National Historic Site - No Relic Hunting.</p><p>“I’d say this is it,” Dean said, and he pulled into the lot, crawling between the rows until he found an empty spot alongside a row of Harleys. All of the bikes had Confederate flags hanging from poles off the back. “You ready for action?”</p><p>Sam nodded and got out.</p><p>“According to the news reports, the shooter’s name was Dave Wolverton. He was a waiter at a fast-food restaurant in Atlanta Airport. This was just a weekend thing for him.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Dean said, gesturing out beyond the parking lot, “he wasn’t the only one.”</p><p>As they reached high ground, Sam peered off to the west, and Dean saw a flicker of incredulity moving over his brother’s face. Beyond the rows of spectators stretched a hillside that seemed to travel back, not just spatially, but into the recesses of time itself. Whole armies of men in blue and gray uniforms were bivouacked along both sides of the creek that ran along the bottom of the hill. There were tents and wagons, horses, fires and cannons, flags and farm implements sprawled out for what looked like hundreds of acres, as far as the eye could see.</p><p>“What do you think?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t need this Civil War.”</p><p>They cut a path through the rows of onlookers, past a row of Porta-Johns where long lines of people—a mixture of those in shorts and Kid Rock t-shirts, and others in historic clothing—waited to use the facilities.</p><p>Beyond that, the camps themselves took over. Soldiers milled around tents, admiring each other’s weapons and uniforms. Women and children in similar attire moved through the crowds, and it seemed as if every conversation was filled with formalities the likes of which Dean hadn’t heard since he’d dragged Sam to dinner at a Medieval Times theme restaurant.</p><p>The sounds of bugles and cannon-fire boomed from above.</p><p>“You hear that?”</p><p>“It’s coming from up there,” Sam said, pointing at the loudspeakers mounted along the periphery of the hillside. “The information online said they can even pipe in authentic battle sounds.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said, “but where’s the funnel cake?”</p><p>“This isn’t a carnival, Dean.”</p><p>“Come on. It’s only history if you can eat it.”</p><p>Sam just shook his head and kept walking.</p><p>“The news reports say Wolverton’s unit was the 32^nd^.”</p><p>They made their way along the hillside through crowds of re-enactors, looking for some sign that would identify Wolverton’s group. Whether you could eat it or not, Dean thought, the gathering certainly bore one of the trappings of raw history; it didn’t make a lot of sense down here on ground level. Maybe viewed from above, certain patterns would begin to emerge, but—</p><p>Suddenly he was knocked to one side.</p><p>“Hey,” somebody snapped. “Watch where you’re going, ass-hat.”</p><p>The source of the comment was a burly, flush-faced Union soldier who looked as if he’d been enjoying far too much funnel cake, or whatever it was they served around the campfire.</p><p>Dean bristled.</p><p>“Excuse me?” he replied, planting his feet.</p><p>“Easy,” Sam said, and he glanced at the soldier. “We’re looking for the 32^nd^. Any chance you could steer us right?”</p><p>“Over that way,” the man replied, still glaring at Dean. “Five or six tents over.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Sam replied, and he nudged Dean in the right direction.</p><p>“Ass-hat,” Dean mused. “You think that’s an authentic Civil War expression?”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Somehow I doubt it.”</p><p>They walked deeper into the crowds of soldiers, past more tents and wagons. At one point Sam heard the clang of metal and looked over to see a muscular blacksmith bent over a forge, complete with an anvil and hot coals, banging out horseshoes, while a crowd of curious onlookers stood watching the sparks fly.</p><p>There was a railway shed next to the tree line, and off to their left, a makeshift corral of horses pushed their noses through the temporary wooden fence that had been set up to contain them. Delighted children held up apples and carrots for the animals to eat.</p><p>Finally, after wandering for another ten minutes, they came to a group of ten or twelve men in Confederate uniforms standing under a tattered canopy. One side of the tent was emblazoned with the identity of the group.</p><p>Fighting 32^nd^ – Commanches</p><p>As they approached, the breeze changed direction and Dean caught a whiff of sour body-odor and unwashed hair, mixed with an acrid ammonia odor that he normally associated with drunk-tanks and nursing homes.</p><p>These guys are taking the whole authenticity thing a little too seriously, he thought to himself. A glance at his brother confirmed that Sam was thinking the same thing.</p><p>They stepped up next to one of the poles that supported the canvas.</p><p>“Fellas,” he said.</p><p>The Confederates of the Fighting 32^nd^ gazed back at him flatly, with such an utter lack of affect that they could have all been mannequins. Two of them were cleaning their muskets, while a third crouched in the midday heat, pouring water from a canteen over his neck and face.</p><p>Two others shied away from Sam and Dean completely, ducking behind the parchment map they held in their hands.</p><p>“I’m Federal Agent Townes,” Dean pressed on. “This old boy is Agent Van Zandt. You guys soldiered with Dave Wolverton, didn’t you?”</p><p>“That’s right,” the closest man said, shouldering his gun. He was a tall, gangly fellow with a thick Brillo-burst of unkempt red hair and a wispy attempt at a beard that ran down his neck and only exaggerated the size of his bulging Adam’s apple.</p><p>“Were you there yesterday?” Dean asked.</p><p>The man nodded, and the look on his face said that he didn’t really want to remember.</p><p>“Yeah, I was right behind him... maybe ten paces back during the charge.” He stared off into the distance.</p><p>“So you saw what happened?”</p><p>“Yeah, I saw it.” He turned back to Dean, then gestured to the others around the tent. “We all did.”</p><p>“And we already talked to the sheriff.” The other soldier with a musket stepped forward. “Got nothing more to say.”</p><p>Dean sized up the second guy, a brooding bear of a man with shoulders like barn-beams and eyebrows that seemed to have been applied with a Magic Marker. He appeared to take his role much more seriously, tilting his chin upward, as if daring them to challenge him.</p><p>Dean just shook his head, unwilling to take the bait.</p><p>“Stand down, Lieutenant,” he said calmly. “Didn’t mean anything by it. They’re just questions.”</p><p>“I’m a private,” the bear growled. “Norwalk Benjamin Pettigrew, CSA, reporting for duty.”</p><p>“Is that your real name,” Sam asked, “or your...?”</p><p>“My what?”</p><p>“Your dress-up name,” Dean finished.</p><p>“This isn’t dress-up,” Brillo-Head objected. “We’re living historians. I’m Oren Henry Ashgrove. We’re all re-interpreters. We—“</p><p>“My real name’s Phil Oiler.”</p><p>It was the bear-like man. Admitting the truth appeared to take some of the menace out of him, shrinking him a little in his uniform, and Dean actually found himself feeling a little sorry for the guy. “I sell life insurance in Atlanta.”</p><p>“How well did you know Dave?”</p><p>“Oh, real well,” Ashgrove said. “He’s been with the 32^nd^ for years. That’s why what happened was so crazy. I mean, he was hardcore.…”</p><p>“Hardcore how?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Every way imaginable,” Oiler cut in. “He lost a ton of weight, for one thing. During the war, your average Confederate soldier weighed 135 pounds. When he first joined up, Dave went on the Atkins diet for two solid years just to fit the profile. Stuck rocks in his boots. Shaved his face with a rusty piece of tin. You hear about his uniform?”</p><p>“Thrill me,” Dean said.</p><p>“He was totally hardcore. The buttons... he soaked them in his own urine to properly oxidize the metal. He’s the one that started all that.”</p><p>“Hold up,” Dean said, realizing now what the other smell he’d caught must have been. “You’re saying you piss on your uniforms?”</p><p>“Not while we’re wearing ‘em. But yeah.” The look of admiration on the large man’s face was close to religious awe. “It’s the only way to get the authentic look. I mean...” The respectful tone shifted to one of near-disgust. “you walk through here and see some of these farbs standing around checking their stock portfolios on their BlackBerrys. They dishonor the uniform, you know? Not Dave. He was just so...”</p><p>“Hardcore?” Sam finished.</p><p>“Totally.”</p><p>“Hardcore enough that he might decide to bring a real gun to a historic re-enactment? Or a sharpened knife?”</p><p>The men shook their heads, but it seemed more like a gesture of disbelief than an actual answer—as if what Sam was suggesting was so sacrilegious that they lacked the words to respond.</p><p>“But you definitely saw him shooting?” Dean asked. “And you saw the other soldiers get hit?”</p><p>Ashgrove said nothing, but Oiler managed a stiff nod.</p><p>“So the weapons had to be hot,” Dean said. “Wolverton must have somehow modified the musket.”</p><p>He waited.</p><p>“Right?”</p><p>Now neither man spoke.</p><p>“Where are the weapons now?”</p><p>Ashgrove shrugged.</p><p>“The sheriff’s office, probably. Evidence.”</p><p>“Was there any blood on the weapons?” Sam asked.</p><p>“There was blood everywhere.”</p><p>“I mean, before Wolverton used them.”</p><p>Ashgrove gaped at them, bewildered.</p><p>“Why would there be?”</p><p>Before Sam could come up with a response, another soldier—a tall, bald man who had obviously been listening in on the conversation—glanced up from behind the map.</p><p>“I think all the blood came after,” he said.</p><p>Dean stepped toward him.</p><p>“And you are?”</p><p>The man stuck out his hand.</p><p>“Private Travis Wapshot, pleased to meet you.”</p><p>“You’re a part of Bad Company too?”</p><p>“The Commanches? Yeah, we’re a pretty tightly knit group.” Travis shrugged. “I guess it sounds crazy. And hell, I guess it probably is. But is it any nuttier than guys who drop ten grand in Vegas or run off for a wild weekend with their secretary?” He glanced at the grimy palms of his hands. “At least our dirt washes off.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Dean said. “That part with the secretary sounds pretty good to me.”</p><p>Travis scowled.</p><p>“Beg your pardon?”</p><p>“Forget it. Let me ask you something. Why  you put yourselves through all this?”</p><p>The three soldiers exchanged a brief, unguarded look. Finally Travis responded.</p><p>“Sometimes modern life is too easy. We want to know what it was like for those guys back then. That was genuine experience, you know? The real thing.” He paused in thought. “We had a guy in our unit, a pipe-fitter named Art Edwards, who died last year. Metastatic brain cancer. Ugly, drawn-out disease. But he trooped with us right up till his family put him in a hospice. He used to say his future didn’t look too bright to him. He preferred the past.”</p><p>“Maybe Dave Wolverton just got too fed up with the easy life,” Sam said. “Decided to chuck it all.”</p><p>The other two soldiers nodded soberly. It was hard to read their expressions.</p><p>“Can you think of anybody else who might be able to tell us about Dave?”</p><p>Travis nodded.</p><p>“You might want to talk to Will Tanner—he’s a private in the 32^nd^. He and Dave palled around a lot, I think. Even outside of the Commanches.”</p><p>“Is he here?”</p><p>“Haven’t seen him. I’ll see if I can dig up an email address, though.”</p><p>Ashgrove spoke up.</p><p>“And they should meet up with the new guy...” he said, “the surgeon...”</p><p>“Oh, yeah!” Oiler cut in. “You gotta talk to the surgeon. He’s super hardcore.”</p><p>“Sure,” Dean said. He’d had enough hardcore. “Well, hey, listen...”</p><p>“No, seriously! He’s set up the medical tent right over beyond those trees.” Oiler scowled. “He’s got this totally cool name for himself, too—Doctor... what was it again?” He glanced around at the rest of the group.</p><p>Ashgrove thought for a second and snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Oh yeah. Doctor Castiel.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The field hospital was nothing more than a stained canvas dog tent billowing in the breeze, fifty yards from the Commanches’ bivouac. Even before Sam and Dean arrived, they could hear the groans and cries of the men laid out inside.</p><p>“Doc, I’m gutshot.”</p><p>“It’s bonebreak fever... I can hear the angel band calling me...”</p><p>“Gimme a bullet to bite on. This leg’s got gangrene. I think it’s gonna have to come off—“</p><p>To Sam—who had seen more than his share of pain and dying—the performances sounded unnervingly realistic.</p><p>Where did they learn to make it sound so convincing? he wondered. And why would they want to?</p><p>He lifted the tent-flap and peered in. Everywhere he looked, soldiers were scattered almost shoulder-to-shoulder on mats laid across the floor, or sprawled directly on the dirt. Their groans and pleas were almost constant.</p><p>Standing in the middle of them, dressed in a shabby white coat that hung down to his knees, was the one man who looked even less like he belonged here than they did.</p><p>“Cass,” Dean said. “What’s going on? Why are you slumming with this crowd?”</p><p>Castiel didn’t even look up. He had his hand on one of the wounded men’s heads and his lips were moving slightly. Then he reached down and lifted the soldier upright, setting him on his feet and propelling him backward.</p><p>The re-enactor staggered away, nearly tripping over the bodies of the men behind him. Glaring with confusion, he looked up at Castiel.</p><p>“What the hell was that?”</p><p>“I’ve returned the strength to your legs,” Castiel replied, his expression unreadable. Turning his back on the man, he opened his hands again. “Who’s next?”</p><p>“Cass...” Dean started.</p><p>Still ignoring him, Castiel bent down over a soldier whose face was wrapped in layers of sagging, bloody bandages.</p><p>“Let me see,” he said, peeling away the gauze and laying his hands directly over the man’s eyes. “There. Now look upon me.”</p><p>The re-enactor frowned, blinking.</p><p>“Where’d you come from, bro?”</p><p>“Heaven,” Castiel said, and he began to lift the man’s bloodstained shirt. “Now let me see that chest wound.”</p><p>“Take your hands off me!” the man shouted, and he squirmed away.</p><p>Castiel froze, his arms still partially extended. Sam shot Dean a look.</p><p>All around the tent, the other “wounded” had begun to pull back, withdrawing to the corners without completely abandoning the pretense of injury. Finally Castiel looked back and noticed that the Winchesters were standing there watching him.</p><p>A slight frown creased his forehead.</p><p>“Whoa,” Dean said. “Awkward moment.”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Castiel asked.</p><p>Dean raised his eyebrows.</p><p>“Right back atcha, Cass.”</p><p>“I walked the battlefields of the South a hundred and sixty years ago,” Castiel replied, a faraway look entering his eyes. “I moved among the men and brought their souls to glory. And now...”</p><p>Something moved over his face for just an instant, so rare and brief that Dean almost didn’t catch it: a flicker of hope.</p><p>“And now,” he repeated, “I’m healing again.”</p><p>“Cass...” Dean shook his head. “You do realize that none of these jokers is actually hurt, don’t you?”</p><p>Castiel’s expression darkened, but he didn’t speak.</p><p>“See?” Dean nudged the man closest to him with his toe, and the re-enactor let out an authentic, well-rehearsed warble of pain. “It’s a show. Their hobby. Like those couples that dress up in furry animal suits and...”</p><p>“Dean,” Sam cut in.</p><p>“Sorry.” He turned back to the crippled angel and shrugged.</p><p>Castiel regarded the tent around him again and sighed. He turned away, taking off the white coat and tossing it to the floor.</p><p>Still avoiding their eyes, he picked up his familiar trenchcoat from the back of a chair and slipped it on. When he turned to face Sam and Dean again, his face was utterly composed. The hopefulness was gone, buried beneath an iron mask of grim determination.</p><p>“I have more pressing business to attend to,” he announced.</p><p>“The great God-hunt,” Dean said. “Tell me, is He a Civil War buff?”</p><p>“I found a lead recently,” Castiel announced. “A first-order witness.”</p><p>“Is that like a mail-order bride?”</p><p>“First-order witnesses are among the rarest of celestial beings. The term refers to one who actually broke bread with Christ Himself.”</p><p>“Six degrees of Jesus, huh?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Less than six. One.”</p><p>“What makes you think he’ll spill?”</p><p>“It is the break that I’ve been hoping for. Whoever the witness is, he will answer to me.”</p><p>“Gotta respect the confidence,” Dean said, “but let’s face it...”</p><p>Then he stopped.</p><p>The place where Castiel had been standing was already empty.</p><p>Shaking his head, he looked around. Several of the re-enactors had broken character completely and were standing up, staring in disbelief at the spot where Castiel wasn’t.</p><p>“Who was that freak?” one of them managed.</p><p>“Freak?” Dean looked around at them, grown men in costumes, huddled together with bruises and injuries painted on their faces, and Sam was afraid he was going to say something they’d both regret.</p><p>But he just shook his head.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” he said. “He won’t be back.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It was mid-afternoon—the sun still high in the sky, throwing long bars of tree-shadow across the two-lane highway—as Dean drove them back toward downtown Mission’s Ridge.</p><p>“You think there’s any connection between Castiel’s Jesus witness and what’s going on here in town?” Sam asked.</p><p>“How can there not be a connection?” Dean countered. “I mean, The Passion of the Christ isn’t exactly on my Netflix list, but just because Cass’s witness shared a Happy Meal with JC, it doesn’t mean he can’t be a trouble-making son of a bitch. And that sure as hell fits the description of whoever—or whatever—killed Dave Wolverton.”</p><p>“So you’re thinking demon.”</p><p>“For starters.”</p><p>“I’ll start running a search for the most common first-order witnesses currently in circulation.” Sam glanced at the speedometer and saw they were going eighty. “And you might want to ease up on the gas,” he added. “I don’t want to end up meeting the local sheriff under the wrong circumstances.”</p><p>“Yeah, what’s his name again?”</p><p>“Says here...” Sam checked the notes he’d copied from the internet. “Jack Daniels.”</p><p>Dean did a double-take.</p><p>“No way.”</p><p>“Would I make something like that up?”</p><p>“Sure you would.” He glanced at his brother, and then turned his attention back to the road. “I can’t wait to meet him.” But he slowed the Impala down closer to the speed limit.</p><p>“I’m sure the feeling’s mutual.”</p><p>Passing through downtown, Dean swung up to the curb in front of the sheriff’s office, parking next to the cruiser. The police vehicle gleamed as if it was newly washed and waxed, its windows down so Sam could hear the radio crackling faintly from inside. As they got out, he noticed an empty sandwich wrapper on the seat.</p><p>“Any guesses?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Lemmee see. I’m gonna say...” Dean paused, eyes half-closed, as if consulting some inner oracle, “mid-fifties, bald, big belly held in check with a Sam Browne belt.”</p><p>“Sixties,” Sam said, “handlebar moustache, full head of hair that he gets trimmed every Saturday morning over at Babe’s Barbershop. Oh yeah, and he’s rail-thin—one of those guys who can eat chicken-fried steak three times a day and not gain a pound.”</p><p>“‘Nam vet. Buford Pussar type. From Walking Tall.”</p><p>“Deliverance refugee. Civic citations all over his desk.”</p><p>“Son lost a leg in Desert Storm. Secretly he envies the kid.”</p><p>“Cheats on his taxes,” Sam said, swinging open the door. “Dotes on his wife.”</p><p>Dean snorted as they entered the sheriff’s station.</p><p>“Wears women’s underwear. Crotchless. The kind that—“</p><p>“Is there something I can help you with?”</p><p>Both Winchesters froze, and looked round at the same time.</p><p>Sam was the first to regain his composure.</p><p>“We’re... ah, looking for the sheriff. Jack Daniels.”</p><p>The woman in the snugly fitting brown uniform nodded.</p><p>“I’m Jacqueline Daniels.” She took three steps toward them, the heels of her leather boots clicking smartly on the tiled entryway. She wasn’t quite as young as the two women they’d spotted in the street—Sam guessed she was in her early thirties—but her brown eyes and full lips suggested a vitality that wasn’t going to fade anytime soon.</p><p>Dean, meanwhile, wasn’t looking at her eyes at all. He was staring at the badge she wore, which shone as if polished with the same fervor as the cruiser outside.</p><p>“Sheriff Daniels, is it?” With some effort, he shifted his attention. “I’m Agent Townes,” he said, pulling out his ID, “and this is Agent Van Zandt—“</p><p>“Townes?” the sheriff said. “Van Zandt? Is that supposed to be some kind of joke?”</p><p>Sam cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>“Beg your pardon?”</p><p>She shot them a look.</p><p>“Your names,” she said.</p><p>“Look, are you suggesting...” Dean puffed.</p><p>“Either you’re pulling my leg,” she continued, staring at them doubtfully, “Or your superior has one warped sense of humor.”</p><p>Dean sighed.</p><p>“Yeah, and people probably call you Jackie, right?”</p><p>“They call me Sheriff Daniels,” she responded flatly. The phone started ringing, and she glanced back inside at her desk—which from this distance at least looked as clean and organized as her car. The only exception was a metal ashtray full of what looked like wadded-up bubble gum wrappers.</p><p>“Look, can you excuse me a moment? My secretary called in sick today, and I’m a little busy here.”</p><p>“Sure, take your time.” Dean waited while she walked back to pick up the phone, and Sam didn’t have to look at his brother to know where his eyes were going. “Hey. What do you think she—“ Dean began.</p><p>“Stop,” Sam said. “Just stop.”</p><p>“I’m just saying, man, they write songs about this stuff.”</p><p>“They write songs about going to jail, too,” Sam said. “Let’s try to avoid doing that in the first ten minutes we’re here, okay?”</p><p>Sheriff Daniels finished her phone call.</p><p>“All right,” she said, staying on the far side of her desk, “let’s get to it.</p><p>“I’m going to be straight with you two,” she continued before either of them could speak. “In case you hadn’t noticed, I’m in the middle of a situation, and if I don’t come up with some answers, something’s going to hit the fan.” The phone was ringing again, but the sheriff made no move to answer it, “So if there’s something you need from me, make it fast.”</p><p>“By all means,” Sam said.</p><p>She gave them another look.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>“Let’s start with this guy Dave Wolverton, the...” Dean gestured vaguely, “what do you call them? Dress-up guys?”</p><p>“They’re called re-enactors,” the sheriff said. “If you call them dress-up guys, they’ll probably clean your clock for you.”</p><p>“Right. Sorry. Re-enactors. According to the report, Wolverton was playing the part of an actual Civil War soldier named Jubal Beauchamp, right? And he shot another dr... re-enactor on the field with a replica of a rifle?”</p><p>Daniels nodded curtly.</p><p>“A customized model of the classic Springfield musket, built to fire blanks.”</p><p>“How do you know it wasn’t real?”</p><p>“I know a replica when I see one.” She pointed at a chair off to the right. There was a rifle propped against it. “Like that one.”</p><p>“May I?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>He picked up the replica and hefted it in his hands.</p><p>“Feels pretty real to me.”</p><p>“Of course it feels real,” the sheriff said. “It’s an ounce-for-ounce recreation of the actual weapon. These re-enactors are intensely devoted to authenticity in every detail. They’re hardcore.”</p><p>“Yeah, so we hear,” Sam replied. “What happened to the actual bayonet and gun that Wolverton used on the battlefield?”</p><p>“They’re in the lab now. Getting tested.”</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “So maybe he just got a little carried away and decided the war was still going on? You know, maybe he was a little, I don’t know, unbalanced?”</p><p>Daniels sighed.</p><p>“Maybe you didn’t hear what I’m telling you. We’re talking about tax attorneys and IT guys who voluntarily choose to dress up in itchy wool uniforms and hobnail boots and do twenty-mile marches in ninety-degree heat. For fun. This is their idea of a good time.</p><p>“They’re not ‘a little unbalanced,’” she continued. “They’re certifiable. But they’re all carrying replica guns. I don’t care if you think you’re the ghost of Lee Harvey Oswald—you’re not killing somebody with a gun that only shoots blanks.”</p><p>“So you’re saying...” Dean started, but then he stopped, not knowing where he was headed.</p><p>“So I’m saying that, barring the existence of a wormhole in the time-space continuum which suddenly switched these replicas with real guns and live ammunition, there’s no way a weapon like the one Dave Wolverton was carrying yesterday could have possibly done anything like this.”</p><p>She opened a drawer in her desk, took out a manila folder and dropped it on the desk, glossy eight-by-tens falling out. Sam picked up the crime-scene photos of a corpse in a Union soldier’s uniform.</p><p>He passed the first print to Dean. Most of the head had been scalloped away just above the neck and was sprayed out around it. In full color, it looked as though somebody had spilled a particularly messy Italian meal across the grass.</p><p>The next photo was a close-up of another re-enactor with one eye gouged out, blood dried over the skin like a theatrical half-mask.</p><p>“Wolverton stabbed him with a bayonet,” Daniels said, nodding at the side table to the left of the desk. “Just like that one.”</p><p>Dean picked it up, turning it over in his hands, and tested the edge of the blade against his palm.</p><p>“You couldn’t cut Wonder Bread with this.”</p><p>“Gee, you think?” Daniels’ eyes, very green and sharp, flicked back and forth between them. Reaching into her desk, she pulled out a piece of gum, unwrapped it, and popped it in her mouth, then wadded up the wrapper and stuffed it in the ashtray.</p><p>“Look,” she said, “I know you two aren’t from around here. So here’s what I suggest. Go to the Historical Society, look at some old pictures, check out the battlefield, talk to some re-enactors—“</p><p>“We already did that,” Dean said.</p><p>“Good for you.” She took the gum out of her mouth, gave it a look as if it had somehow personally betrayed her, and wadded it up. Into the ashtray it went. “So we’re clear, then. Do your own homework, and let me get back to my job. If you come up with any intelligent questions, get back to me, okay?”</p><p>With that she turned her attention to the paperwork on her desk. Clearly the discussion was over.</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “Intelligent questions.”</p><p>Sam glanced up.</p><p>“I’ve got one.”</p><p>The sheriff looked up, gazing at him from the depths of bottomless indifference.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Wolverton stabbed himself to death with his own bayonet, right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So,” he pointed, “what are these marks around his neck?”</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>“Right here.” Sam tapped the photo, indicating Wolverton’s throat, where a pair of red friction-burns ringed the flesh. “Like bruises, see?”</p><p>“You’d have to ask the coroner.”</p><p>“You didn’t notice anything strange yourself?”</p><p>“Anything strange?” The sheriff arched one eyebrow. “Are you joking?” But Dean noticed that she didn’t actually answer the question.</p><p>“Maybe we should talk to the coroner ourselves,” he said.</p><p>“Be my guest. His office is two blocks away.” She glanced at her watch. “Tell you what—it’s getting late, but I’ll give him a call and let him know you’re coming.”</p><p>“Bruises.” Dean was still scrutinizing the photo. “Almost looks like he was choked or something. Right, Sam?”</p><p>When there was no immediate answer, he turned to look over his shoulder at his brother, expecting agreement, or at least a nod of acknowledgment.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>But Sam Winchester had done a very strange thing.</p><p>He had fallen utterly silent.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Okay,” Dean said as they walked down the sidewalk toward the coroner’s office. “You want to tell me what that was all about?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“I saw those marks around Wolverton’s neck, and I think... it triggered something in my mind.” Sam stopped and looked at Dean. “From that dream I had. But I don’t remember what it was.”</p><p>“You’re not holding back on me, Sammy, are you?”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Cuz you know, that never works out.”</p><p>“I know,” Sam said. “I just... it’s like whatever happened got erased.”</p><p>“Well, maybe a look at the corpse will help jog your memory.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>The Mission’s Ridge County Coroner’s office wasn’t much more than a steel doorway in the back of a long brown municipal building just off of Main Street.</p><p>Dean and Sam walked past a dumpster and a single vehicle that was parked there, a beige nondescript sedan with government plates. The ground alongside the building was littered with old lottery tickets and cigarette butts, as if someone had spent a long time watching his luck run out.</p><p>Dean tried the door.</p><p>“Locked.” He pressed the buzzer, waited a few seconds, and then started knocking on the wire-reinforced window. “Lights are off. Didn’t Sheriff Hottie say she was calling ahead?”</p><p>“Maybe the coroner’s gone home for the day,” Sam offered.</p><p>“Or maybe nobody wants to talk to a couple of Yankee boys asking tough questions.” Dean stepped back, evaluating the security keypad. “I’ve gotta say, I’m not feeling a whole lot of Southern hospitality here, Sammy.”</p><p>“And you’re the one who said, ‘I love the South.’” Sam glanced back in the direction they’d come. “What about the Historical Society?”</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“Maybe we should check that out before it gets any later.”</p><p>Dean frowned at him.</p><p>“You don’t want to see the body?”</p><p>“Door’s locked, Dean.”</p><p>“So was the vault at the Bellagio, but that didn’t stop Ocean’s Eleven.”</p><p>Sam gave him a look.</p><p>“I’m just trying to make the most of the time we have.”</p><p>“So you’re not scared of looking at those marks on Wolverton’s neck?”</p><p>“Scared?”</p><p>“Yeah, as in, nightmare?” Dean peered at him expectantly.</p><p>“I told you, I don’t remember.”</p><p>“And you don’t want to.”</p><p>“Hey, look,” Sam said, “if you want me to stay—“</p><p>Dean shrugged.</p><p>“Nope, you’re right,” he said. “You go ahead and see what you can dig up. Divide and conquer. Apocalypse freakin’ now.”</p><p>But Sam stood his ground.</p><p>“What’s this about, Dean?” he demanded. “Is it about you not trusting me? Because if it is, there’s not a whole lot of places we can go from there.”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re my brother,” Dean said. “But you’re also Lucifer’s prom dress, and if he’s seeding your dreams with hints about the master plan, then maybe it might be a good idea for you to look at ‘em as close as possible. That’s all I’m saying.”</p><p>“What I’m feeling aren’t hints, Dean,” Sam said, trying to explain as best he could. “They’re not clues—if anything, they’re preventing me from figuring this out. It’s more like getting jabbed in the brain with a cattle prod. So forgive me if I don’t go actively seeking it out.”</p><p>“Okay.” Dean took out his cell phone. “I’ll try the sheriff again, see if I can get her to come over and let me in herself. You do your historical thing, and we’ll hook up later and talk it out.”</p><p>Sam nodded, and left.</p><p>Dean stood by the door, watching his brother stride around the corner. There was no mistaking the swiftness of Sam’s gait. Whatever the nightmare had left in his mind, Dean knew Sam wasn’t ready to deal with it—not directly, anyway.</p><p>And when he was, Dean hoped it wouldn’t be too late.</p><p>Glancing at the wire-reinforced window in the door in front of him, he put away the cell phone and picked up a brick.</p><p>“George Clooney was a wuss,” he said, and raised the brick. He was about to swing it forward when the lock clicked and the door swung open.</p><p>Castiel blinked out at him.</p><p>“How long have you been in there?” Dean asked, quickly stepping inside. The coolness of the air conditioning was a relief from the stifling heat outside.</p><p>“I just arrived.”</p><p>“Hey!” a voice cut in. “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>Dean looked past Castiel, into the office, at an unshaven, thirty-something man in a white Oxford, sleeves rolled up to the elbows, tie tugged down. He’d been in the process of lighting a cigarette, which now dangled from his lower lip in surprise.</p><p>“Door was open,” Dean said.</p><p>“No, it wasn’t.”</p><p>“Are you the coroner?”</p><p>“Who’s asking?”</p><p>Dean badged him.</p><p>“Agent Van Zandt, FBI. This is Agent... Zevon.” Before Castiel could react, he continued, “Sheriff Daniels gave us the access number in case you were busy.”</p><p>The coroner regarded Dean and Castiel for a long beat, and the open door behind them, then brought his lighter to the cigarette and put a flame to its tip.</p><p>“My name’s Todd Winston. And yeah, I’m the coroner.” He inhaled and blew a stream of smoke from the corner of his mouth. “But Sheriff Daniels didn’t give you the combination to get in. She’s not a big fan of the Feds.”</p><p>“Well, gee golly gosh, Cletus, that just about burns me all up inside,” Dean said. “How about we stop worrying about the sheriff and you show me the dead body you got in there.”</p><p>Grumbling under his breath, Winston led them through the loading area and down the hall to a small office where he ducked inside. When Dean turned to look in after him, he saw that the walls of the office were packed floor to ceiling with books, most of them hardcovers still in their dustjackets.</p><p>Emerging again, Winston held a set of keys. He led them around the corner to another, even narrower hallway. A second doorway took them into a storage chamber illuminated from above with long glass florescent tubes that cast a cold declarative light over everything. While the rest of the building had been comfortably cool, here it was downright cold, and Dean was actually glad to be wearing a suit.</p><p>In the center of the room stood a steel table with a drain at the bottom, surrounded by cases of sterilized instruments and canisters of fluid and supplies. A bottle of drinking water sat off to one side, half-empty.</p><p>Dean paused, the old familiar smells of disinfectant and chemical preservatives pricking his nose. He waited while Winston put on a pair of latex gloves and a lab coat, then turned his attention to the far wall to take hold of a handle.</p><p>The coroner twisted the knob, braced himself and pulled out a seven-foot-long drawer, lifting the stainless steel flat-plate to reveal the bin itself.</p><p>“This your boy?” Winston asked.</p><p>Dean looked down. Pale and naked and somehow flattened, the corpse of Dave Wolverton looked even scrawnier and more pathetic than he’d anticipated. Despite his best efforts to dress and act like a Civil War soldier, it had, ironically, taken nakedness and stillness to complete the transformation. The stab wound on the underside of his chin had been cleaned and sutured, and the coroner’s traditional Y-incision was fresh enough that the flesh was still raw and pink where the shears had cut open Wolverton’s thoracic cavity.</p><p>Small divots of black hair tufted the young man’s skinny breastbone and the almost emaciated concavity of his belly. Here was a body that could very easily have come from an actual surgeon’s tent back in 1864.</p><p>Looks like he died hungry, Dean reflected, the randomness of the thought surprising him.</p><p>He found himself staring at Wolverton’s face, the sunken cheekbones and sagging lips. Even vacant and slack, the face had a strange leering quality that put him on edge. He realized that he didn’t want to spend any more time with the corpse than he absolutely had to.</p><p>“You find anything unusual in the autopsy?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not really,” Winston said.</p><p>“Toxicology report?”</p><p>“Not back yet.” He took another drag on his cigarette, then looked around for an ashtray. A used coffee cup fit the bill.</p><p>“You don’t do that yourself?” Dean asked.</p><p>Winston shook his head.</p><p>“Lab at the M.E.’s office takes care of that part, down in Waldrop City. Don’t have the equipment here.”</p><p>“Well, I guess that’s something to put on your Christmas list, isn’t it?” Dean bent down closer to examine the flesh around Wolverton’s neck, inspecting the bruises that Sam had first noticed in the photo. “What about these?”</p><p>“Twisting abrasions. Rope burns.”</p><p>“Where’d they come from?”</p><p>“Rope,” Winston replied, without a hint of humor. “Maybe some kind of cord.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said. “That clears that up.”</p><p>Winston didn’t seem to notice the sarcasm.</p><p>“There wasn’t anything wrapped around his neck when the sheriff brought the body in. No trace of fibers in the skin either. And you’d see those.”</p><p>“There are other ways of binding men’s souls,” Castiel said, leaning forward to touch the hematomas on either side of Wolverton’s neck. “Some forms of demonic bondage are not so easily detected.”</p><p>“Bondage?” Winston glanced at Dean. “What the hell’s he talking about?”</p><p>Castiel opened his mouth to answer, but Dean cut him off.</p><p>“Forget it,” Dean said. “Is there an inventory of what Wolverton had with him when he died?”</p><p>“Sheriff’s office is still typing it up.” He glanced at the doorway. “I just remembered, I gotta make a phone call.”</p><p>Without awaiting a response, he walked out, leaving Dean and Castiel alone with the corpse.</p><p>“Well, might as well give this a shot,” Dean said, glancing at his companion and reaching into his back pocket. He pulled out an index card and began reading the Rituale Romanum.</p><p>“Deus, et Pater Domini nostri Jesu Christi, invoco nomen sanctum tuum...”</p><p>“You don’t have it memorized by now?” Castiel asked, completely in earnest.</p><p>“I got sick of everybody correcting me all the time so I just wrote it down,” Dean said, and then he kept reading. “... et celmentiam tuam supplex exposco...”</p><p>Without warning Wolverton’s corpse jerked a little in the bin, hard enough that one hand twitched and fell palm-open, and the fingers quivered and twitched.</p><p>The corpse’s head rolled slightly to one side.</p><p>“...ut adversus hunc, et omnem immundum spiritum...”</p><p>“Something’s happening,” Castiel said.</p><p>Dean paused and glanced down.</p><p>Something black was emerging from Wolverton’s left ear. At first he thought it was some kind of fluid, and then he realized that it was alive. Tiny, cilia-like legs—dozens of them—wiggled around it. With weird, deliberate speed, the black thing began to scurry like a malformed cockroach across Wolverton’s pale cheek, as if making its way toward his eyes.</p><p>As Dean stared at it it stopped, frozen in place.</p><p>It’s looking at me.</p><p>The hairs rose up on the back of his neck.</p><p>That’s impossible, it doesn’t even have—</p><p>Then, with a high-pitched shriek, the black thing sprang upward, launching itself at Dean’s face.</p><p>He jerked backward on reflex and the thing hit the floor. He lunged and stomped on it, crushing it under his heel, then grimaced at the sticky stuff that spattered outward from the bottom of his shoe. The thing was still wiggling, pulsing furiously as it crawled upward, onto his ankle.</p><p>He could feel it sucking against his skin, pulling as it slithered upward toward his calf.</p><p>“It’s still moving!” Dean shouted. “Get it off!”</p><p>Without hesitating, Castiel picked up the bottled water. He closed his eyes, murmuring over it briefly, then dumped the water over Dean’s lower leg.</p><p>There was a smoking hiss and the thing gave another shriek. Dean felt it go limp against his skin. He yanked up his soaking wet pant-leg and saw nothing but a faint reddish mark just above his Achilles tendon.</p><p>Grabbing a piece of paper towel, he wiped the last of the holy water from his leg, wadded up the wet towel and tossed it in the trash.</p><p>“What was that?” he asked, trying to calm his own breathing.</p><p>“Moa’ah,” Castiel said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A kind of demonic afterbirth unique to this region of the American South.” The angel scowled. “I have not seen its like since the Civil War battlegrounds. When angels and demons skirmished over the souls of the dead.”</p><p>“And now it’s back,” Dean said, peering with disgust at the bottom of his shoe. “But why? And why Wolverton?”</p><p>Castiel looked at him.</p><p>“He was touched by the Witness.”</p><p>“So your Witness used this guy as some kind of demonic snot-rag?”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Castiel told him. “Moa’ah is a footnote in the Luciferian apotheca—one of its most obscure calling cards. It shouldn’t exist anymore. Its very presence here is a harbinger of the Apocalypse. And the Witness knows this. He wants us to know it.”</p><p>“And you’re looking for this guy?” Dean asked. “On purpose?”</p><p>“I need to find him.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Dean shook his head, “good luck with that.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>They found Winston back in his office, phone to his ear. Dean walked over and hit the ‘disconnect’ button.</p><p>“Hey!” the coroner snapped, leaping to his feet. For a second it seemed as if he might take a step closer, but then he saw something in Dean’s face that stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>“Who else was alone with that body?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You heard me. Besides yourself, who’s been back there?”</p><p>“Nobody. Sheriff Daniels, I guess. That’s about it. Whole thing happened right there on the battlefield, in front of God and everybody. If there was a rope around Wolverton’s neck, somebody would have seen it.” Winston sounded a little desperate now. “Right?”</p><p>“The rope is the least of your worries,” Dean said, glancing up at the ceiling. “You have surveillance cameras here? Motion detectors?”</p><p>Castiel looked at Dean.</p><p>“The Witness has full demonic powers. It could have passed through here entirely unnoticed.”</p><p>Winston’s eyes widened.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Bull. Anything that skeevy’s gonna leave a trace.”</p><p>Castiel shook his head.</p><p>“But—“</p><p>Dean cut in, turning back to the coroner.</p><p>“When does the toxicology report get back?” he asked.</p><p>Winston swallowed hard.</p><p>“Tomorrow, probably.”</p><p>“Did you find anything else out of the ordinary, inside the body or on his clothes? Any kind of markings or ritualistic burns and scars?”</p><p>“No.” But there was something in his voice.</p><p>“You’re sure?”</p><p>“Yes.” Winston stared helplessly down at the desk top. “Jesus, yes!”</p><p>Dean’s eyes flicked to the phone.</p><p>“Let’s see who you decided to reach out and touch,” he muttered, clicking ‘speaker’ and hitting the redial button.</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Winston pleaded. “You really don’t want to—“</p><p>“Oh, but I do,” Dean replied while the phone rang, and finally picked up. A woman’s voice came through the speaker.</p><p>“Hello,” she said. “It’s—“</p><p>Dean frowned at Castiel.</p><p>“Wait, I know that voice.” He glared back down at the phone. “Who is this?”</p><p>But the recorded voice on the phone had already continued talking.</p><p>“—Candy. Me and my friends are having a party in the jacuzzi but we lost our bikini tops, and now...” The voice began to sigh and breathe more heavily. “You just have to help us find them. Just enter a credit card number for three minutes of—“</p><p>“You know this woman?” Castiel asked.</p><p>Dean cut the call off mid-sentence and looked at Winston. The coroner’s face was blazing red now.</p><p>“The township better not have been paying for that call,” Dean muttered, turning to leave. “And we’ll be back to take a look at that toxicology report.”</p><p>“Sure,” Winston said. “Whatever. Just... how about a little warning next time, huh?”</p><p>“He was not lying,” Castiel said as they stepped outside into the gathering dark.</p><p>“I know,” Dean sighed. “Which leaves us with exactly bupkes.”</p><p>“Not necessarily.” They walked down the sidewalk beneath the streetlights. “Wolverton could have encountered the Witness on the battlefield, or—“</p><p>“Hold on.” Dean stopped walking. “You’ve been talking a lot about the Witness this and the Witness that. But if this Witness hung out with Jesus and it’s got a thing for nooses, that leaves me with about one guess.”</p><p>“And that is?”</p><p>“Judas. You’re hunting Judas.”</p><p>Castiel shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he said.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Judas was more concerned with temptation and betrayal than with bloody violence.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, if there’s one thing I know about humanity, it’s that betrayal can get pretty messy when there’s gunfire involved.”</p><p>Up ahead, Dean heard boisterous voices and laughter. He turned around, taking notice of their surroundings for the first time. They had stopped walking a block away from a massive old church, its planks looking as if they had survived centuries of warfare and harsh weather, like a shipwrecked battleship that had come to rest here.</p><p>Crowds of people in suits and dresses were pouring out of its high arched doorway.</p><p>“Is this a...?” Castiel asked.</p><p>“A wedding.” There was a burst of applause and cheers, and Dean watched as the bride and groom came down the church steps, heading in the direction of a limousine that was waiting at the curb.</p><p>She was wearing an antique wedding dress; he wore a Confederate soldier’s uniform so authentic that Dean could actually see clouds of dust rising from its shoulders.</p><p>“You’re kidding. They get married in this stuff?”</p><p>“Love is a battlefield,” Castiel said.</p><p>Dean stared at him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s a song I heard recently.”</p><p>Dean barely suppressed a smile and turned away from the angel.</p><p>“You’re something, Cass, you know that?” There was no response, and Dean paused without turning. “You just disappeared on me, didn’t you?”</p><p>Sure enough, when he looked back, Castiel was indeed gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam arrived at the pillared façade of the Mission’s Ridge Historical Society, having stopped by the Impala to discard his FBI jacket and tie. He climbed the granite steps to the front door, a slab of oak with an imposing iron handle, fully expecting to find it locked. Instead, it swung open on well-oiled hinges.</p><p>With a sense of coolness spreading over him, he stepped inside.</p><p>The entryway was windowless, darker than he’d expected, and the scrape of his feet echoed with a stony acoustic resonance that came from old places that had been left alone for long periods of time. He could smell camphor and old paper, canvas and mildew, and his eyes were still struggling to adjust.</p><p>For a moment he wasn’t even sure how big the entryway was.</p><p>“Help you?” a man’s voice asked behind him.</p><p>“That depends.” Sam turned, and a flashlight beam passed over his face, momentarily blinding him. “You work here?”</p><p>“I do,” the man said. “Sorry about the flashlight. Wiring troubles. She’s a lovely old building, but the electrical system can be a royal bitch, if you’ll excuse my French.” The man reached over to a fuse box embedded in the wall and fiddled with something inside for a moment. There was a loud clank, and lights came shuddering on.</p><p>“Ah, there we go.”</p><p>Looking up, Sam saw they were standing in a wide foyer. In front of him stood a man wearing an Atlanta Braves baseball cap, black t-shirt and faded Levis. He didn’t look much past his mid-thirties, but the first wrinkles of middle age had already settled around the corners of his eyes and mouth, giving his face a comfortable, lived-in look. The stubble on his jaw was a salt-and-pepper mix that gleamed a little in the light.</p><p>Next to him stood a young boy of perhaps eleven or twelve, also wearing jeans and a t-shirt—blond, fair-skinned, with wide, curious blue eyes that seemed to be taking in everything at once. The man held a huge, ancient toolbox, and the boy stood in unconscious imitation of the man’s pose, cradling a stack of thick hardcover books under one arm. There was no question that they were father and son.</p><p>“I’m Tommy McClane,” the man said, putting the tools down and wiping his right hand on his jeans before extending it to Sam. “This is my boy Nate.”</p><p>“Pleased to meet you,” the boy said formally.</p><p>Sam shook their hands, smiling faintly at the gravity with which the boy shuffled his load of books around so that he could offer his own small palm.</p><p>“You work for the Historical Society?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We are the Historical Society,” Tommy said wryly. “Old Pop Meechum used to run the place, but since his stroke laid him out, it’s just been me and Nate taking care of things.” He squinted a little. “You got a name, or should I just call you the Phantom Stranger?”</p><p>Sam smiled again.</p><p>“I’m Sam.”</p><p>“Sam it is.” Tommy McClane glanced down at his son. “Nate, why don’t you go put those in the library, see if there’s anything else we need to pick up in there. Meet us back in the museum.”</p><p>“Yessir.”</p><p>Tommy watched him go, then nodded back in the other direction.</p><p>“Come on back, why don’t you.” Picking up the toolbox, he sauntered down the corridor, then stopped again as something occurred to him. “You’re not from around here, I’m guessing.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So are you in town for this whole re-enactment bugaboo out by the creek?”</p><p>“You might say that.”</p><p>“Bunch of crazy rednecks running around the woods with toy guns, acting the fool,” he said, watching for Sam’s reaction. “Am I right?”</p><p>“Actually,” Sam said, “I think it’s pretty impressive, their commitment to authenticity. They’re like living historians.”</p><p>Tommy squinted at him a moment, then grinned.</p><p>“You’re all right, you know that.”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Y’see, you’re talking to one of those fools right now.” Tommy held up a hand, showing Sam a tarnished ring. “Confederate States of America. My great-grandfather wore this ring out on that very battlefield. Not that I support everything the South was fighting for, mind you. There wasn’t anybody happier than me to see an African-American in the White House. About damn time, I say. Nate and I drove up to DC for his Inauguration.</p><p>“But I’m still proud as hell of those men that laid down their lives in the line of duty, just the same.” He turned again and continued down the corridor.</p><p>Sam nodded and followed him, not entirely sure what to make of this man and his peculiar mix of backwoods erudition and self-effacement. Whatever the case, though, he’d already decided that he liked Tommy McClane. And at the moment he wasn’t exactly in the position to be picky about his allies.</p><p>“Well, listen,” Tommy said, opening a closet and putting his toolbox away, “I been running my gums a mile a minute, so tell me—what can I do for you?”</p><p>“I was hoping you could tell me about a Confederate soldier named Jubal Beauchamp.”</p><p>“Beauchamp?” Tommy glanced up, making no effort to hide his surprise. “What do you want to know about him for?”</p><p>“Well, I’m sure you heard about what happened yesterday with Dave Wolverton. He was playing the role of Beauchamp. I want to know if you have any information about him. The original soldier, I mean.”</p><p>Tommy peered at him for a long time, his expression impossible to read. He cocked his head slightly to one side.</p><p>“You’re not a cop, are you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Federal Agent?”</p><p>Sam took in a breath, meeting Tommy’s deep gray eyes. He knew this was probably his last chance to lie. Going on instinct, he shook his head.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Didn’t think so. So what’s your interest?”</p><p>“I...” Sam started, and realized he’d left himself without any options. “Let’s just say that what happened on that battlefield yesterday doesn’t have a reasonable explanation. And those are the kind of events that tend to get my attention.”</p><p>Tommy stared at him again for a moment, then burst out laughing.</p><p>“You’re a hunter,” he said, and slapped Sam on the shoulder. “Now it all makes sense.”</p><p>Sam stepped back, stunned.</p><p>“I’ve never heard your name before,” he said. “I haven’t heard about anyone working in this area.”</p><p>“I was expecting Rufus,” McClane said. “What happened to him?”</p><p>“Something came up. My brother and I stepped in.” Sam shook his head, still processing the information that the other man had given him. “So you’ve hunted with Rufus Turner?”</p><p>“Not actively. Hunting’s not exactly a life you want to share with a young kid, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“I do.”</p><p>“Nate’s mom died four years ago. Car accident, couple of teenagers out on a first date, everybody stone-cold sober—just about as accidental as those things can be. Nobody to blame and no survivors. It was hard on both of us, especially the boy. Getting through it, I realized how important it was to be around for him.” McClane shook his head. “Doesn’t mean I can’t keep my eyes and ears open, though, give a shout out to the hunters when things start looking nasty.”</p><p>“Is it nasty here?”</p><p>McClane gave a dark nod.</p><p>“See for yourself.”</p><p>Tommy led Sam through a warren of tidy, interconnected rooms, deeper into the building. Walking past rows of glass display cases, Sam caught glimpses of old pistols and muskets, yellowed documents, boots and uniforms, all carefully mounted and labeled beneath the track lighting. Every time he thought he’d reached Tommy, the man had moved on to the next exhibit.</p><p>Turning another corner, he finally caught up with him. Tommy had stopped in front of a display showing the first, second, and third National Flags of the wartime South.</p><p>“What kind of activity have you noticed around the town?” he asked the historian. “Was there anything unusual before the incident?”</p><p>“For starters?” McClane said. “Place is crawling with ghosts.”</p><p>“Metaphorically?”</p><p>McClane gave him a look.</p><p>“Do I look like the kind of guy who would say that metaphorically?”</p><p>“I just meant—“</p><p>“You see those train tracks running through town? Once upon a time the Confederacy had a train running right through Main Street and out to the battlefield. Had themselves a flatcar with a Gatling gun mounted on it, blasted the first wave of Union soldiers all to hell.” He nodded. “Train’s tucked away in the railway shed, but the tracks are still there. You listen at night, folks say you can still hear the whistle crying out.”</p><p>Sam cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>“There’s plenty more.” Tommy stopped and pointed around the corner. “Right through here.”</p><p>Sam followed him into a room and saw Nate waiting for them there. The library was a bright place with high ceilings and wooden bookcases lining the walls, a stepladder on rails, stretching up to the top. Oak reading tables and individual study carrels gleamed under rows of swan-necked lamps. Off to the left sat another desk full of neatly arranged computer equipment and a monitor. He saw several framed diplomas and certificates hanging on the wall.</p><p>“This is impressive,” Sam said. “Does the town pay for all this?”</p><p>“Folks around here take their history seriously,” Tommy said. And then, with a slight note of pride, “Me and Nate did a lot of the carpentry ourselves.” He reached out and tousled Nate’s hair. “Do me a favor, son, and pull down those folios up in the far right corner there, see ‘em? May 1863. Letters A to C.”</p><p>The boy nodded and scurried up the ladder, gathering a stack of volumes that looked as if they’d been bound in animal-hide and hauling them over to the table. Tommy lifted the cover and flipped through stiff pages so old that they crackled as he turned them.</p><p>“Jubal Beauchamp was a son of a bitch,” Tommy began. “Excuse me for saying so, but there’s no other word for it. He came up from Hattiesburg, about twenty miles from here, the only son of a Tennessee preacher who’d moved here on account of some kind of hijinks with his flock. Don’t know the particulars, but I can guess ‘em well enough, I suppose.</p><p>“Anyhow, Jubal was being groomed for the pulpit like his daddy, but just after seminary school, something happened to him that changed his way of looking at things.”</p><p>“You seem to know a lot about him,” Sam said.</p><p>“Let’s just say you aren’t the first hunter to come around asking about him. Dollar for dollar, it doesn’t get much spookier than Beauchamp. Lookit.”</p><p>Tommy pointed down at a smaller leather-bound diary that appeared to have been stitched directly into the spine of the larger volume.</p><p>“See this?” he asked. “Beauchamp’s private journal. Bought it off a collector in Louisiana back in ‘05.” Tommy opened it, and the smell that came out was even more like dead animal skin with a tincture of something more feral and pungent.</p><p>His tone became reverent.</p><p>“Want to see something really scary?”</p><p>Sam bent down to examine the lines of tight, neat handwriting that crawled over the pages. It was full of Scripture—lines that appeared to have been copied directly from the Bible, and what he could make out in between seemed almost mundane. There were notes Beauchamp had made to himself, lists of books and annotations of sermons and lectures.</p><p>“Now,” Tommy pointed, “look at this. May 1862. He leaves the seminary and joins up with the Confederate army.”</p><p>“The pages are blank,” Sam said.</p><p>“Only a couple of them.” Tommy turned further into the diary. “Here’s where it gets good.”</p><p>The difference was unmistakable. Beauchamp’s neat, tidy penmanship had become a shaky, almost violent scrawl, as if written while he was on horseback, or under the influence of some profoundly deranging psychotropic cocktail. Mixed in between were drawings, pentagrams and demonic insignias, that covered almost the entire page.</p><blockquote><p>Almighty one, Lord</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>of the Flies, Immortal</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Black Father, keeper of</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>goats, receive my offering</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>and bestow upon me the</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>full mantle of thy wrath.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Thine is the kingdom</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>and the power to come,</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>forever and ever.</p></blockquote><p>Sam blinked, and looked up at his host.</p><p>“It’s a desecration of the Lord’s Prayer.”</p><p>McClane stared at him.</p><p>“How do you know that?”</p><p>“These words here, they...” Sam began, and then he stopped. Looking down at the page, he realized that the text he’d been reading was written not only in an entirely different language, but in letters that didn’t remotely resemble the Roman alphabet.</p><p>Yet to his eyes they had automatically translated themselves.</p><p>Sam blinked again, feeling his pulse beating harder in his throat, until he could hear the blood thumping in his ears. Closing his eyes and opening them again, he looked down at the letters on the page and saw only an impenetrable forest of symbols.</p><p>“I don’t...” he managed, “I don’t even know how I read that. I don’t even know what language that is.”</p><p>“It’s Coptic,” McClane said, his voice sounding hollow with surprise. “It’s an extinct Egyptian language. Nobody speaks it—not anymore.”</p><p>“Well...” Sam swallowed, getting his bearings, “things have been a little different for me lately.”</p><p>“Sounds like it,” Tommy said warily. He regarded Sam silently for a moment, then seemed to come to a decision. “And speaking of different, check this out.” He dug deeper into the diary and pulled out a thick, stiff square of daguerreotype, holding it by the edges as he passed it to Sam. “This is the only known photograph of old Jubal.”</p><p>Sam looked at it. The photo showed a gaunt, hatchet-faced soldier in a dirty, ill-fitting uniform. His eyes were lost in the shadow of the slouch cap, though there was no mistaking the dark grin that had twisted its way across his face. Beauchamp looked like a man with a secret locked in his heart—one so black and eager with promise that, once released, there would be no stopping it.</p><p>Around his neck, he wore an old rope tied into a noose.</p><p>“Do you have a magnifying glass?” Sam asked, and then he glanced back at the computer. “Or better yet, a scanner. I need to see this close up.”</p><p>“Sure,” Nate piped up, and then he glanced up at his father. “Can I, Dad?”</p><p>“You know how to use it,” Tommy said, and the boy ran off with the old photograph, headed over to one of the computers that Sam had seen on his way into the library.</p><p>Once Nate was out of earshot, McClane bent closer to Sam.</p><p>“Listen,” he said. “There’re some more entries in that journal, stuff I haven’t been able to translate. Considering what you just did with that Coptic writing, maybe you want to take a look at it? See if you can make heads or tails of it.”</p><p>Sam flipped the next page of Beauchamp’s diary. By now the handwriting was so different that it had to have come from a different person entirely. The letters were twisted and sharp, freely intermingled with symbols and characters along the page, and yet—</p><p>Sam stared, he saw the lines transforming themselves, swimming a little across the stained pages, the letters themselves becoming somehow familiar.</p><p>“Someone else wrote this part,” he explained. “It says that Jubal Beauchamp was killed and brought back to life... through the powers of the noose...” He paused, wanting to get it right. “The man who did it was a Civil War doctor named Percy. When the doctor finished experimenting on him, he buried Beauchamp’s remains in an iron coffin, his spirit held fast by a spell from which it could not escape.”</p><p>When he looked up, Tommy was staring at him.</p><p>“You’re not just an ordinary hunter, are you?” the man asked.</p><p>“I—“ Sam considered a variety of answers, then just shook his head. “No.”</p><p>“Didn’t think so.”</p><p>There was a long silence between them, not quite awkward, but not comfortable either. Finally Sam spoke.</p><p>“I appreciate all your help with this.”</p><p>Tommy didn’t reply right away. Instead he scraped back his chair, turned and nodded around behind him at the doorway where they’d come in. Above it, Sam saw a small dark object not much bigger than a man’s hand attached directly to the wall above the entryway. He got up and looked more closely.</p><p>It was a bundle of what looked like hair or fur, wrapped carefully around an arrangement of roots and chicken bones.</p><p>“Hoodoo protection sigil,” Sam said. “Did you make it yourself?”</p><p>“I watch out over me and mine,” Tommy said evenly. “Don’t mistake my meaning. I’ve been to college. As I said, I’m not some backwoods autodidactic hillbilly. But this is the South. You’d be surprised what we see down here.” He considered Sam. “Or maybe you wouldn’t.”</p><p>“Does anybody know where Beauchamp was buried?”</p><p>“Nope. Folklore says that he and dozens of other soldiers were buried somewhere in a mass grave out on the battlefield. Unmarked and lost to time. Probably best left that way, if you ask me.”</p><p>“Thanks for the input,” Sam said.</p><p>Tommy McClane nodded. Something still seemed to be bothering him, however—a sense of restlessness that he couldn’t quite articulate. As Sam turned to go, he spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I know you’re a hunter, so you know what you’re getting yourself into, but this is bloody ground. I hope for your sake that whatever you’re doing, you’ll step lightly.” He took in a breath and let it out. “Some of this stuff isn’t buried too deep.”</p><p>“You know what Faulkner said about the past,” Sam said.</p><p>“Yeah. He said it’s not dead. It ain’t even past.” And then, brightening a little, Tommy added, “Leave me your phone number and email and I’ll have Nate send that scan to you as an attachment.”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“And hey.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You want to hear how the South really lost the war?”</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>“I’m not sure I—“</p><p>“Come on by the house after dinner, if you want. 440 Baxter Springs Road. We’ll sit out on the porch and drink iced tea and talk about spooks. Bring your brother...”</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, and he agreed.</p><p>The boy returned, putting the photo carefully back in its proper place, then the three of them wove their way back to the front door.</p><p>Sam waved goodbye to Tommy and Nate, stepped out into the night and down the front steps, and back through town.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The bar was small, crowded and smoky, with a pool table in the back. The Georgia Satellites were rocking ‘Battleship Chains’ on the jukebox at a volume just short of thunderous, while a mix of patrons in Civil War garb and modern-day clothing tried to find room to dance.</p><p>Behind the counter, a Confederate flag hung next to the mounted head of a buck. Someone long ago had tacked a handwritten sign on a paper plate above the deer’s head, proclaiming ‘Nice rack.’</p><p>“I’m guessing they don’t have wi-fi here,” Dean muttered across the booth. “I feel like I’m in the Star Wars cantina.”</p><p>Sam opened the laptop and looked over at him.</p><p>“Where’s Cass?”</p><p>Dean shrugged.</p><p>“Off on heavenly business, I guess.” He took a long drink from the glass in front of him, but the beer seemed to do him little good. “Here’s some shocking news. Dave Wolverton wasn’t just your typical airport restaurant waiter. I said a little of the exorcism right over his corpse, and stuff got messy in a hurry.”</p><p>“What happened?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Turns out that Cass’s Witness has itself a nice little calling card. Something called Moa’ah. Stuff went crawling up my leg. Cass had to burn it off with holy water.”</p><p>“Moa’ah?” Sam turned to the keyboard. “How do you spell that?”</p><p>“Gee, you know, Sammy, I forgot to look at its nametag.” Dean sipped his beer. “I’m fine, by the way.”</p><p>“Sorry. I just—“</p><p>“Forget it,” Dean said. “We’ll call Bobby and see if he’s ever heard of it. You find anything out at the Historical Society?”</p><p>“Well... if I can just get a signal... yes!” As he accessed his email Sam told his brother about the encounter with Tommy and Nate.</p><p>“Sonuvagun,” Dean said. “Well, at least your guy wasn’t a closet pervert. And it’s nice to have some help on this one.”</p><p>Nodding his agreement, Sam opened the email from Nate, downloaded the attachment, and turned the laptop around so Dean could see the old photo of Jubal Beauchamp.</p><p>“Here’s our guy,” he said. “The original guy.”</p><p>“And let me guess, that noose around his neck...?”</p><p>“—isn’t just any old noose.” Sam tapped a key, magnifying the image and correcting the resolution so the pixels sharpened into focus. Then he pointed. “What are these?”</p><p>“Knots?”</p><p>“They seem to have a specific arrangement of some sort.” Sam clicked on a link, bringing up a new window and an image of an old engraving of a rope twisted into complex interwoven patterns. “Have you ever heard of the Judas noose?” he asked.</p><p>Dean smacked the table with his palm.</p><p>“I freakin’ knew it.”</p><p>“Knew what?”</p><p>“Judas,” Dean replied, his voice low. “That’s got to be his Witness.”</p><p>“Listen to this,” Sam said. “According to the lore, if you could recreate the exact combination of knots that Judas used and place the noose over someone’s head, you’d release a strong demonic curse. Gives the wearer unholy powers, protects them from death... and eventually drives them mad. In the homicidal sense of the word.”</p><p>He hesitated.</p><p>“And there’s something else.”</p><p>“There always is.”</p><p>“I’m pretty sure this noose—whatever else it might represent—was part of the nightmare I had.”</p><p>“So it’s already in your head,” Dean said. “How do we get rid of it before it does a number on your sanity? It’s not like you’ve got a lot to spare.”</p><p>“I haven’t figured it out yet.” Sam lowered the laptop screen enough to meet his brother’s gaze. “But I’m guessing from the fact that you’re sitting here empty-handed that you didn’t find the noose at the coroner’s office, either.”</p><p>“Nope.” Dean picked up his glass, where the beer seemed to have disappeared almost against his will. “The coroner’s a tool, by the way. More or less useless.”</p><p>“Yeah, I gathered that,” Sam said. “So should we go back to the sheriff?”</p><p>Dean waved away the idea.</p><p>“Screw her,” he said. “She’s just as bad as he is.”</p><p>“No, Dean—“ Sam began.</p><p>“I mean it,” Dean pressed. “I’ve been thinking about it. Back at her office, she said ‘like that one.’ That means she didn’t have the actual weapons Wolverton used. So where’d they go? And why didn’t she want to help us, knowing we’re Feds?</p><p>“They’re probably in cahoots together. What’s more... “</p><p>“Dean, I’m trying to tell you, she’s...”</p><p>“Hot,” Dean said, “sure. Believe me, I wouldn’t kick her out of bed for eating crackers. But if you think I’m gonna give her a free pass on account of that—“</p><p>“No, I’m trying to say that she’s... standing right... behind you.”</p><p>A look of disgust covered Dean’s face. Slowly he turned around and saw Sheriff Daniels standing next to them, not two feet away, where she’d been listening to their entire conversation. She was glaring right at him.</p><p>“Were you saying something about Todd Winston?” she asked. “Please, continue.”</p><p>“Okay.” Dean nodded, stubbornly unrepentant. “How about, he’s a jerk and a sleaze? Do you even know the guy?”</p><p>“I ought to,” Sheriff Daniels said. “He’s my brother-in-law.”</p><p>“I should’ve known. Is everybody in this town related?”</p><p>“Not only that,” she said, “we’re all inbred racist hicks. What’s your point, Agent Townes?”</p><p>“He told me there’s no toxicology report available yet. It’s been almost twenty-four hours. What’s going on with that?”</p><p>“This isn’t New York or Los Angeles, Mister Federal Agent,” she said dryly. “Things move at a more languid pace down here.”</p><p>“Languid, huh? Good SAT word.” Dean glanced across the room. A girl who couldn’t have been much older than eighteen was slow-dancing with a biker twice her age. He was wearing a Mojo Nixon t-shirt, and both his hands were cupping the swell of her buttocks as she ground against him. “Seems like some of it moves pretty fast.”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?” she said, turning to look.</p><p>“Nothing. Forget it.”</p><p>“Well, here’s a word for you,” Sheriff Daniels said turning back and pinning him with another glare. “Judge. As in, ‘judge not, lest ye be judged.’” She smiled then, making a completely unconvincing show of hospitality. “Enjoy your stay.”</p><p>With that, she turned on her heel and left.</p><p>Sam and Dean were leaving the bar, on their way to the Impala, when they heard the voice behind them. Turning, they saw a young Rebel soldier step into the streetlight, walking toward them in full uniform, complete with a slouch cap.</p><p>The guy couldn’t have been on the legal side of twenty-one—he was pale and skinny, his cheekbones high and sharp. As far as lack of nourishment went, he almost looked too realistic. A lot like Wolverton’s corpse. For a second Dean wondered if he was actually seeing a ghost, the revenant of a dead Confederate soldier.</p><p>Then he noticed the gray coat’s iPod.</p><p>Approaching them, the young man removed the white earbuds. Dean caught a faint buzz of electric guitars before the soldier switched it off and gazed at them with pale blue eyes.</p><p>“I saw you two talking to the sheriff back there,” he said. “Are you investigating what happened to Dave Wolverton?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Sam said. “You knew him?”</p><p>“You could say that.”</p><p>“Look,” Dean cut in, “no offense, Billy Yank, but it’s late and we’ve had a long day. If you can tell us anything that might help...”</p><p>“I lived with him,” the soldier said. “For almost a year.”</p><p>“You mean roommates?”</p><p>“We were dating.”</p><p>“You and Wolverton?”</p><p>The soldier removed the slouch cap. Dean found himself staring as the hairpins came out, releasing a fluid tumble of brown hair that framed the angular face, immediately changing the subtle geometry of the cheek-bones, eyes and lips. The skinny, somewhat effeminate male soldier in front of him had just transformed into an attractive young brunette.</p><p>“Wow,” Dean said, not at all sure how he felt about this. “Okay.”</p><p>“My name is Sarah Rafferty,” the woman said. “Dave and I actually met at the TGI Fridays at the airport where we both worked about a year and a half ago. He’s the one that got me into all this.”</p><p>“That’s... cool. I guess?”</p><p>“Crazy as it sounds,” the woman said, “there’s actually an historical precedent. There were some women on both sides who put on uniforms and fought alongside the men, sometimes as drummer boys or powder monkeys, or even infantry. Not many, but a few.”</p><p>“So you and Dave were together,” Sam said. “For how long?”</p><p>“A year or so. He started coming into the restaurant talking about all this stuff. After a while I caught the bug. I was actually a communications major, but I minored in American History. Eventually Dave asked me to go to a re-enactment up in Gettysburg, and I was hooked.” She smiled a little at the memory. “He liked that it was our secret. Even the other guys in the 32^nd^ didn’t know that I was a woman.”</p><p>“So were you two still involved when he died?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sarah shook her head.</p><p>“I broke things off a couple of months ago.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“It was Dave—he changed. I mean, for a while I was legitimately impressed, how intensely he focused on nailing every detail with absolute authenticity. But something was just different. He wasn’t Dave anymore. He was Jubal Beauchamp all the time. It was like he had disappeared into the persona.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“There were problems at work. With the customers, I mean. We work in an airport restaurant, so we have people from everywhere. Dave would start talking to them about the Confederacy, and how the South should have won the war. It didn’t exactly go over well.”</p><p>“Ouch,” Dean said.</p><p>“They had to fire him. But Dave didn’t care. He said it gave him more time to concentrate on his real work.”</p><p>“Being Jubal Beauchamp?” Sam said.</p><p>“That’s right.”</p><p>“Yikes,” Dean said. “Single white Confederate.”</p><p>Sam shot Dean a look, and turned back to Sarah.</p><p>“Did you notice any one particular moment when it all changed?”</p><p>“Actually,” Sarah said, “that’s why I’m here. After it ended, I started trying to figure out where it all went wrong.</p><p>“Dave and I came to Mission’s Ridge about three months ago, for a wedding. One of the guys in the 32^nd^ was getting married at the old Pentecostal Church in town.”</p><p>“I saw someone else getting married there today,” Dean said.</p><p>“They do it all the time,” Sarah said. “The re-enactors love to use that church because it’s the only building in town the Union Army didn’t burn down when they marched through Mission’s Ridge. Phil Oiler, did you meet him?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>“Insurance salesman from Atlanta. He was the one getting married, and of course he wanted to do it in full uniform. So we all suited up for it, the 32^nd^ Georgia in full parade dress.” She paused, her expression darkening. “Except sometime between the ceremony and the reception, Dave and Phil disappeared.”</p><p>“Disappeared where?”</p><p>“That’s just it, nobody knew. For almost an hour they were just gone. Of course the bride was furious, because the photographer was out front and everybody was standing around waiting to go to the reception. Then, at the last minute, they showed up again like nothing had happened. People thought they were out getting high.</p><p>“But Dave didn’t do that.” She drew in a breath and let it out slowly. “That night at the reception was the first time I noticed how different he was. He started asking me to call him Jubal. I thought he was drunk, but it just kept happening. His accent got stronger. He started getting rough with me... when we were alone. And the things that came out of his mouth—they were awful. A couple of weeks later, I couldn’t take it anymore. I packed up and moved out. Then when I heard what happened yesterday...” Her eyes shone. “I had to come back here.”</p><p>“In full uniform?” Dean said.</p><p>The woman paused, weighing her words carefully.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to Phil,” she said at last. “I thought maybe he might be able to tell me more about what happened to him and Dave in the church that day. And, of course, I couldn’t come to him as Sarah Rafferty. I had to be Private Will Tanner.”</p><p>“Did you talk to Phil?” Sam asked. “Did you ask him about what happened at the wedding?”</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“He said that he and Dave just went down to the basement to smoke a joint.” Her blue eyes flashed brighter now, flinty with anger. “He was lying to me. And now Dave’s dead.”</p><p>“Did you talk to the sheriff?”</p><p>“I tried to. She’s not interested. I don’t understand. I thought... I guess I thought if I came clean and told her the truth about Dave and me, that she might dig a little deeper and help me figure out what went wrong. But it’s like she’s on some whole other mission.”</p><p>“Like what?” Sam asked, his curiosity piqued.</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s like she knows more than she’s letting on... like she’s after something.”</p><p>Sam and Dean traded a look, neither of them speaking for a moment. Then Sam turned back to Sarah.</p><p>“What exactly did the sheriff say to you?”</p><p>“Well, I told her about what happened at the church. She was really interested in that. But when I couldn’t answer any of her questions, she just lost interest.” Sarah frowned. “Why, do you think she’s got something to hide, too?”</p><p>“It’s too soon to say,” Sam said.</p><p>“Look,” Sarah said. “If you know something, you have to tell me. I cared for Dave. I want to know the truth.” She reached up and rubbed her eyes. “That’s why I thought maybe the two of you—I mean, I heard you say that you were Federal Agents, so...”</p><p>Sam touched her arm.</p><p>“We’ll do what we can. In the meantime, if you think of anything else, don’t talk to the sheriff. Come directly to us.” He handed her a card with his cell phone number on it.</p><p>“I will.” She glanced down at the slouch cap, still gripped in one hand. “You know my secret now anyway.”</p><p>“In the morning,” Dean said, “we’ll go back out to the battlefield and talk to Phil Oiler about his wedding day.”</p><p>“Thank you both.” She held out a slip of paper. “Here’s my cell.”</p><p>“We’ll be in touch,” Dean said, grabbing the paper. As they walked back to the car, Dean glanced at the number again and exhaled deeply, puffing out his cheeks with a long, exhausted sigh. “What a day. Right now all I want to do is go back to the motel, crack open a nightcap and watch a little Casa Erotica.”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Not tonight, Dean.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“I’ve got some people I want you to meet.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam called Bobby on the way out to the McClanes’ house, giving Dean directions while he asked Bobby about the Judas noose and the Moa’ah. There was a long pause and he heard pages rattling in the background.</p><p>“Looks like the noose is part of Civil War lore from the beginning,” Bobby’s voice came back. “There’re even songs about it.”</p><p>“What about the Moa’ah?”</p><p>“From what I can figure, it sounds like you’re talking about two sides of the same coin. Down in that particular region of the South, Moa’ah’s the animating force behind every bad kind of mojo you can imagine. Like the fuel that makes it go. Sounds like your dead Civil War soldier must’ve gotten some on him when he wore the noose.”</p><p>“So even if the noose itself is gone...” Sam started.</p><p>“The Moa’ah sticks around. Yeah.”</p><p>“So what do we do to stop it?”</p><p>“For now, nothing. Just stay the hell out of its way till I get a better handle on the info. I’ll call you back as soon as I’ve got something.”</p><p>“Thanks, Bobby.” Sam cut off the call and turned to Dean. Then he noticed that the Impala had slowed down enough that he could see individual pebbles and blades of grass in the headlights. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“We’re lost,” Dean said. “Gotta be.”</p><p>“No, we’re not.” Sam pointed straight ahead through the windshield. “Tommy gave me directions. Take a left here. Look—up on the hill.”</p><p>“Tommy, huh? Sounds like you two got pretty chummy.”</p><p>“Well...” Sam said. “When he found out that we were hunters...”</p><p>Dean’s head swiveled to stare at him.</p><p>“Wait a minute,” he said, his voice growing louder. “You told him? What’s the point of having a cover story if you’re gonna...?”</p><p>“Hold on, it’s all right,” Sam said, cutting him off. “I didn’t tell him—he figured it out himself. He’s the one who called Rufus.”</p><p>“Sure, that’s what he told you—“</p><p>Sam felt himself getting hot under the collar.</p><p>“Sorry, Dean, but I didn’t have my portable polygraph test on me at the time.”</p><p>“That’s the point—you’re not supposed to need one,” Dean replied, refusing to back down. “Never trust a stranger, Sammy, that’s Demon Hunting 101. Suppose this McClane guy was dropping Rufus’s name to get to us. Now we’re walking in there blind, and he already knows everything about us.”</p><p>“Not everything,” Sam said.</p><p>“What, you didn’t get around to telling him that you jump-started the Apocalypse? Give it time—he’ll figure that out, too.”</p><p>“Fine, I’ll tell you what,” Sam replied, “I’ll call Bobby back and ask if he knows him. That’ll prove he’s on the level.”</p><p>“Forget it,” Dean grumbled, “we’re already here.”</p><p>Sam turned and peered through the windshield, into the beams of the headlights. They were curving along a circular drive, and the plantation house spread itself above them, half-lost amid the cottonwoods and willows that draped over it like mourners at a viewing. It was a hopeless ruin, but he could see what the place must have looked like in its heyday, back when the flaked paint had been fresh and the high imposing Doric pillars stood straight and tall.</p><p>Now everything sagged, wings and cupolas giving way to gravity, and the entire structure seemed to be sinking slowly into the Southern soil. It was as if Tommy McClane and his son had devoted all their energy to the town’s Historical Society, but at the expense of maintaining their own family homestead.</p><p>There was a light on back in the house—dimly visible through the broad windows—and a lamp hanging on the porch, its flame flickering in the thick evening breeze.</p><p>Parking next to a big black Ford Ranger, they got out and looked up at the long porch that ran along the entire front of the house. Two figures were sitting there, gazing back down at them, lit only by lamp light. He could smell the rich mossy odor of the swamp somewhere nearby.</p><p>“Mr. McClane?” Sam called up.</p><p>“Sam,” Tommy said. “Glad you decided to take me up on the invitation.”</p><p>They walked up the creaking front steps to where Tommy and Nate were sitting on cane-backed chairs. Both had been reading, Sam saw. Tommy held Tony Hurwitz’s Confederates in the Attic, while Nate was gazing raptly down at what Sam realized was an electronic reader. It cast a ghostly light on his features.</p><p>“Kid’s a reader, what can I say?” Tommy asked, by way of explanation. “When I was his age I was reading Batman comics. But he asked for a reader for his birthday, and now I can’t get him to put it down.”</p><p>“Tommy, this is my brother Dean,” Sam said.</p><p>“Pleased to meet you,” Tommy said, holding out a hand.</p><p>“Quite a place you’ve got here,” Dean said, accepting the handshake.</p><p>“Been in my family for five generations. We were gonna sell, but then the bottom dropped out of the real estate market, so I guess we’re stuck here.”</p><p>“What are you reading there?” Dean asked the boy.</p><p>Nate grinned a little sheepishly, held up the reader so Dean could see. Hammer of the Gods.</p><p>Dean’s eyebrows went up.</p><p>“You like Zeppelin?”</p><p>“I tried to get the kid to listen to Allmans, Skynyrd...” Tommy shook his head. “Lost cause.”</p><p>“Zeppelin’s the best,” the boy said. “I’m reading the part where they’re partying in the Riot House in L.A., throwing furniture down into the pool.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“You know half the stuff in that book is bullcrap.”</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s still pretty good.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Dean grinned. “It is.”</p><p>“You want a glass of iced tea?” Tommy asked, nodding to the Mason jars sitting on the table beside them. “Or something stronger? I got beer in the fridge.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t say no,” Dean said.</p><p>“Help yourself. It’s straight back through the door, last room on the right.”</p><p>Dean opened the screen door. Stepping inside, he was immediately struck by the sheer size of the house around him, an ancient and somehow majestic shipwreck of a mansion that was much too large for the man and his son. The rooms he could see were lavishly appointed with worn furnishings, tables and lamps and Georgian antiques that looked like they could’ve sold at auction for thousands.</p><p>He wondered if anything significant had changed since the McClanes’ ancestors had lived there.</p><p>Passing through the arched kitchen doorway, he opened the fridge and took out a bottle of Beck’s. Turning, he glanced up and noticed the broom above the door.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>What the hell...?</p><p>There was a small cloth bag mounted over the doorway he’d just stepped through. And another, nailed up over the window to his immediate right. In fact, from where he stood, he could see that every point of entry was marked with some small, easily overlooked item—a bundle of chicken bones tied together with hair, a scrap of rawhide wrapped around a bunch of feathers and animal teeth.</p><p>You idiot. You walked right into this. Without so much as a knife to protect yourself—</p><p>Slowly, without making a sound, Dean set the unopened beer on the counter. He felt wide-awake, absolutely alert. Walking silently back in the direction he’d come, he automatically started evaluating all possible exits and weapons.</p><p>By the time he got to the screen door and heard Tommy McClane laughing, his heart was beating fast.</p><p>What happened next would depend on how hard McClane wanted things to be for him.</p><p>“What people don’t realize about a battle like Bull Run,” Tommy was saying, “was how much the original eyewitness reports of what happened—“</p><p>He stopped, as Dean stepped up from behind.</p><p>“Don’t move,” Dean muttered over his shoulder, and he tossed the Impala keys to Sam. “Get the car and bring it around. Knife’s in the usual place. Get it.”</p><p>“Dean, wait.”</p><p>“There’s hex bags all through here. Place is a freaking death trap.”</p><p>“Dean, wait.” Sam stood up. “The McClanes aren’t possessed,” he said. “It’s hoodoo.”</p><p>“Those charms you saw are household protection symbols,” Tommy said, sounding surprisingly calm. Looking back at Dean, he scowled a little incredulously. “Were you actually gonna stab me with my own barbecue fork?”</p><p>“It was the only thing I could find,” Dean mumbled, laying it aside, then turned to Sam. “What else did you forget to tell me?”</p><p>“You were already suspicious. I didn’t want to make it worse.”</p><p>“Yeah, well...” Dean fumed. “I left my beer inside.” As he stepped back into the house, he thought he could feel McClane’s eyes burning into his back.</p><p>Gotta be my imagination, he thought. That’s just a stupid cliché.</p><p>When he got back to the porch, Nate had switched off his e-book, and he and Sam were listening to Tommy McClane’s theory of how the South really lost the war.</p><p>“This business with the noose,” McClane said, “that’s just part of it. By the last year of the war, Lee’s armies were desperate. Soldiers were using all kinds of Louisiana voodoo on the battlefield. Hell, in the end, the CSA practically sanctioned it. Benign stuff at first... charms for protection and herbal remedies. Brought over by the slave trade, absorbed across the color line into local culture, including the poor white farm boys who were out there dying on the front lines.</p><p>“And by that point, the Confederates were using everything they could to try to hold off the Union.” He shook his head. “Except it was backfiring all over the place. Here in Mission’s Ridge, for example, in the battle they’re re-enacting this week, the South was winning. And then all of a sudden, without any explanation, Confederate troops started turning on each other, and on themselves. The history books treat it like it was some kind of insurrection, a fatal breakdown in the chain of command. But it was more than that. It was a damn massacre and the town fell to the North because of it.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Dean said. “Jubal Beauchamp was right smack in the middle.”</p><p>“And he was wearing the noose,” McClane said. “No doubt in my mind.”</p><p>“So where is it now?” Sam asked.</p><p>Tommy McClane looked up at them wearily.</p><p>“Wherever it is,” he said, “good riddance. There’s a reason why I’ve got protection charms over every door and window in my house.”</p><p>“Have you ever heard of something called Moa’ah?” Dean asked.</p><p>Tommy flinched visibly at the mention of it.</p><p>“Where did you hear about that?”</p><p>“Let’s just say I got to see some of it up close and personal,” Dean said.</p><p>“That’s impossible. If you came across the Moa’ah, you wouldn’t be sitting around talking about it.”</p><p>“Well, I had help.”</p><p>“You really think it’s that powerful?” Sam asked.</p><p>“It’s inside the noose.” Every trace of good humor had fallen away from McClane’s face. “And those knots were tied in Hell.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Their motel room was painted blue and gray.</p><p>Half of it was decorated with old photos of Union soldiers and paintings of the Yankees. The other half was decorated with Rebel flags and replicas of Confederate artifacts. An imaginary Mason-Dixon Line divided the space cleanly between two sagging single beds.</p><p>“You want Lee or Sherman?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“North or South?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer, just climbed on one of the beds and lay on his back with his hands locked behind his head, staring straight up at the ceiling fan as it paddled the humid night air.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Sam set up the laptop on the desk and went online, running an image search on different types of nooses. In the quiet, he could feel the slow tension boiling off his brother until finally it became something he could no longer ignore.</p><p>Sam turned around and looked at Dean.</p><p>“Dean? Is there something you need to say to me?”</p><p>Dean didn’t move. “Nope.”</p><p>“So you’re just going to lie there and watch the fan spin all night?”</p><p>“I was thinking about brushing my teeth.”</p><p>“Come on. If you internalize one more dark thought, you’re going to explode.”</p><p>Dean sat up fast, the shadows under his eyes making him look simultaneously exhausted and bursting with nervous energy.</p><p>“Your buddy McClane talks about Hell like he did time there. Meanwhile I could give him a freakin’ guided tour of the place.”</p><p>“He knows about the noose,” Sam said.</p><p>“And that’s another thing. What does he really know? History’s not my strong point, and personally I could give two craps about who lost the war and why. I’m here to smoke this thing, whatever it is, and get out of Dodge.”</p><p>“It’s not that simple.” Sam stood up from the desk. “What’s this really about? McClane or me?”</p><p>Dean stopped pacing and faced him across the room.</p><p>“It used to be about us, Sammy. You and me and Bobby, and that’s it. Now it’s you and me and whoever you feel like trusting on any given day. And frankly I’m not so crazy about that.”</p><p>“Well, it’s a little late to cut him out,” Sam said. “So for the sake of getting this figured out, let’s focus.”</p><p>Sitting back down at the computer, he added, “Take a look at this.”</p><p>He clicked back to the digitized image of Jubal Beauchamp that showed the hangman’s knot around his neck. Dean stepped up beside him and stood, arms crossed, peering down.</p><p>“Beauchamp’s rope had six coils around it, the standard technique. Right?”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“It says here that the more loops you make, the more the friction increases on the rope.”</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“But if you look at this picture—“ Sam magnified the Beauchamp image, squinting at the grainy pixels. Centering on the noose, he looked closer. “there’s a seventh coil.”</p><p>“Riveting. Really.” Dean returned to the bed. “So where does that get us?”</p><p>“We need to go out there in the morning and talk to Oiler again. Find out exactly what he saw—what happened at the wedding. He has to be holding something back.”</p><p>“And this time he’ll definitely tell us the truth.”</p><p>“No,” Sam said, “he’ll prevaricate and lie and try to cover up, just like everyone else is doing. But we’re going to lean on him—just you and me—until he levels with us.” He turned and faced the bed. “Because I, for one, am sick of feeling like we’re not getting the whole story here.”</p><p>Dean studied his brother’s face, saw cold steel in his eyes and wanted to believe in it.</p><p>“And then what?”</p><p>“And then we find this thing,” Sam said, “and we deal with it.”</p><p>Dean didn’t say anything.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes and listened to the silence.</p><p>Far off in the distance he heard the scream of a train whistle.</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Outside of town, night fell over the battlefield, its full weight sinking fast over the star-rattled sky.</p><p>Campfires dotted the hillside where the men bivouacked, re-enactors on both sides hunkered in front of their tents, drinking from tin cups, scraping food off plates, talking in the hushed tones of men away from their families and homes. Corncob pipes were produced, muskets disassembled and lovingly cleaned and oiled by lantern-light, the old rituals brought out and pored over one more time.</p><p>Here and there cell phones shone between the trees like blue fireflies as one man or another sneaked a quiet call to a wife or girlfriend.</p><p>Private Terry Johnson sat in front of the fire with his banjo, plucking out the first plaintive notes of ‘My Old Kentucky Home.’ He played softly, almost to himself, unselfconsciously. It was late now, and most of the 32^nd^ had already bunked down for the night in preparation for the long march in the morning.</p><p>The only other sounds were the crackling of the fire and the nickering of the several dozen horses corralled near the cavalry troops, as the animals too settled down for the night.</p><p>“Know any Coldplay?”</p><p>Johnson flinched a little in surprise and stopped plucking. Phil Oiler—also known as Norwalk Pettigrew, of the 32^nd^ Georgia—sat down on a stump next to him.</p><p>“Oh,” he said. “Hey, Phil.”</p><p>“Call me Norrie.” Oiler leaned his musket against one of the big stones that formed the fire-pit and brought out his bayonet, wiping it with a chamois. “That was my guy’s nickname.”</p><p>“Cool.” Johnson started to put the banjo aside, and Oiler stopped him.</p><p>“No, man, keep playing. In the camps that was what kept the men’s spirits up.” Reaching into his jacket, he brought out a dented metal flask, removed the cap and held it out. “Whiskey?”</p><p>“Thanks.” Johnson tipped it back and took a sip, letting it burn. It was good, smooth stuff, probably not what the boys on the battlefield had sipped a hundred and fifty years earlier, but who knew? This was the South, after all. Maybe it was even better then.</p><p>“Much appreciated.”</p><p>“That’s an authentic Civil War flask, by the way,” Oiler said. “1860s.”</p><p>“Pretty cool.”</p><p>“Set me back a pretty penny, but it’s worth it.” He fell silent, regarding the flask in the firelight. “You know any more songs?”</p><p>“Just a handful, really. ‘Foggy Mountain Breakdown,’ and the first part of ‘The Rainbow Connection,’ that’s about it.”</p><p>Oiler sighed and placing the bayonet on a piece of cloth sat back in the flickering firelight.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Johnson picked listlessly at the banjo while casting about for something to say. He was relatively new to the 32^nd^, having only joined up a few months earlier, after his wife left him for some orthodontist that she’d met online. The loneliness had driven him to seek out men with similar interests. He didn’t know Oiler very well, except that the man sold insurance and had a family somewhere in Atlanta.</p><p>Oiler, for his part, didn’t seem to mind the silence. He passed the flask back again, nodding his encouragement, and Johnson took another pull of whiskey. All around them the night intensified, gaining bulk and breadth until the hillside and trees and everything outside the campfire’s immediate glow was rendered in varying shades of blackness.</p><p>“Almost feels like 1863,” Oiler said, “doesn’t it? So still...”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Here, let me show you something,” Oiler said. He sounded different now, his voice soft and strange. The fire crackled and popped hypnotically in front of them.</p><p>“What is it?” Johnson asked.</p><p>Oiler didn’t answer right away. For a moment the flames guttered low, dropping them into near-total darkness.</p><p>When the fire brightened again, Johnson thought he saw something around the other man’s neck, just for an instant. Then it was gone, a trick of the shadows. He rubbed his eyes.</p><p>It has to be the whiskey, he thought. I’m seeing things.</p><p>“Phil...”</p><p>“Call me Norrie.” Oiler was smiling now. “Did you see it?”</p><p>“Did I see... what?”</p><p>“I know more about Jubal Beauchamp than what I let on,” Oiler said. “A lot more.”</p><p>“You mean Dave?”</p><p>Oiler shook his head and smiled.</p><p>“He let me try it on for myself, you know—around my own neck. And it felt good.”</p><p>Johnson stood up a little unsteadily. Maybe he was drunker than he thought.</p><p>It was time for bed.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re going?” Oiler’s voice asked gently.</p><p>“I—I’m just—“</p><p>Sudden, shocking pain exploded through his foot, erupting up his leg. Looking down, he saw that Oiler had jammed his bayonet down through his boot, impaling his foot directly into the ground.</p><p>Before Johnson could even scream or get loose, Oiler yanked the blade free and landed on top of him, clapping a hand over his mouth and pinning him to the ground, holding him in the dirt with the full weight of his body.</p><p>Johnson fought to get free, but Oiler was too strong. One of them kicked over the banjo in the struggle, knocking it into the fire where it emitted sour little blunks and twangs. Then Oiler’s face was right next to his, close enough that he could feel the other man’s chin-stubble scrape against his cheek and smell the whiskey on his breath.</p><p>There’s no noose around his neck, Johnson thought dizzily. There’s nothing there at all.</p><p>“War is hell,” Oiler whispered in his ear.</p><p>He seemed impossibly strong, an instrument of coiled muscle. Vaguely, through his agony, Johnson realized that smells were pouring off the other man’s skin in waves: alcohol, tobacco, and something else, the stink of a moldy old cellar. “Welcome to it.”</p><p>“Please,” Johnson muttered into the other man’s palm.</p><p>“Put this in your mouth.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>Johnson looked down and saw the bayonet poised just below his chin.</p><p>“Please. No.”</p><p>Oiler slammed the blade’s tip upward, cracking Johnson’s teeth. He gagged as the oily metal invaded his mouth, pain spiking deep as the sharpened edge sliced through his lips and tongue. His sinuses began to fill with salty warmth. All his life he’d wondered what went through men’s minds as they faced death. Now he understood.</p><p>His thoughts circled back to his parents and his estranged wife and his sister in New Jersey, and all the things he’d never done and would never get to do. He tried to talk but his lips couldn’t form the words beyond a few desperate whining sounds. Tears flooded his eyes, spilling down his cheeks.</p><p>Above him, the stars had lost their shape—they shivered and streamed like mad planets against the outer wall of a universe that no longer made any sense.</p><p>Still pinning him, Oiler whispered something, speaking words in some other language that Johnson couldn’t understand.</p><p>He felt the blade jerk forward.</p><p>And then nothing.</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and Dean awoke to the wail of police sirens coming from somewhere outside the motel room, howling down the pre-dawn streets of Mission’s Ridge. Dean climbed out of bed and drew back the heavy curtains to reveal daylight just starting to raise a bleary eyelid on the horizon.</p><p>“That’s never good,” he said, and he glanced at Sam. “This is supposed to be a quiet little burg.”</p><p>“Sounds like they’re heading west.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“I’m thinking the battleground.” He nodded toward the bathroom. “You want the first shower?”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>Moving with practiced efficiency, they got dressed in their FBI suits and went out to the Impala. Pulling onto the road, they headed west, stopping at a convenience store for coffee on the way. Twenty minutes later they swung up into the parking lot outside the battlefield. The sky overhead was a bloody, cloud-streaked ruin with mile-long bars of darkness and bronze raked across it from horizon to horizon.</p><p>“We should’ve come out here last night,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean gulped a scalding mouthful of coffee.</p><p>“Would it have made a difference?”</p><p>They got out and started walking across the dew-damp grass. Through the early morning mist, Sam could already see the yellow tape flapping around the tents of the 32^nd^ Georgia. Confederate and Union re-enactors milled outside the police barricades, trying to get a look at the crime scene.</p><p>Dean pulled one of the Confederate soldiers off to the side, away from the rest, while Sam tried to see what was happening beyond the crush of bystanders. Just as he was ready to give up, Dean stepped back over.</p><p>“One of the guys found ‘em out there when he got up to drain the snake,” he said. “That was about an hour ago. They’d been lying out there most of the night. Phil Oiler and friend.”</p><p>“Damn.”</p><p>Pushing through the crowd, they waved their badges at a cop who was about to protest, then made their way through the rows of blue-and-red flashing emergency vehicles lining the edge of the hillside. Approaching the tent, they stepped over the tape and walked toward the two long gray bags sitting on either side of the darkened fire-pit.</p><p>Sheriff Daniels was hunched over one of the body bags, zipping it up. The expression on her face was one of stiff and implacable distaste.</p><p>“Sheriff?” Sam called out.</p><p>She didn’t bother looking up at them. State police and local emergency medical technicians were re-directing foot-traffic, ordering people back in the loud impersonal voices of those who did these things for a living. There was a sharp click from overhead, and a voice—heavy with Southern twang—came from the loudspeakers that were mounted along the perimeter.</p><p>“Attention. This is Sergeant Earl Ray Harris of the Georgia State Police. Due to the events of last night, the rest of the re-enactment has been canceled. Please gather your belongings in an orderly fashion and vacate the premises immediately.”</p><p>Why the hell would they do that? Sam wondered. This is still an active crime scene...</p><p>A communal groan came from the hundreds of men bivouacked out on the hillside, and the groups began to dissipate. Looking back at the crime scene, Sam saw Sheriff Daniels coming toward him carrying a canvas tote bag.</p><p>“Sheriff—“</p><p>“Not now.” She pushed past them without breaking stride, the bag swinging at her side. As it nudged her leg, Dean thought he heard something inside making a clinking sound.</p><p>“Come on,” Dean said, nodding at the bodies by the fire-pit. “Before they haul them off.”</p><p>He and Sam approached the EMTs just as they were placing the body bags on stretchers, and Dean badged them with a perfunctory flick of the wrist.</p><p>“Federal Agents Townes and Van Zandt. Mind if we take a quick look?” Without waiting for permission, he pulled the zipper down on the nearest bag, widening it until he could make out the face inside. It was a man in his early twenties, with dried blood splashed around his mouth and chin like some grotesque attempt at clown makeup, his blank eyes bugged open almost comically in butcher-shop burlesque.</p><p>“You recognize this guy?” he asked his brother.</p><p>“No,” Sam responded. “But I know this one.”</p><p>Dean glanced at the second body, and immediately identified the man as Oiler, the bull-shouldered re-enactor they’d interviewed the previous day.</p><p>“My guess,” one of the EMTs was saying, “is that Oiler stabbed Johnson, then cut his own throat. Must have kept it quiet, commando-style. Nobody in the tent heard any screams.”</p><p>“Got an extra set of gloves?” Sam asked, and the EMT tossed him a pair. Sam reached down and turned Oiler’s head sideways.</p><p>“Dean?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Check it out.”</p><p>Dean squatted down next to him, and they both looked at the red rope-burns around what was left of Oiler’s neck.</p><p>“Was there something around his neck when you found him?” Sam asked the technician. “A rope or something?”</p><p>“Not that we saw,” the EMT said. “But we just got here. The sheriff was on the scene for half an hour before we arrived. You might want to ask her.”</p><p>“That’s a heck of an idea,” Dean said, and stood up, looking at Sam. “You ready?”</p><p>Sam nodded. But he was gazing off into the middle distance, where a group of figures in Confederate uniforms were hitching a wheeled cannon to the back of a Ford Bronco. Glancing around, he prodded one of the re-enactors standing beside him.</p><p>“What are those guys hooking up to their truck?</p><p>The man squinted.</p><p>“Looks like a siege howitzer. It’s a rifled-cannon.”</p><p>“What’s it shoot?”</p><p>“The real thing? Whatever you put in it. Solid shot, grape, canister, shell, even chain shot—that’s two balls connected by a chain. Like getting slammed head-on with the devil’s own hairy beanbag.” The man sounded envious. “We’re talking badass.” He shook his head. “‘Course, that one up there wouldn’t fire a thing.”</p><p>“So it’s a replica?”</p><p>The re-enactor snorted.</p><p>“Let’s hope so. Otherwise they’d be driving off with an authentic wartime relic. That’s a Federal offense—but you know all about that, don’t’cha.” He gestured back at the crime scene, where the EMTs were picking up the stretchered bodies. “Can you believe this?”</p><p>“Guess I have to,” Sam said. “Are you leaving?”</p><p>“No way. None of us are. Not until we find out who did this.” The re-enactor met Sam’s gaze, and Sam saw deep determination there, as if the man and his fellow soldiers were genuinely at war. “Some of those guys were my friends.”</p><p>“Sam!” Dean shouted, already halfway to the parking lot. “You coming or what?”</p><p>Sam went after him. When he looked back at the battlefield, the men in gray were hooking a second howitzer up to the back of a pickup truck.</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Reporters were already clustered in front of the sheriff’s office when Sam and Dean got back into town. The only available parking was two blocks away, between two TV news vans. Backing the Impala toward the curb, Dean checked the rearview mirror and saw Castiel sitting in the back seat, looking at him.</p><p>He jumped a little reflexively and slammed on the brakes.</p><p>“Damn it, Cass, how many times do I have to tell you, don’t  that.” Sam jerked round in his seat.</p><p>“You have to get out of here,” Castiel said.</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“There’s some extremely heavy demonic activity gathering in the area. You both need to be as far away from it as possible.”</p><p>“Right,” Dean growled, “running from demons, ‘cuz that’s exactly how we roll.”</p><p>“You don’t understand.” Castiel sat forward, gripping the seatback with both hands until Dean could hear the springs in the upholstery creaking. He spoke with an intensity that made each word hiss like molten iron plunged in cold water. “I thought I could identify the source of the Moa’ah. But you’ve been drawn back here as a trap. The Witness is closer than ever.”</p><p>“Judas, right?” Sam asked. “That is who we’re talking about, isn’t it.”</p><p>“Yes,” Castiel admitted.</p><p>“Then why didn’t you say so before.”</p><p>The angel shook his head.</p><p>“At first it didn’t make sense, that so powerful a Witness would be involved in a simple local skirmish.”</p><p>“And now it does?”</p><p>“Judas is the custodian of the noose. He and his minions are compelled to be here in Mission’s Ridge because someone has reactivated the noose’s power. And they are not happy about it.”</p><p>“How do you know all this?” Sam asked.</p><p>“The knowledge was placed in my head.”</p><p>“By...?”</p><p>Castiel regarded him with absolute earnestness.</p><p>“By the only one capable of such things, I presume. God Himself.”</p><p>“You know, Cass, God’s told a lot of crazy people to do a lot of crazy things, and some of ‘em aren’t so nice.”</p><p>“There’s more.”</p><p>“Swell.”</p><p>“You’re not the one they want.” Castiel turned to focus on Sam. “Whoever’s behind this is forcing your hand, Sam. Using the Judas noose to speed up the Apocalypse clock. They’re trying to create a situation where you have no choice but to become Lucifer’s vessel.”</p><p>Before Sam could respond, Dean spoke up again.</p><p>“Of course, the Almighty didn’t bother telling you how this is gonna happen, did he?” he said.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Sounds more and more like Him all the time.” Dean glanced at his brother. “You ready?”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“Dean, wait,” the angel said, his voice almost pleading.</p><p>“Sorry, Cass. Never been good at that.”</p><p>He and Sam climbed out of the Impala and started walking up the sidewalk toward the crowded entrance of the sheriff’s office.</p><p>“You realize he’s probably right,” Sam said, without looking over at his brother.</p><p>“Uh-huh.”</p><p>“But we’re going in anyway.”</p><p>“You got an issue with that?”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“If they want me bad enough, they’ll just come after me anyway.”</p><p>“So we hit first,” Dean said, “and hit hard.”</p><p>They arrived at the entrance to the sheriff’s office and pushed through a throng of reporters and spectators gathered outside the entryway. The door itself was locked.</p><p>Dean took out his badge and rapped it sharply on the glass. From inside, the sheriff’s deputy—a paunchy man with a cartoonishly thick black moustache—looked up at them then down at their badges. He came over and unlocked the door.</p><p>“Sheriff here?” Dean asked, as they slipped inside.</p><p>“Yeah, but you don’t want to interrupt her right now.”</p><p>“It’s important,” Dean said. Across the office he could already see Daniels at her desk, phone clamped to one ear, almost yelling into the receiver.</p><p>“I don’t give a damn what they’re telling you,” she was saying, “I want them cleared off that battlefield now. Those men are contaminating my crime scene.”</p><p>“Your crime scene?” Dean strode up to the desk and stared at her until she was forced to look up and acknowledge him. Then she just turned away, trying to find somewhere else to fix her attention.</p><p>Dean moved with her, holding eye contact. She glared back at him, and finally ended the conversation, hanging up the phone.</p><p>“What do you want?” she demanded.</p><p>“Where’s the noose?”</p><p>“The what?”</p><p>“Phil Oiler was wearing a rope around his neck when he died last night, and now it’s gone. You were the only one around before the EMTs showed up. You’ve been withholding information this whole time. So where’s the noose?”</p><p>The sheriff’s face went very white, except for a red patch on either cheek. Her lips tightened, and Dean could see a small blood vessel throbbing high up on one side of her forehead.</p><p>“Get out of my office,” she gritted.</p><p>“Not yet.” Dean didn’t move.</p><p>The vein in her head pulsed harder.</p><p>“I’ve got two hundred Civil War re-enactors refusing to pack up and let me do my job out there. I don’t need you two clowns making things worse.”</p><p>“We’re not leaving until we get some answers,” Dean said.</p><p>“Oh, I’m getting answers. In fact...” Her lips turned slightly, forming into a thin and totally humorless smile, “I’ve got the Atlanta field office of the FBI calling me back right now. That is where you two said that you were from, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said, “but—“</p><p>The phone on Daniels’ desk started ringing again.</p><p>“Here we are.” She picked it up. “Hello? Yes sir. This is Mission’s Ridge Sheriff Jacqueline Daniels calling. Sorry to bother you, but I’ve got two men here claiming to be Federal Agents, and I just wanted to verify their identification.”</p><p>“Wait,” Sam said. “Let me talk to them.”</p><p>“Not a chance.” Daniels shook her head and turned her back to them. “Yes, sir. Agents Townes and Van Zandt. That’s right, V-A-N Z-A-N-D-T. Thanks. I’ll wait.”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean, and saw that his brother was staring straight at the sheriff.</p><p>Except he wasn’t.</p><p>He was actually staring at a nylon tote bag that rested in the corner of the office. It was the same one Daniels had carried away from the crime scene. Dean was staring straight at it, as if he could somehow see inside through sheer force of will, or levitate it into the air.</p><p>Daniels smiled, and spoke into the phone again.</p><p>“Yes, sir. I appreciate that. Thank you for your time.” She shook her head. “Jerry?” she shouted.</p><p>The paunchy deputy who had let them in came around the corner.</p><p>“What’s up, Sheriff?”</p><p>“Please escort these two men to the holding cell. The charge is posing as a law-enforcement official.” She smiled again, this time directly at Dean. “We’ll have plenty of time to figure out who they are later. Meanwhile they can rot in the drunk tank.” She glanced out of the window. “And haul their piece of crap car to the impound lot. I don’t want it cluttering up my street.”</p><p>“Whoa!” Dean snapped, a sudden rush of anger rising in his face. “Watch your damn mouth, lady. You can’t just—“</p><p>Jerry pivoted on them with unexpected intensity. His paunchy, thickly moustached face didn’t look soft or easygoing anymore. A new type of hardness had spread over his expression now, and his hand was resting on the butt of his sap.</p><p>“Easy or hard, gentlemen. Makes no difference to me.”</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, “look...”</p><p>“Hard it is, then,” Jerry said, drawing the club from his belt. Suddenly he looked like a man who enjoyed using it on vagrants, bums, and anyone else who got in his way, whenever he had the chance.</p><p>“Wait!” Sam said, holding up his hands, palms out.</p><p>That was all he managed to get out before a bomb burst across the sky. It shook the windows of the sheriff’s office as it exploded.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The explosion caught Sheriff Daniels and her deputy completely off-guard. They both spun around in reaction to the noise.</p><p>Dean saw Jerry lowering the sap, and that was all the opportunity he needed.</p><p>“Come on!” he shouted. Barging past the deputy, he sprinted out of the office, through the lobby, and out the door. Sam was close behind.</p><p>The front steps of the sheriff’s building were still cluttered with reporters and camera crews, but they were all facing the other way, toward the outskirts of town, where a second roaring explosion had just gone off, spitting aftershocks across the horizon.</p><p>“What is that?” Sam shouted.</p><p>Dean jabbed a finger off beyond the low buildings of downtown Mission’s Ridge. The sun was up now, and lay behind them.</p><p>“It’s coming from out by the battlefield.”</p><p>Scrambling down the sidewalk, he bolted across the street and down the block to where the Impala sat waiting, then jumped behind the wheel almost without waiting to see if Sam had made the trip along with him.</p><p>But Sam was already there, climbing into the passenger seat.</p><p>Dean gunned it, and the Impala’s engine roared to life with a reassuring throb that seemed to say, What took you so long? Its wheels laid sizzling parabolas of rubber across the concrete as the car spun forward and went shooting off toward the outskirts of town.</p><p>Behind him, Dean could already see blue and white lights swirling in the rear-view mirror.</p><p>“Looks like them Duke boys are fixing to get themselves in a heap of trouble again,” he muttered in his best Merle Haggard drawl.</p><p>Sam checked his side-view mirror.</p><p>“Can’t you drive any faster?”</p><p>Dean grinned.</p><p>“No. But I can do this.” He threw the wheel hard to the right, sluicing the Impala’s back-end around at a ninety-degree angle, sending them straight into the ‘Dixie Boy Buggie Wash.’ One of the attendants—a skinny guy in a lawn chair—jumped out of the way far enough for Dean to drive completely into the car wash. Water and wet sponges splashed off the windshield, enveloping the car, and Dean craned his neck enough to watch the sheriff’s cruiser go flying up Main Street in the direction of the explosions.</p><p>“I think we lost ‘em.” Another explosion echoed off in the distance. “And here I thought the re-enactment was canceled.”</p><p>“I don’t think this is a re-enactment,” Sam offered.</p><p>“Then what the hell...” Dean stared, looking over, and the words faded on his lips. His brother was holding a small, bloodstained leather satchel on his lap, tugging loose the strip of rawhide that acted as its drawstring. “What’s that?”</p><p>Sam held it up.</p><p>“I snagged it out of the sheriff’s tote bag on the way out the door.”</p><p>“Not bad, Sammy,” Dean said. “Did you happen to see the noose in there, too?”</p><p>“I didn’t exactly have time to look.”</p><p>“Crap.”</p><p>Dean pulled out of the car wash, waved to the attendant on the other side, and slammed the accelerator again, sending the Impala shrieking around the narrow alleyway.</p><p>“Man, that bag stinks. What’s in there, anyway?”</p><p>“Check it out.” Sam removed a tarnished silver coin, holding it up to examine its markings.</p><p>“Confederate?”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Older than that, I think.” He took out his phone and snapped a picture of it. “I’ll send it to Bobby and see if he can help identify some of the markings.”</p><p>He did so, then continued, “Judging from these bloodstains, and the fact that this leather smells like gastric bile—“</p><p>“I’m not even gonna ask how you know that—“</p><p>“—I’m guessing it came from somewhere inside one of those bodies out on the battlefield,” Sam finished.</p><p>“So what, the rope-curse sends you psycho, then pays you for it?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Crazy.”</p><p>“Dean! Look!” Sam pointed up ahead, perhaps a mile into the distance, where a huge cloud of black smoke was rising up into the sky. “Still think it’s a re-enactment?”</p><p>“We gotta get out there.”</p><p>“If the sheriff sees us...”</p><p>“I think she’s got her hands full right now,” Dean said, and he floored it.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Another explosion rocked the earth underneath them as they jumped out of the Impala and chased their shadows across the parking lot. Sirens were rising up all around them in the distance. The smoke was already thick enough to sting their eyes and make their noses water.</p><p>In front of them, the entire Mission’s Ridge battleground seemed to be on fire. Men in Confederate and Union uniforms—hundreds of them—were scurrying in all directions, heading away from burning tents and enormous smoking craters that had opened up in the well-manicured grass like giant angry mouths.</p><p>The police cruisers in the parking lot were dispensing local cops and state troopers, the officers yelling into radios and trying to be heard above the chaos.</p><p>“The shooting,” Dean shouted, “where’s it coming from?”</p><p>Sam pointed across the creek and up the hillside, perhaps a thousand yards in the distance. At the top of the hill, a row of SUVs and pickup trucks were parked overlooking the gorge below. Standing alongside them was a phalanx of siege howitzers like the ones that they had seen earlier. Two figures in uniform—at least they seemed to be in uniform—were packing ordnance into the rifled cannons.</p><p>“Look out!” He winced as one of the howitzers blasted, its projectile shrieking downward over the hillside and across the creek, where it slammed into the earth with a deafening BOOM! Great chunks of rock, dirt, and splintered tree roots sprayed up into the air and came showering down everywhere.</p><p>“I thought they were replicas!” Dean shouted.</p><p>“They are!”</p><p>“Then how—“</p><p>THOOM! Another shell slammed close enough that Sam actually felt the ground lurch up and go sideways under his feet. Before he knew it he was on his knees, his mouth and nose clogged with soil and flecks of stone.</p><p>When his vision cleared, Dean was hauling him to his feet, brushing him off, yanking him back.</p><p>“You okay, Sammy?”</p><p>“I’m all right,” he managed, wiping a stream of blood from his eyes. He was weak, dazed—the pores of his skin felt like they’d been packed with flying debris—his first instinct was to find safety, but running away wasn’t an option right now, and he knew it.</p><p>“We’re gonna get killed out here!” Dean shouted. “They’re shooting at us!”</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>Sam spun around, regaining his bearings, trying to take in the full scope of what was happening around him—to make it make sense somehow. Groups of re-enactors were streaming in every direction, trying to find their way back to the parking lot through the clouds of flying dirt and dust.</p><p>Up ahead, the corral of cavalry division horses were going wild with panic, bucking and trying to get free from their pen.</p><p>There were some binoculars lying in the grass next to a tent, and he scooped them up. Bringing them to his eyes, he squinted until the details came into view.</p><p>And he saw them.</p><p>The men loading the howitzers were indeed dressed in uniform, some Confederate, others Union. As Sam stared at them, they seemed to sense that they were being watched, and one of them turned and looked right back at him.</p><p>The man grinned.</p><p>His eyes flicked to total black.</p><p>The cannons roared again, three at a time now, filling the air with an explosion so loud that it seemed to blot out every other sound on earth.</p><p>“Damn it, Sam, we have to go now!” Dean screamed at him, but this time Sam hardly heard him. “They’re gonna blow us up!”</p><p>“That’s the least of it,” Sam said. “They’re demons.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“See for yourself.” He thrust the binoculars at Dean and waited while he stared through them.</p><p>Then Dean seemed to become very calm. He reached backward under his shirt, drawing a blade from its sheath.</p><p>“How many, you think?”</p><p>“Three, maybe four.”</p><p>“Two each?”</p><p>“Sounds good.”</p><p>“You want the blade?”</p><p>“No, I’m good.” Sam shook his head. “You take it.”</p><p>Dean frowned.</p><p>“You’re not gonna go all ‘Dark Sam’ on me, right?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Sorry. Too soon?”</p><p>“Dean—“</p><p>“Fine.” Dean nodded. “I get it. We’re good.”</p><p>Sam shook his head. He honestly couldn’t tell how serious his brother’s queries were. And at the moment he didn’t care. He was simply—almost absurdly—relieved to have Dean fighting alongside him.</p><p>Tromping uphill through the choking cloud of smoke, with artillery rounds booming through the landscape below them like some cataclysmic percussion instrument, Sam almost lost sight of where he was going. Above them artillery rounds pierced the air. For a span of several minutes it seemed like every few yards he gained, another explosion sent him skidding back down the embankment, until he had to sink his fingers into the earth and claw his way to the top.</p><p>Glancing over his shoulder, he caught a brief glimpse of the battlefield below. Ambulances had arrived in the parking lot, their roof-lights pulsing through the airborne debris. Cops and paramedics were moving forward between the craters, trying to get the injured re-enactors out of harm’s way. Nobody seemed to be in charge, and if they were, nobody else seemed able to understand them.</p><p>Near the top, Sam and Dean stopped and fell motionless, gasping hard for what little air there was close to the ground. Sam’s ribs ached from the exertion. From here he was looking straight up at the undersides of the cannons, each one recoiling violently as it fired another round. He glanced over, trying to gauge his brother’s state of mind.</p><p>Dean’s face looked flush but triumphant—in his mind he’d already won this battle, or perhaps he was just happy to be fighting demons instead of bureaucratic red tape.</p><p>“How do you want to...?” Sam started, but Dean was already in motion, springing up over the top.</p><p>Scrambling to follow him, Sam was just in time to see his brother dive forward and plant Ruby’s demon-killing blade into the first of the fusiliers.</p><p>The demon sparked and flashed white, its meat-suit collapsing. Yanking the blade loose, Dean whipped around and flattened the soldier behind him with a roundhouse Billy-Jack kick. Even on its back, though, the thing was faster than Dean was, springing upright and grabbing hold of his leg, jolting Dean forward.</p><p>The blade went spinning into the grass.</p><p>Sam grabbed the knife and drove it straight down into the demon’s skull. The bone burst like crockery and it fell howling to the ground, vomiting up shrieks of rage and agony as it flashed out, the blade sticking out of its head.</p><p>On the other side of the howitzers, the two remaining demons—one garbed as a Confederate, the other in a flat-crowned Union kepi—turned to charge them.</p><p>“I feel like we’re fighting a Disneyland ride,” Dean muttered, getting to his feet. “You still have the knife?”</p><p>Sam gaped at him. “I thought you picked it up.”</p><p>The Confederate demon opened its mouth in a twisted, wide-jawed grin and lunged at Dean as if it intended to swallow him whole. Sam heard his brother let out an involuntary “uff!” of punched-out breath as the demon fell on top of him.</p><p>Behind him on the hillside, the siege howitzer that the demon had been loading stood ready to fire. Its fuse was hissing steadily down to the barrel. Vaguely—in a distracted, secondhand way—Sam noticed that it was gleaming with fresh blood.</p><p>“Sam Winchester?” a thick voice said.</p><p>Sam turned and saw the Union demon standing in front of him, holding the demon-knife.</p><p>“We’re not interested in you,” the demon said, with all the intensity of an IRS auditor going over a list of deductions. “Let us do our work here and we’ll be on our way.”</p><p>“What work is that?” Sam demanded.</p><p>When the demon didn’t answer right away, Sam realized that, for better or worse, he was going to have to act. He lunged for the demon, and it swung the knife at him in a scooping, desultory arc. Sam dodged left, recoiling, and felt the tip of the blade snag the fabric of his shirt as he sprinted around in front of the howitzer. The hillside dropped off sharply underneath his feet and he fell to his knees, starting to slide. But the Union demon kept its footing, raising the blade to deliver the killing blow.</p><p>“You should have stayed out of our way,” the demon said. “It would have been much simpler.”</p><p>Directly behind the demon, the howitzer roared. At the last second the thing seemed to realize what was happening, but it was too late. Sam shut his eyes as the entire upper half of the demon’s body disappeared in a sulfurous spray, drenching him from above.</p><p>Sam reached up and, by sheer luck, caught the blade in mid-air. It was an astonishingly cool move, which of course meant that there was no way his brother could have seen it.</p><p>And Dean hadn’t.</p><p>Because he was too busy getting the unholy snot beaten out of him by the last remaining demon on the hill.</p><p>Sam flung himself toward it. He could hear the faint gargling noises that his brother was making as the demon went about the business of strangling him.</p><p>Hearing him coming, the demon snapped around and glowered at Sam, onyx-eyed and seething with fury.</p><p>“You wouldn’t dare intrude on this,” he said, “if you knew the mission we were given.”</p><p>Sam flicked his wrist, throwing the knife at the demon’s face. The creature laughed and ducked easily, so that the blade went whistling over his head, landing in the dirt.</p><p>“We serve a greater purpose here.” Releasing Dean, the demon stalked toward Sam, managing to look both heavy and impossibly graceful in its human meat-suit. “You’re only one part of that.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, you don’t serve any purpose at all,” Sam responded. He realized that he wasn’t shouting anymore. He didn’t have to. The guns had fallen silent.</p><p>From down below, a smell was rising up the hillside on the breeze. It was indescribably foul and rotten, as if tons of flyblown decaying flesh had been left out to bake in the sun.</p><p>“You wait,” the demon told him. “Just wait. The way our numbers have waited, for so very long, suffering in the darkest hollows of—“</p><p>“Don’t you ever shut up?” Dean shouted hoarsely from behind it, with what sounded like genuine exasperation. “You want us so bad, quit talking and kill us already!”</p><p>“An excellent idea, Dean Winchester.”</p><p>The demon in the Union uniform pivoted and strode back toward him, taking two steps, then three, then freezing when it saw the ground beneath its feet, where Dean had used the knife to carve a Devil’s Trap into the grass.</p><p>“Dumbass,” Dean muttered, and he started muttering the exorcism rite.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After the exorcism, the smell of sulfur just got worse.</p><p>“Ugh, what did they open up down there?” Dean asked, gazing down between the howitzers at the smoldering battlefield below. He covered his nose and mouth with one hand and fanned the other in front of his face, as if he could somehow sweep a hole of clean air into the thick fumes that were accumulating around them.</p><p>“Smells like...”</p><p>“I know,” Sam said. “And it’s only getting worse.”</p><p>Mortar shells from the cannons had torn the battlefield to shreds, uprooting trees and opening dozens of holes across the acreage. Through huge clouds of dirt and dust, he saw emergency personnel and state police—and probably the sheriff too, he thought glumly—gathered around one of the craters, peering down into it.</p><p>Long shafts of sunlight poked down from the clouds above in almost palpable pillars, as if God himself was taking an interest in what had been unearthed there. Although it was hard to say from this distance, Dean thought he saw debris down inside the hole, mixed in with the rocks and roots of trees. And from the reactions of those standing around it, they seemed to be seeing it too.</p><p>He noticed something else, as well.</p><p>“Didn’t that train used to be inside the shed?”</p><p>Sam looked down on the other side of the creek, to the steel rails that ran across the battleground. Far off to the left, an 1850s steam locomotive sat in front of a railway shed. Its engine, coal car, and caboose were in full view, as well as the artillery field piece, a Gatling gun mounted to the flatcar.</p><p>“Part of the re-enactment?” Dean asked hopefully.</p><p>“Then how come we didn’t notice it before?” Sam countered. “Kind of hard to miss.</p><p>“That demon said he was serving a bigger purpose,” he added. “I don’t think they were trying to kill anybody. I think they were making holes. Trying to get down to what’s in that hole in particular.” He shrugged. “If they got those cannons working, who’s to say they couldn’t stoke up an old steam engine, as well?”</p><p>Dean was looking back out along the hillside, fixating on something in the middle distance.</p><p>“I want a closer look.”</p><p>“The sheriff’s down there,” Sam said.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“We’re not FBI anymore, remember?”</p><p>“I’ve got a plan.”</p><p>“Why doesn’t that surprise me?”</p><p>“Hey.” Dean clapped his shoulder. “Where’s the trust?”</p><p>Sam was about to answer when he felt his phone vibrate in his back pocket.</p><p>“Hold on.” He checked the screen. “It’s Bobby.”</p><p>“Not now.”</p><p>“This could be important.” Sam watched his brother rubbing his neck where the demon had tried to strangle him. “And are you really gonna tell me you couldn’t use a breather?”</p><p>“Fine. Five minutes—tops.” Sighing, Dean found a relatively secluded spot behind a pile of rocks and squatted down to watch the action below while Sam answered the call.</p><p>“Hey, Bobby.”</p><p>“Sam?” Bobby didn’t bother hiding his concern. “You sound winded, kid. Everything all right?”</p><p>“Dean and I just took out a demon kill-squad.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, I got news about that.”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>“That coin you sent me a picture of,” Bobby said, “is a shekel of Tyre—an ancient Phoenician coin. It’s one of the thirty silver pieces that Judas got for betraying Christ. Where’d you get it?”</p><p>“Inside one of the victim’s bodies,” Sam said.</p><p>“Were you the one that found it?”</p><p>“I got it from the sheriff’s office, but—“</p><p>“Sam, this is important. Did the sheriff know you took it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t think so. Why?”</p><p>“Did she ever try to stop you?”</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>“I’m not following you.”</p><p>“It’s blood money, Sam. There’s only thirty coins like it in human history. It’s payment for services rendered.”</p><p>“What kind of services?”</p><p>Bobby’s voice grew into an even more urgent growl.</p><p>“The lore says there’s only way you earn that kind of silver. Same way Judas did. By betraying the people you love.”</p><p>“So should I get rid of it?”</p><p>“You’re not hearing me, Sam. It’s a done deal. Wouldn’t make a difference now if you did.”</p><p>“Bobby...”</p><p>“I’ll call you when I find out more,” Bobby said. “In the meantime, you better let Dean know what he’s up against.”</p><p>“I will,” Sam said. But when he looked back behind the rocks where his brother had been sitting, Dean was gone.</p><p>Sam made his way back down the hill. He found Dean squatting down behind the stands of cypress and live oak clustered along the creek, watching a Georgia State Police mobile crime lab that had pulled into the lot, finding its way between the clutter of other vehicles.</p><p>“What happened to you?” Sam asked, crouching down beside him.</p><p>“Just came down for a closer look.” Dean glanced back at him, his expression unreadable. “What’d Bobby have to say?”</p><p>“The coin’s two thousand years old.” As he said these words, Sam realized he’d started to reach up and touch his collar, where his FBI agent’s tie still hung loose around his neck. He consciously lowered his hand. “It confirms the Judas hypothesis that Cass was talking about.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>Sam let out a long sigh. “No. No, it isn’t.”</p><p>Dean looked back at his brother and narrowed his eyes.</p><p>“What going on, Sammy?”</p><p>“This is blood money.” Sam reached into his pocket and pulled out the shekel. “Bobby says the only way anybody gets their hands on this...” The rest of the sentence was getting stuck somewhere in his chest, and he made himself finish it, “is by betraying someone you love.”</p><p>Dean stared at him.</p><p>“I haven’t done anything, Dean!”</p><p>“So maybe it’s a down payment.”</p><p>“What do you want me to say? You think I’m happy about this?”</p><p>“I think you’re in over your head.”</p><p>“So what, you want me to sit this one out? Handcuff myself to a tree till it’s over?”</p><p>Dean turned away and shook his head, looking more exasperated than anything else.</p><p>“Is this part of that nightmare you had?”</p><p>“It might be,” Sam said. “I still don’t remember most of it.” He stared down at the silver piece, then closed his fist around it and threw it as hard as he could into the creek, where it sparkled once and disappeared into the brown, slow-moving water.</p><p>For a silent moment they just sat there behind the trees, looking across the battleground and the parking lot, neither knowing what to say. The police forensics van reached the proximal end of the parking lot and was angling for a place to park. There was a tow-truck behind it, and Sheriff Daniels was directing it backward between the patrol cars, pickups, and civilian vehicles still filling the lot.</p><p>Watching all of this, and observing his brother out of the corner of his eye, it seemed to Sam that Dean was just waiting for an opportunity to move forward again and put this conversation behind them. If he had any more that he needed to say, now was the time.</p><p>“Dean...”</p><p>“Look,” Dean broke in. “Don’t get too hung up on it, okay? It doesn’t necessarily mean anything.” He stood up and brushed off his jeans. “Whatever happens between us, we’ll deal with it then. Besides, you’ve still got a whole bag of those coins back in...” He stopped abruptly, galvanized by what he was staring at. “The car!”</p><p>“Dean, what—?”</p><p>“That bitch.” Dean pointed at the parking lot where the tow-truck was hoisting the Impala up on its winch. Seconds later he was fighting his way through the trees. “She’s towing my baby!”</p><p>“Dean, wait.” Sam caught up and grabbed his brother’s arm, holding him back. “Let’s stay focused.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m so focused,” Dean said, straining against the grip.</p><p>“If you go running out there now, we’ll both be in a holding cell in twenty minutes. You know that.” Sam took hold of Dean’s shoulders, holding his stare. “We’ll get her back, okay? I promise.”</p><p>“If there’s so much as one scratch on her fender, I swear—“</p><p>“Okay, okay, got it.” Sam nodded. “Now, you said you had a plan?”</p><p>Dean drew back and nodded across the river at the mobile crime unit. The technicians who climbed out of the back were garbed in heavy protective gear—suits, respirators and isolation masks that draped over their heads and shoulders like arc-welders’ hoods.</p><p>“Those guys,” he said. “That’s where we start.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The disorganized crowd of police, civilians and re-enactors in the parking lot was still thick enough that Sam and Dean were able to approach the mobile crime lab undetected.</p><p>The lab technicians were already moving through the battlefield, and the state troopers and local police were busy evacuating the re-enactors and civilians. In all of the activity, nobody appeared to notice as Sam and Dean climbed into the back of the lab vehicle and procured two extra isolation suits and masks.</p><p>Sam grabbed two laminated ID badges by the lanyard and tossed one to Dean.</p><p>Dean looked at the name.</p><p>“How do you pronounce this—Cerasi?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. They can’t see our faces through here.”</p><p>Lowering the biohazard hoods and eye-shields down over their eyes, Dean and Sam hopped down off the back of the truck. Dean looked behind, not entirely comfortable with the way the hood eclipsed his peripheral vision. He did a full three-sixty, still walking as he did so, and got a better view.</p><p>Along the western edge of the battlefield, a haphazard melange of media personalities, firemen, cops, and Civil War re-enactors were all clustered together watching the action. Surprisingly, and despite the overhead announcement by the state police, many of the soldiers didn’t appear to have left after all.</p><p>With a jolt he backed into someone.</p><p>“Hey,” a woman snapped, “watch where you’re going, pal.”</p><p>Dean looked up and saw that he’d walked right into the sheriff. The mask had hidden his face, and she hadn’t recognized him.</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>He and Sam kept walking until they reached the edge of the pit. Taking a deep breath through the air-purifier, Dean turned and looked down. More than one round must have struck the same spot, so the pit was deep.</p><p>It was a mass grave.</p><p>Forty feet below, ancient skeletons and bone-shards littered the inner walls of the pit everywhere they looked, along with chunks of shrapnel and rusty wartime ordnance. Here, a cannon barrel, there, a twisted mass that might have been a wagon. In the middle, a welter of ribs and spine segments and yellowish shafts that once had been a man. Dozens of men. Or more. The roots of trees were coiled among the last remains of the dead, knotting them in gnarled fists.</p><p>Squinting down into the hole, Dean Winchester’s first reaction was pure relief, a sweeping sense of, Oh. Is that all. Not that any self-actualized aspect of him had honestly expected to find some depthless hellhole, a channel into the underworld, puking up brimstone and capering demonic atrocities lunging forward... or whatever... and yet—</p><p>And yet he had.</p><p>He did.</p><p>Because that was what he did after spending years down there, doing what he’d done.</p><p>He wondered.</p><p>He worried.</p><p>He feared.</p><p>Through sheer force of will, Dean shoved those notions aside—all of them—as far and as hard as he possibly could. Now more than ever he didn’t want that experience contaminating the way he looked at the world... not that he had a choice.</p><p>Hell had been his Vietnam. It had stamped its mark on him for all eternity, and no amount of denial or self-imposed ignorance was going to change it.</p><p>Ever.</p><p>“Except this isn’t Hell,” he mumbled under his breath. “It’s just a bunch of dead soldiers.”</p><p>Suddenly that phrase, dead soldiers, struck him as improbably funny. He found himself imagining a pit littered with empty beer bottles, Pabst Blue Ribbon and Coors and perhaps the worst beer in America, Meister Brau. The tension cracked and he felt a welcome numbness spread over him in its place, stopping him where he stood.</p><p>A nearby police lab tech, mistaking his reaction for despair, gripped him by the shoulder.</p><p>“Steady on, man. First time’s tough on all of us.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean managed, more grateful than ever that the mask hid his face. “It’s tough all right.”</p><p>“We’re just here to do a job, right?”</p><p>“You got it, buddy.”</p><p>“Hey, Dean.” It was Sam, tapping him on the other shoulder. “Are you seeing this?”</p><p>“What part?”</p><p>“Over there.”</p><p>Dean looked. The impromptu investigation team was lowering a sling and pulley contraption over the edge. Down below one of the workers was attaching it to an oblong box sticking halfway out of the dirt at the bottom of the crater. The box appeared to be made of iron. Unlike the other relics and debris in the pit, the passing century and a half didn’t seem to have affected it much at all.</p><p>If anything, the metal appeared to be even shinier—more luminous—than it had any right to be. Seeing the thing gleaming, Dean imagined what it must have been like, buried under tons of dirt for decade after decade, shining all by itself deep in the ground with a stark unwholesome intensity that radiated from within its depths.</p><p>As the winch hauled the thing upward out of the hole, dragging it by a handle at one end, more of it came into sight. He began to notice a series of inscriptions glinting along its edges. The coffin rotated slowly, catching the light, then settled into place as the makeshift crane set it down on the opposite side of the crater.</p><p>“Come on,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean jogged behind him around the crater’s outer rim. Several members of the Sheriff Daniels’ investigation team had already gathered around the casket and were looking at it curiously. More were on their way over, along with one of the TV camera crews and a detachment of re-enactors who seemed to have become bolder about ‘contaminating the crime scene.’</p><p>Hunching down in the middle of the group where he wouldn’t be so conspicuous, Dean slipped his isolation hood off, letting the breeze cool the layer of sweat that had formed over his forehead and upper lip. He took in a deep breath and let it out. Either he’d actually started getting used to the smell of the pit, or it had begun to dissipate.</p><p>“Can you read any of this, Sam?” he asked.</p><p>Glancing around nervously, Sam took off his own mask for a better look and reached down to brush a remaining clod of dirt from the lid. The thing’s surface shone out brightly, almost winking at them.</p><p>“It’s familiar,” he started. “These markings—“ He stopped. “I think they match the symbols in Beauchamp’s journal.”</p><p>“This is Beauchamp’s coffin, then.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Before Sam could get a closer look, the group of workers that had brought out the coffin lifted it up and began carrying it back toward the waiting forensics vehicle. Following it into the open parking lot, Sam realized, would only leave him more exposed to the possibility of being recognized.</p><p>And then it was too late.</p><p>“Sam!”</p><p>He glanced up and saw what Dean had already noticed. On the other side of the pit, perhaps forty feet away, Sheriff Daniels was staring straight at him with a resolute expression that somehow combined recognition, determination, and anger. He supposed he’d known this would happen when he took off the hood... but some part of him hadn’t expected that it would happen so fast.</p><p>“We’re made,” he said.</p><p>“Hang tight.” Dean was backing up, glancing right and left. More than anything he resembled a quarterback taking stock of his options, even the utterly crazy ones. But they were out of time.</p><p>Daniels and her deputies were already moving toward them. There was no way out.</p><p>Damn it, Sam thought, we’re gonna spend the night in jail. Maybe more. And we don’t have that kind of time.</p><p>Suddenly Dean saw something that seemed to change the game for him. With a shout, he flung one hand up in the air.</p><p>“Yo, Commanches!”</p><p>Sam turned around and saw several state troopers escorting a group of re-enactors that he identified as members of Dave Wolverton’s division—the Fighting 32^nd^—past the still-panicked horses of the Confederate armed cavalry division. The soldier up in front was particularly familiar, and it took Sam less than five seconds to recognize Sarah Rafferty.</p><p>From where he stood, it looked like she was trying to get the horses out.</p><p>She looked up as Sheriff Daniels approached the Winchesters.</p><p>“Private Will Tanner!” Dean shouted. “Little help here?”</p><p>For an instant, Sarah didn’t seem to understand what was being asked of her. Then she did.</p><p>The entire equation—the look on the sheriff’s face, directed at Sam and Dean—unfolded in her expression, and she reached forward and grabbed the bolt on the horse paddock, opening the gate.</p><p>All the horses came spilling out in a great galloping wave. It was as if all the pent-up fear from the explosions had finally been given free rein. The animals cut across the open battleground in front of Sam and Dean, hooves thundering hard across the earth between the cops and emergency workers, forcing everyone backward with the atavistic dread that sends people scurrying out of the path of stampeding animals.</p><p>“Now!” Sam felt Dean’s hand on his wrist. “Go!”</p><p>Using the stampede as cover, they yanked their masks back down and ran along behind the group of lab technicians carrying the casket toward the mobile crime lab. They helped load it into the back of the vehicle, then quickly climbed up after it. When they looked back down, the rest of the police forensics team—four of them, plus the driver—were climbing up into the back of the vehicle with them.</p><p>“Stay here,” Dean said. “Me and my partner will handle this one.”</p><p>“By yourselves?” The man in front took off his mask, his eyes flicking down to the badge around Dean’s neck. “On whose orders?”</p><p>Before Dean could answer, there was a crash and a shout somewhere behind them. The horses were in the parking lot now, running between the cars and creating even more confusion.</p><p>The man in front whipped around to see what had happened.</p><p>“Let’s move,” Dean bellowed. He pulled the door shut and shouted back up to driver. “Where are we headed?”</p><p>“This is Federal jurisdiction now,” the man behind the wheel called back. “We’ve got a plane waiting at Malcolm County Airport. Are you the only two riding along?”</p><p>“Looks that way,” Sam said.</p><p>“Where’s everybody else?”</p><p>Dean glanced out of the back window, where various members of state and local law enforcement had joined with the re-enactors in responding to the stampede.</p><p>“Rounding up horses. Looks like they stuck us with thegg stiff.” He shrugged. “What are you gonna do?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The mobile crime scene truck rolled away from the battlefield and out of the parking lot, trundling down the country highway away from the town. It was bumpier than the road that led into town, and through the windows Sam saw the country landscape whipping past in a steady stream of green hills and blue sky.</p><p>“If those demons were taking the time to tear the whole field apart with cannon fire,” Sam said, “they must have been pretty convinced that the noose was in Beauchamp’s casket.”</p><p>“So let’s take a look.”</p><p>Sam eyed the coffin.</p><p>“Now?” he said doubtfully. “You sure?”</p><p>“No problem. Find me a screwdriver.”</p><p>“No, I mean, you really want to open this up?”</p><p>“That’s why we’re here, isn’t it?”</p><p>“We don’t even know what’s going to happen.”</p><p>Dean let out a breath.</p><p>“The coffin’s pretty obviously not stopping the noose’s power. So we need to get it out and destroy it.”</p><p>“Just let me try Bobby first.” Sam dug out his cell phone and dialed, waiting while it rang and finally went to voicemail. “He’s not answering.”</p><p>“That’s it, then.” Dean looked around. The back of the morgue vehicle was lined with steel cabinets and swing-bins of carefully stored instruments, chemical compounds, and medical tools. “Here.” He picked up a shovel, and crouching beside the coffin wedged it underneath the lid. “This’ll do.”</p><p>The driver angled the rearview mirror, glowering back at them.</p><p>“Hey!” he shouted. “You know we aren’t supposed to tamper with evidence.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Dean said. “We’ve got prior authorization.”</p><p>“From who?”</p><p>“Uh, Colonel... Sanders.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Sam shot his brother a glaring WTF stare. Dean just shrugged and twisted the shovel handle as hard as he could. Something inside the casket cracked wide open, and the hinges let out a low, creaking sound as the lid scraped upward.</p><p>“You guys aren’t doing anything to that coffin, are you?”</p><p>Ignoring him, Dean levered the shovel down harder. Sam squatted next to him, hooking his fingers under the lid, flinching and catching his breath as he pried it upward.</p><p>“Whoa,” Dean recoiled. “More stinky smell? Really?”</p><p>Sam shrugged and covered his nose. The back tires of the truck bumped upward, seeming to agitate the smell even more. It wasn’t quite as rancid as the reek from the mass grave—but it was more intense, more preserved somehow, and spicy, like canned jerky that had been sequestered away somewhere for a century and a half.</p><p>Peering down, Sam looked into the casket’s interior. It contained bones, most of them shifted to one side, where they looked smaller and somehow random. One of the ribs was tangled in what looked like an old suspender, complete with a metal buckle. There was a rusty old revolver that had long ago started reverting into its component parts.</p><p>“Oh, man. What happened?” Dean poked through the rest of their stained and brittle remains, looking like a kid whose Christmas toy had arrived broken before he’d gotten a chance to play with it. He picked up the toppled-loose skull and set it aside.</p><p>Shards of human pottery and a pair of broken-down hobnailed boots were all that remained of Jubal Beauchamp. There were tattered gray rags of his uniform and a few brass buttons rattling around the bottom like loose teeth, and that was all.</p><p>“Talk about no prize in the Crackerjacks,” Dean said. “Where’s the noose?”</p><p>“It’s not here.”</p><p>“Hey!” the driver was looking back at them. “Hey!”</p><p>“Well, where is it then?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Dean.”</p><p>“Why don’t we ask Johnny Reb here.” Dean picked up Beauchamp’s skull again and turned it around to face him, Hamlet-style. “Hey, Jubal. Where’s the noose, huh, buddy?” He turned to Sam. “What do you know, he ain’t talking either.”</p><p>“Dean—“</p><p>But Dean wasn’t looking at him anymore. He was staring directly at the skull, still in his hand, at the thin dark tendrils of smoky-colored substance that had begun to drift out of its empty sockets.</p><p>“Uh, Dean...?”</p><p>The black substance began to float upward, still sluggish, as if awakened from a long sleep. There was something swirling in its depths, Sam realized, something alive and hideously aware.</p><p>Moa’ah.</p><p>The stuff floating in front of him swirled around Sam’s head with slow, exploratory curiosity, forming a ring that, under the circumstances, reminded him of a noose. It reminded him of the way squid-ink moved through water... except that it was drifting through the air, hanging suspended in the back of the truck.</p><p>For a second it appeared to hook around in the shape of a question mark. Then it tightened.</p><p>Sam’s head began to throb, as if they’d just gone through an abrupt change in barometric pressure. He felt dizzy, sick to his stomach, like a man who’s just realized he’s coming down with a particularly nasty strain of the flu.</p><p>“Don’t look at it,” Dean said.</p><p>“Don’t...?” Sam arched an eyebrow. “Is this a Raiders of the Lost Ark thing?”</p><p>“Damn it, Sam—“</p><p>“Okay, all right, I’m not looking.”</p><p>“And no sudden moves,” Dean said. “I think it’s still waking up. It’s been locked in the dark for a long time.” His eyes darted, following the motion of the thing in the air. “But pretty soon it’s going to realize it’s been messed with and get pissed.</p><p>“I’m going to put the skull down,” he added.</p><p>“Good idea.”</p><p>As gently as possible, he set it back into the coffin. The Moa’ah that had emerged from the eye-sockets began slithering back down, pouring itself inside. It was as if, given the choice of attacking a stranger or staying with the human remains that had been its companion for the last hundred and sixty years, it had chosen the familiar option.</p><p>At least for now.</p><p>“What in God’s name...?” the driver bawled from up in front. He turned around to peer angrily into the back. “The whole truck stinks to high heaven!”</p><p>“Sorry.” Dean’s voice was a shaky attempt at normalcy. “Army beans for breakfast.”</p><p>“You can’t—“</p><p>“Look out!” Sam shouted.</p><p>The driver looked back around, but it was too late. The station wagon that was parked up ahead of them, directly across the double-yellow line, was less than twenty feet away when he hit the brakes. The forensics van was still going sixty miles an hour when it slammed into it broadside, T-boning it with the full impact of its one and a half tons of steel.</p><p>For an instant the whole world went red. Then, one by one, Sam’s senses began returning.</p><p>He heard glass shattering, and he and Dean were pitched forward with the force of impact, bouncing off the metal cabinets and canisters of supplies.</p><p>A jar of foul-smelling fluid burst open underneath him, filling the air with the acrid spirits of formaldehyde. The coffin full of bones flew forward too, a prisoner of its own velocity. Thrown by the momentum, the open iron box shot straight ahead as if fired by some invisible slingshot, smashing straight up into the driver’s seat, and there was a third burst of glass as the van’s windshield gave way.</p><p>Up in the cab, the driver started to scream. Vaguely, like images glimpsed through a foggy windowpane, Sam saw the black substance enveloping the man’s head. It did something to his face. He thrashed violently in his seatbelt, arms hooking the air, fighting to get loose.</p><p>Then the screaming stopped.</p><p>In the silence that followed, Sam became aware of a squelching, sucking sound coming from the front of the van, from where the driver was sitting. The Moa’ah was still up there, he realized, still wrapped around the driver’s face. Absurdly, his mind gibbered with an immortal line from ‘A Visit from Saint Nicholas.’</p><p>It encircled his head like a wreath.</p><p>There was a tinkling of broken glass and spilled tools behind him as Dean lifted himself up from the floor of the van with a groan.</p><p>“Sammy? You all right?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Except he wasn’t. His shoulder ached, and his right hip felt as if someone had gone to work on it with a sledgehammer. Nevertheless, he picked himself up out of the rubble. “I’m going to go up and check on the driver.”</p><p>Limping a little, he ducked down and crept his way forward toward the front seat. For a moment his attention was completely arrested by the view through the smashed-in windshield. The van had knocked the station wagon completely off the highway, throwing it sideways into a ditch on the far right side of the road where it lay, half-accordioned, the hood hissing steam. The entire wood-paneled side had been punched in, but Sam could see that it was empty. Whoever had parked it lengthwise across the double yellow line had simply abandoned it there.</p><p>He shifted his attention. Directly in front of the van, not far from the grille, Beauchamp’s coffin lay in the middle of the road where the impact of the collision had flung it. The coffin had landed sideways and Sam saw Beauchamp’s bones strewn out across the asphalt. Only a cluster of them remained in the coffin.</p><p>He couldn’t see the skull, but it had to be out there somewhere. The other bones looked like pieces from some extravagantly complex dice game whose results determined the cosmic fate of all parties involved.</p><p>Finally, he glanced sideways at the driver’s seat. He could see the back of the driver’s head, angled slightly to the left as if the man were checking his side-view mirror.</p><p>“Hey, buddy.” He didn’t really expect an answer.</p><p>Taking one last step forward—so that he was in line with the driver and passenger seats—Sam tapped the man’s shoulder, then shook it. The head lolled around to reveal a gaping red hole where his face should have been. The driver’s eyes, nose and mouth had been scooped out, all the way back to the occipital region of his skull. The front of his shirt was a bib of gore, gray brain matter and windshield glass.</p><p>Sam’s mind flashed to the man’s screams, and the sucking sounds that followed.</p><p>The Moa’ah did this to him. But why ?</p><p>Then he saw it.</p><p>Beauchamp’s skull had fallen out of the coffin during its brief, violent trip forward.</p><p>And it had landed on the driver’s lap.</p><p>He looked closer. Hovering just inside the eye sockets, on the brink of visibility, was the pulsating black substance.</p><p>It might not have been fully awake before, Sam thought, but it’s awake now. And Dean was right: it is pissed.</p><p>“Sam?” Dean’s voice called from the back. “How bad is it up there?”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He scarcely breathed.</p><p>Gingerly, like a man picking up a nest of swarming hornets, he made himself lift Beauchamp’s skull, gripping it from the back. He could feel the Moa’ah humming around inside, filling its hollow bony hemisphere, like a cell phone set on vibrate. He held the skull briefly in his fingertips, then turned and hurled it as hard as fast as he could through the hole in the blown-out windshield out onto the road in front of them. It clattered once and rolled across the pavement, coming to rest next to a black boot.</p><p>“Thank you, Sam. How considerate of you to do our work for us.”</p><p>Sam looked up at the source of the sardonic voice.</p><p>Perhaps twenty yards ahead, a group of five re-enactors in Union and Confederate uniforms and hats were standing shoulder to shoulder in the middle of the road. They smiled, and their eyes flicked jet-black.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam felt a surge of exhaustion, “demons.”</p><p>“I’ll alert the media,” Dean muttered.</p><p>“Sam and Dean Winchester,” the Confederate soldier next to the skull said, “again we prove that there’s nothing you can possess we cannot take away.”</p><p>Dean groaned.</p><p>“Is he quoting Raiders?”</p><p>“It seemed appropriate,” the demon said. “Nice hazmat suits, by the way. Got tired of the FBI outfits, did you?”</p><p>Without waiting for a response, the demon bent down and picked up Beauchamp’s skull, holding it at arm’s length to better investigate the Moa’ah pulsating inside it.</p><p>“Where’s the noose, boys?” he asked.</p><p>“It’s not there,” Dean said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You heard me, ugly.” Dean had squeezed past Sam now and into the passenger seat, opening the door and climbing out. “Looks like you fellas got hold of some false intel.”</p><p>“Don’t bother lying to us.”</p><p>“We’re not,” Sam said. “The noose wasn’t in the coffin. See for yourself.”</p><p>Still holding Beauchamp’s skull in one hand, the soldier demon moved forward toward the casket, the others following behind. Two of them squatted down, searching through the bones and debris.</p><p>“He’s right,” one of them confirmed. “It’s not here.”</p><p>“Looks like you just bit the bag and stepped out the door, sunshine,” Dean said. “Don’t say we didn’t—“</p><p>The Confederate soldier roared a snarl of furious rage. Then he threw the skull down as hard as he could. It cracked, but didn’t shatter.</p><p>“I wouldn’t do that,” Sam said, climbing out next to his brother.</p><p>Ignoring him, the demon brought a boot down on the skull—hard.</p><p>Two things happened at once.</p><p>The skull broke open under his heel with a brisk ceramic crack, and the Moa’ah—in its full awakened and angry state—came spurting up and outward, rounding in midair and plunging back toward the demon with a violent spearlike thrust.</p><p>Sam had never heard a demon scream quite like it. The Moa’ah eviscerated its meat-suit in less than a second, ripping directly through the Confederate soldier’s chest cavity and almost splitting it in two.</p><p>The demon shrieked and flashed out, but before its parts even hit the asphalt, the Moa’ah had changed course again, arcing back on the other demons gathered around Beauchamp’s bones. It tore through demons two and three with a speed and fury that was almost too fast to see, and flashed around to wipe out the last two with a single slashing downward stroke.</p><p>Then it swirled back around, settling among dissolute bones in the coffin that had been its home for the past century and a half. The lid swung shut with a clank.</p><p>“Whoa,” Dean said. “Should we run now?”</p><p>“Yeah. Running’s good.”</p><p>“So,” Dean said. “How far do you think it is back to town?”</p><p>“Couple miles.”</p><p>“Great.”</p><p>Sam glanced at him.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“‘Cuz, you know,” Dean patted his flat stomach, “I could really use the exercise.”</p><p>They both spun around and broke into a sprint.</p><p>They hadn’t gone twenty feet when they saw the police lights careening straight up the road at them from the direction of town, coming too fast to dodge.</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The cruiser’s tires scraped to a halt in front of them and Sheriff Daniels sprang out of the car, handcuffs already in hand. The ferocity of her expression alone would have smelted steel.</p><p>“You two have no idea how much trouble you’re in,” she said. “You’re both—“</p><p>“Under arrest,” Dean finished. “Yeah, we get it.”</p><p>“Up against the car.” Jamming Sam forward, Daniels jerked his hands back and clapped the metal bracelets on his wrists, frisking him thoroughly. “Spread your legs.”</p><p>“Hey,” Dean said, “don’t forget me.”</p><p>Daniels stuffed Sam into the back seat of the cruiser. From the passenger seat, her big swag-bellied deputy—Jerry was the name that Dean fished out of his memory—stepped out, ready with the sap should things turn ugly. At first Dean thought the guy was going to be the one to frisk him, proving yet again that his bad luck was coming in streaks. But then the deputy saw the wreckage of the truck in the road ahead and kept walking.</p><p>“Hey, sheriff,” he shouted back. “You’re gonna want to check this out.”</p><p>“Hold on.” Daniels quickly cuffed Dean, and he felt her hands go over his body, patting him down roughly.</p><p>“Whoa,” Dean said. “Try a little tenderness, huh?”</p><p>“What’s this?” She yanked out Ruby’s demon-killing knife and examined it.</p><p>“I’m going to need that back.”</p><p>“I don’t think so.” She opened the back of the cruiser and shoved him in next to Sam, slamming the door behind them. It was cramped and smelled like some generic bleach-based disinfectant. With his hands cuffed behind him, Dean had to lean forward, bent over his knees. There were two door handles on the inside back doors, and the wire mesh separating them from the front was caged steel.</p><p>“Well, this sucks,” he observed.</p><p>Sam nodded and watched Sheriff Daniels walking up the road to join the deputy. Suddenly he heard Jerry’s voice.</p><p>“Holy crap!”</p><p>“Sounds like they found the meat-suits,” Dean said.</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“They’ll pin it all on us, y’know.”</p><p>“No doubt.”</p><p>They watched as Sheriff Daniels spun and headed back toward the cruiser, walking fast, almost running. She slid into the front seat and picked up her radio, keying the mic.</p><p>“This is Sheriff Daniels requesting immediate backup at a single-vehicle MVA on Highway 17, mile-marker 83. Multiple confirmed casualties, red-blanket, notify emergency services.”</p><p>The radio crackled and an ambulance dispatcher confirmed the request, echoing it back.</p><p>“I hope you two have good lawyers,” Daniels said, glaring at them in the rearview mirror. “You’re going to need them.”</p><p>“We have some people we can call,” Dean said.</p><p>The sheriff didn’t reply. As she turned the microphone around and put it back, her sleeve rose up slightly, and Dean noticed something he’d never seen before—a small symbolic tattoo spread over her right wrist. It was a ring of numbers, surrounded by a tiny ring of stars. Inside the smaller circle, two overlapping pentagrams formed an oddly asymmetrical design, like a kind of web.</p><p>He snapped a glance at Sam, who nodded back at him. He’d seen it, too.</p><p>“Nice ink,” Dean said.</p><p>Daniels stiffened. Without looking back, she tugged the shirt-cuff down again over the design, covering it up.</p><p>“I’m taking you back to the station,” she said. “My deputy’s waiting here for backup.”</p><p>“That’s a Santeria charm, isn’t it?” Sam asked.</p><p>The sheriff started the engine and swung the car around. She gunned it, the cruiser’s big V-8 roaring as the landscape around them became an afterthought.</p><p>“How much do you really know about that noose?” Sam asked. “What are you using it for?”</p><p>Daniels’ face flashed from the rearview mirror.</p><p>“If I were you, I’d keep quiet until I had counsel present.”</p><p>“You’ve got bigger problems than us, lady,” Dean said. “You saw the driver. You think we did that to him?” He shook his head. “There’s stuff walking around in those woods out there that you don’t even have names for.”</p><p>The sheriff glanced back.</p><p>“You’d be surprised—“ she began, and in front of them, fifty yards ahead, something burst out of the woods and went streaking into the road. At first, out of sheer surprise, Dean thought it was an animal, maybe a deer. Then he realized it was a man standing on the broken yellow line staring back at them with a kind of distant intensity that Dean associated with just one individual in his life.</p><p>“Look out!” he shouted.</p><p>Up ahead, Castiel didn’t budge. Daniels jerked her head forward, saw him standing there and slammed on the brakes. The cruiser slung around sideways, skidding and fishtailing across both lanes and over the shoulder, rolling onto its side and down into the gully.</p><p>Second crash of the day, Dean thought through the haze. Good deal.</p><p>In the front seat, Daniels was bent over sideways, still conscious, struggling to get out of her seatbelt.</p><p>Outside, Castiel sprang past the driver’s side door and jerked open the back, grabbing Dean and hauling him out, then reaching in for Sam.</p><p>The sheriff squirmed around.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?”</p><p>“Run.” Castiel looked winded, as if what he’d just done had taxed him to the limit. “Go.”</p><p>Sam and Dean scrambled over the shoulder and down the embankment, crashing into the woods with their hands still cuffed behind them. The sun blazed down, flashing through the leaves. Every direction looked the same. They ran deeper into the woods, already lost and disoriented, until Dean realized there was no chance of finding their way back out again.</p><p>They kept going, moving forward for half an hour. Incredibly, the foliage around them grew thicker still. Branches clutched and grabbed at their clothing, as if the landscape itself had turned against them. Neither of them spoke.</p><p>The uneven terrain was marred by fallen branches, tangled brambles, and holes in the ground, and Sam knew that if he or Dean stepped into one and twisted an ankle, they’d be done for. There was no way one of them could carry the other with their hands cuffed behind them.</p><p>What happens if it’s you, Sam? a voice asked. It was the voice from his dream. Would you leave your brother behind?</p><p>No, of course not, Sam replied silently.</p><p>Oh really? Thirty silver pieces say otherwise.</p><p>Sam pushed the thought out of his head. It wasn’t difficult. He forced himself to concentrate on moving forward, forward, forward.</p><p>Then they hit the swamp.</p><p>“Stop,” Dean gasped. “You hear that?”</p><p>Sam shook his head. They’d been running hard and the only thing he could hear was his own heart pounding and his breath tea-kettling in and out of his lungs. His chest was on fire, the flames shooting up his throat into his head.</p><p>“Listen.”</p><p>“Dean...”</p><p>“Shh!”</p><p>Sam staggered around sideways, sweat dripping from his face. They were standing in a thicket of vines and root systems, amid swarms of buzzing mosquitoes that hovered over his face in clouds, filling his ears with their constant whine. His damp wrists squirmed in the cuffs, his hands begging illogically to wave the bugs away. Mossy fungus smells rose up from the ground. His legs were soaked to the knees with thick black muck that seemed to suck and clutch at the fabric of his pants with every laborious step.</p><p>He waited, listening.</p><p>And then he heard it.</p><p>Barking. Yelping.</p><p>Baying.</p><p>“Are those bloodhounds?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer. He was facing in the opposite direction. When Sam finally caught a look at his brother’s face, he saw that Dean’s cheeks and forehead had gone absolutely white, as if every drop of blood had been sucked away, leaving his complexion frightened and hollow. The result made his eyes burn so feverishly green that they were almost incandescent.</p><p>“Dean—“</p><p>“We gotta run.” Dean was trembling so hard that his voice was shaking. His eyes were twitching everywhere at once. “We gotta outrun them, Sammy.”</p><p>“They’re not hellhounds, Dean. They’re just dogs.”</p><p>“They’re on our trail!”</p><p>“Okay, look,” Sam stalked a few steps forward, felt the muck growing steadily softer under his boots, “it’s swampy through here. Which means we’re near a creek. If we can get through it, they’ll lose our scent. Right?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer. He was still listening to the barking and howling noises coming closer, crashing through the undergrowth. He seemed paralyzed by the sounds.</p><p>No more time. If we’re going to do something, do it now.</p><p>Sam threw his shoulder against his brother and knocked him forward, forcing Dean to go stomping along next to him. The smell of the swamp filled his nose, a rich, fungal scent of dead logs and stagnant water, coming from straight ahead of them. Deep puddles splashed around them, reeds and cattails rustling up ahead in strange whispering sighs. Frogs croaked. He felt the water, sun-warmed at the surface but cold and viscous below, surging up to his knees, and then, abruptly, his waist.</p><p>After a momentary pause, Sam just grunted and kept going, glancing over at his brother from time to time. But Dean was moving on his own now.</p><p>It was getting more difficult to drag his boots up from the bottom. The hounds sounded very close, near enough that if he turned around, he thought he might actually see the foliage moving behind them. Exhaustion had taken hold of his muscles and wrung them out.</p><p>They made their way through lily pads and pond scum, heads tilted back as the water went up to their necks.</p><p>“Sam?” Dean’s whisper sounded uneven and high. “Not getting any shallower here.”</p><p>Sam nodded and took another step. Suddenly the muddy bottom was gone and he went under. His feet hit something on the bottom, and he pushed upward. Shooting back to the surface with a gasp, spluttering and spitting out dirty water, he felt something slide past his calf. A water moccasin curved its way across the surface and slashed into the high grass.</p><p>He let out a sharp breath, a switchblade of panic flipping open in his stomach. He lunged forward, and found purchase for his feet again, thrashing along blindly with no regard for speed, direction or the noise he was making, unaware even of how much time had passed until Dean hissed his name from somewhere behind him.</p><p>“Wait,” Dean said. “Don’t move.”</p><p>Sam fell still. The veil of flying insect bites tightened around his scalp and neck. Every inch of his skin seemed to crawl. He was aware of his own breath rippling over the water in front of his face.</p><p>“They’re going the other way.”</p><p>It was true—the howling, hooting noises of the dogs were dopplering away from them now, receding into the distance, deeper into the woods.</p><p>“Lost ‘em,” Dean breathed, then he sniffed the air, his voice different now. “Wait a minute. Do you smell smoke?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sam looked and caught a glimpse of orange flame flickering through the trees. “It’s coming from over there.”</p><p>Moving cautiously, they pulled themselves out of the water. Then they made their way into a small clearing.</p><p>A campfire burned unattended.</p><p>Two Civil War tents, neither of them any more sophisticated than the makeshift canvas-and-rope contraptions they’d seen back on the battlefield, leaned against a copse of scrub oak on the far edge of the swamp. In the fire-pit, the flames were burning down, and the last embers smoldered, keeping the bugs at bay. Scraps of wool uniforms, abandoned breeches, knapsacks and boots, all lay scattered on the periphery, where their wearers seemed to have cast them off without regard to where they’d fallen.</p><p>Some of them appeared to have been ripped off.</p><p>“Dean?”</p><p>Dean sniffed.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s sulfur.”</p><p>“Okay, demons.” Sam poked the fire with his toe. There were cans of lighter fluid next to it. “Meaning what?”</p><p>“We shouldn’t stay and roast marshmallows?”</p><p>“We should check the tents.”</p><p>Dean gave him a look.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Maybe there’re some tools we can use to get these cuffs off.”</p><p>“Yeah. Meanwhile, if there’s anything bigger than a bumblebee in there, it’s going to kick our ass.”</p><p>“There’s nobody here.”</p><p>Dean walked over and kicked open the flap in front of him, leaning down.</p><p>“You’re right,” he said. “Just a few candy wrappers. Man, these demons are total slobs. Yours?”</p><p>Sam squatted down and looked into his tent. At first he thought the lump in the shadows was just a dirty bedroll with more torn clothing strewn over it. Then he heard the flies droning around it with their meaningless little fly noises. Sliding one foot in, he kicked off the stained Confederate flag draped over the pile.</p><p>It wasn’t a bedroll.</p><p>The bloated corpse of the man under the flag seemed to grin up at him. He was stripped to the waist with his arms and legs tied down with ropes and staked directly into the ground. Hooks pierced his lips, cheeks and eyelids, and wires pulled them back. The flesh of his chest and belly had been peeled away, layer by layer, exposing red muscle and tissue beneath it, a life-sized anatomy lesson.</p><p>In the center of his chest, a larger iron hook on a heavier chain plunged through the open rib cage, impaling his heart.</p><p>“Holy crap,” Dean said, peering over Sam’s shoulder. “It’s Winston.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“The coroner, Todd Winston. The sheriff’s brother-in-law.”</p><p>“They tortured him.”</p><p>“Demons don’t normally do this. They torture souls in Hell, but...” Dean shook his head, stepping into the tent. “They must have really wanted to get some information from him, and badly.”</p><p>He leaned forward, toeing a rag-wrapped bundle next to Winston’s head, and Sam heard metal instruments clinking together.</p><p>“Sounds like some medieval stuff in here.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer. He was gazing down at what he’d uncovered. The tool at his feet looked like an oversized pair of pliers combined with the blades of a bone saw, their serrated edges caked with untold decades of dried blood, clots of hair and human grease.</p><p>“You know how to use those?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said evenly. “I do.”</p><p>Backing up next to Winston’s staked-out corpse, he sank down to his knees, clutching the tool behind his back. For a moment he maneuvered his shoulders and elbows around and then Sam heard the chain break open with a sharp, brittle clank.</p><p>Dean’s hands appeared in front of him again, a steel bracelet on each wrist.</p><p>“Got it,” he said. “Now you.”</p><p>He lifted the sharpened pliers again and snapped the chain on Sam’s cuffs.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it.”</p><p>Dean emerged from the tent and looked down at the campfire. He bent down and picked up a can of lighter fluid in both hands, then started spraying it over the ground as he moved back toward the tent.</p><p>“Stand back.”</p><p>“Hang on. I’m going to take another look at Winston’s corpse first.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“I think I saw something on his wrist.” Drawing aside the flap, Sam ducked back into the tent and bent down beside the corpse, inspecting its arm.</p><p>“Hey, Dean?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Check this out.” Sam pointed to Winston’s left wrist. The skin was blistered and scorched black, as if someone had endeavored to burn it off, but he could still make out the tattoo imprinted there. “That’s another Santeria sigil, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Like the one Sheriff Daniels had, yeah,” Dean said. “What’s it mean?”</p><p>“Demons wanted it off.”</p><p>“Or somebody did.” Dean held up the lighter fluid. “We finished here?”</p><p>Sam nodded, and Dean tossed him a can of his own. They sprayed the tent along with the demons’ clothes and supplies, and when they were finished, Dean picked up a glowing log from the fire and tossed it.</p><p>“Good riddance,” he muttered as they turned and walked away.</p><p>They picked a direction and started walking, slashing their way back through the brush and undergrowth. It was easier going with their hands free—or at least easier to wave away the mosquitoes—but Sam still had no real sense of direction. The demon camp had sent his inner compass-needle spinning recklessly out of control, as if they’d stumbled across some disorienting magnetic field.</p><p>“It’s getting marshy again,” Dean said, cutting through another puddle of water. “We’re not walking in circles, are we?”</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Great.” With a groan, Dean reached into his back pocket and pulled out his cell phone, poking listlessly at the buttons. “Thing’s ruined. I knew it would be. You got yours?”</p><p>“Nope. It’s a dud, too.”</p><p>Dean frowned.</p><p>“Wait a second, what the hell’s that?”</p><p>Sam squinted across the clearing up ahead where the last vines and branches gave way to a parking lot.</p><p>“Is that...” Dean shielded his eyes, “...a Walmart?”</p><p>They waded up out of the water, past an upended shopping cart and stood there, dripping and filthy, in the late afternoon heat. For a moment neither of them spoke.</p><p>From where they stood, alongside the outer border of the swamp, the store gleamed in the distance, city-sized, planet-sized. Out here in the hinterlands of its parking lot, most of the spaces were empty except for a couple of RVs and eighteen-wheelers that looked as if they’d come to rest months ago. The closest one was a Winnebago the size of a city bus with a satellite dish and an airbrushed mural of wild horses running across a desert. It could have belonged to a pair of 401K-savvy retirees, or Kid Rock’s backup band.</p><p>“I guess we probably can’t just go up and ask for a ride,” Sam offered.</p><p>“No,” Dean said, then brightened. “But I bet there’s a pay phone in the store.”</p><p>Sam looked at his brother in the torn hazmat suit, tattered and covered with mud, and said nothing.</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It was nearing dusk when the black Ford Ranger swung up in front of the Walmart tire and automotive center and flashed its headlights.</p><p>Dean and Sam ran over and jumped into the cargo bed. Climbing in, Dean was vaguely reassured to see that the pickup was equipped with a fully supplied gun-rack. There was a modern pump-action shotgun resting on top, and below it, a perfectly tooled Civil War musket that looked just as lethal. Underneath that, behind the seat, was a canister of road salt.</p><p>“Rufus wouldn’t let me leave home without it,” Tommy McClane said, peering into the back and noticing Dean’s eyes on the weapon.</p><p>“Good for him.”</p><p>“I’d offer you a ride up front, but you two look like you’ve been mud-wrestling with a catfish.” He blinked in genuine amazement. “Are those hazmat suits?”</p><p>“Something like that,” Dean said.</p><p>“Should I even ask?”</p><p>“We’ll tell you everything when we get the chance. Right now I just want to get out of here.”</p><p>“Just lay low, stay under the tarp. Sheriff’s got roadblocks up, but it’s getting dark. I think I can get you through ‘em.”</p><p>Dean pulled the roll of canvas over them and felt the pickup pull forward and curve around the lot. Soon the country highway was humming along underneath them. Dean shut his eyes. He was exhausted and wanted a shower, a burger, and a beer.</p><p>Huddled next to him, Sam wasn’t saying anything, and that was fine with him. He had more than enough on his mind already.</p><p>Those pliers, for example, back at the camp.</p><p>He hadn’t seen those since Hell.</p><p>And in Hell, he’d used them every day.</p><p>Stop. You’re not up for this now.</p><p>He straightened up a little, and then tensed. The truck was slowing down, and then stopped. He heard voices and footsteps outside. A cop’s flashlight moved over the outside of the tarp.</p><p>“What do you have underneath there?” the cop’s voice asked.</p><p>“Table and chairs,” Tommy replied. He sounded slow and laconic, almost bored. “Promised my ex that I’d refinish ‘em for her. Amazing what a man’ll do for a six-pack and a little nostalgia sex, you know what I mean?” The truck door swung open as Tommy stepped down. “Here, I’ll show you.”</p><p>Come on, man, Dean thought, too tired even to worry about it. We aren’t the droids you’re looking for.</p><p>“Yeah, show a little consideration, and she gets all misty eyed,” Tommy continued. “Last time I did some chores for her, she just stripped down, right there in the living room, and—“</p><p>“Now hold on a second,” the cop said. He sounded upset.</p><p>“Yes, officer?”</p><p>“Do I look like someone who cares about your sex life? That’s entirely too much information. Why don’t you just haul your ass outta here, and stop wasting my time.”</p><p>“Suit yourself.” The pickup lurched a little again, the door slamming shut, the flashlight waving.</p><p>“Move along,” the cop said, “and drive safely.”</p><p>Back at the McClanes’ house, Sam and Dean found almost everything they wanted—hydrocortisone cream for Sam’s mosquito bites and, best of all, fresh hot cheeseburgers from Tommy’s kitchen stove.</p><p>They washed them down with cold beer while Nate brought a pair of bolt-cutters from the garage and cut the cuffs off, after which they spent twenty minutes rubbing the raw-red bruises encircling their wrists.</p><p>Sam finished eating and then used Tommy’s land-line to call Sarah Rafferty’s cell phone. She answered on the second ring, sounding glad to hear from them.</p><p>“After what happened out on the battlefield today,” she said, “I was worried about you both.”</p><p>“It would have been a lot worse if it weren’t for you,” Sam told her. “That was quick thinking.”</p><p>“I just remembered what you said about the sheriff. How she was more hindrance than help. But Sam...” Sarah’s voice hesitated a little, “are you really with the FBI?”</p><p>“No,” he said. “It’s something else.”</p><p>“What is it? Another government agency?”</p><p>“Not exactly. I don’t think it would make much sense if I tried to explain it.”</p><p>“You might be surprised,” she said. “But I won’t press you. Not if you’re really trying to figure out what happened with Dave.</p><p>“That is what you’re doing, isn’t it?” she added.</p><p>“Yes. That hasn’t changed.”</p><p>“Then I’m glad I helped you.” She sighed, and it was a shaky, restless sound. “At least I think so.”</p><p>“Where are you, Sarah?”</p><p>“I’m still out by the battleground. A lot of us are, actually—the re-enactors, I mean. The police have stopped trying to drive us off, for now anyway. They haven’t even had a chance to get those howitzers off the cliffside yet. We told them we’re not going anywhere until we get a reasonable explanation of what happened out there today, and so far, the authorities haven’t even acknowledged that anything out of the ordinary happened at all. It’s like Sheriff Daniels sneezed, and they all caught the misinformation flu.”</p><p>The misinformation flu. Sam found it an oddly apt turn of phrase. “Just be careful,” he said. “Take care of yourself. We’ll talk to you soon.”</p><p>“And you’ll explain more?”</p><p>“I’ll try,” he said. It was the closest he could come to the truth, and hoped for now it would be enough.</p><p>When Dean finished his beer, he pushed back his plate and stood up, turning to face Tommy.</p><p>“I don’t suppose there’s any way we could clean up a little.”</p><p>“I was wondering when we’d get around to that.” Tommy eyed the tattered hazmat suits that the Winchesters were still wearing. “I’d offer some of my gear, but you’re both taller than me and I don’t have clean clothes either one of you could fit into.”</p><p>“Our stuff is back at the motel,” Sam said. “At this point we can’t very well go back and get it ourselves.”</p><p>“Yeah, the cops’ll be watching it,” Tommy agreed. He glanced around, one eyebrow cocked. “There’s a general store in town where I could go pick up some clean clothes for you—jeans and t-shirts, at least. Y’all could just hang out here with Nate.”</p><p>“Much appreciated,” Sam said. He opened his wallet and handed Tommy some cash for the clothes. “I’ll even finish the dishes.”</p><p>“That’s a deal.”</p><p>Tommy paused as if to consider something.</p><p>“Oh, and Sam?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Don’t get me wrong, I’m on your side—you’re hunters, after all. But when I get back, and you are all showered and clean—“ He looked straight at Sam, his expression grim. “I’d appreciate an explanation of just what the hell is going on here.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, you’ll get it.”</p><p>Tommy turned and left, and Sam took his place at the sink and began washing the plates and cutlery. A moment later Nate came up alongside him and began wiping them dry before placing them carefully on the drying rack. The boy worked quickly, with easy efficiency. Glancing over at him, Sam noticed the automatic Whirlpool unit installed alongside the kitchen sink.</p><p>“You’ve got a dishwasher,” Sam said. “Don’t you use it?”</p><p>Nate shrugged.</p><p>“It’s just the two of us here. Dad says it’s not worth running.”</p><p>“Right.” Sam handed him another dish, and the boy dried it, front and back, with a couple deft swipes of the hand-towel.</p><p>Balanced on the shelf in front of them was a photo in a simple wooden frame, Tommy McClane and a pretty twenty-something redhead in a pale pink scoop-neck blouse and jade earrings, holding a toddler. The toddler—obviously a one year-old Nate—was wearing a giant, crooked grin and a t-shirt reading: I DO ALL MY OWN STUNTS.</p><p>“My brother and I grew up without a mom, too,” Sam said. He passed Nate another dish, and the boy took it without comment, rinsed and wiped and racked it. “It wasn’t always easy.” That was the last of the plates, and he turned the water off and wiped his hands on a towel. “Not everybody gets that.”</p><p>The boy still didn’t say anything, or even look up, and for a second Sam thought he’d overstepped his boundaries, become too personal. But then Nate did look up, his face uncertain, almost puzzled.</p><p>“Did you like your dad?” he asked.</p><p>“My dad...” Sam started, unsure how to proceed, “taught me a lot. He tried.”</p><p>“Mine too,” Nate said. “The stuff he talks about, it freaks me out sometimes, you know? I think he wants me to be like him when I grow up, take over the Historical Society and... everything else. But sometimes...” He shrugged.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“My mom was an artist. I mean, what if I decide to do that instead?”</p><p>“Then you should,” Sam told him. “If that’s what you want to do, you should follow it.”</p><p>Nate frowned again.</p><p>“I still dream about her sometimes, you know? Even though I was so young when she... when it happened.” He blinked at Sam. “Weird, huh?”</p><p>“Are they good dreams?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Then it’s good. That’s your way of remembering her.”</p><p>Not long after, the front door opened and Tommy came back with new clothes. Sam and Dean went upstairs to take turns showering and getting changed.</p><p>As he washed off the dirt and grime of the day, Sam made a mental note to ask the boy more about his mother.</p><p>After Dean and Sam got cleaned up, they all sat back down in the big old-fashioned plantation kitchen, gathered around McClane’s pine table. The windows were open and the night-sounds of crickets and cicadas rippled in through the screens. Far off in the distance, lightning pulsed and flickered in the darkness, followed by the distant rumble of thunder.</p><p>Tommy had the Braves game playing softly on the radio and the reception blurred into static as the storm moved closer.</p><p>“All right,” he said finally. “I’ve waited long enough. You gonna tell me what happened to you out there?”</p><p>Dean cracked a fresh beer while Sam told Tommy and Nate about what they’d seen on the road, the floating black substance that had come oozing from Beauchamp’s remains, and how Dean had seen the same thing coming out of Dave Wolverton’s corpse.</p><p>When Sam finished, Tommy nodded slowly.</p><p>“So the thing about the Moa’ah,” he began, “is it’s the animating force behind the noose, but its presence doesn’t always mean the noose is still nearby. Hell, it can hover around the infected, sometimes for decades, even centuries, until it gets a chance to air out.”</p><p>“I guess nobody told the demons that,” Sam said.</p><p>“Or they’re just that desperate.” Tommy ran one hand thoughtfully over the wood-grain of the table. “If the demons were torturing civilians for information, like you said, that sounds pretty desperate.”</p><p>“What about Sheriff Daniels?” Dean asked. “For that matter, what about my car? And our knife?”</p><p>Tommy nodded.</p><p>“The knife and the car, I can probably help you with,” he said. “But Jacqueline Daniels isn’t a woman you want to mess with.”</p><p>“We saw her Santeria tattoo.”</p><p>“That’s the least of it. Her family goes back to the original battle of Mission’s Ridge.” Tommy’s voice darkened a little, and he glanced over at Nate, who had been sitting in silence at the end of the table, listening intently. “Why don’t you run upstairs and get ready for bed.”</p><p>“Do I have to?”</p><p>Tommy shot him a stern look.</p><p>“You heard me.”</p><p>The boy sulked off, mumbling under his breath, and when his footsteps faded up the stairs, Tommy sat back and opened a little drawer in the table, taking out a pack of American Spirits and a lighter.</p><p>He glanced up at the Winchesters a little sheepishly.</p><p>“You mind? I’ve cut down to one a day, but if I’m going to tell you this story, I think I’m gonna need it.”</p><p>He shook out a cigarette and lit it, inhaled, then sat back and blew a stream of smoke toward the window.</p><p>“You said you saw that tattoo on her wrist. That’s not actually Santeria in the traditional sense. For generations now, the Daniels family has been practicing their own twisted version of backwoods witchcraft. It started with her great-great-great-great grandfather, who came up from the Louisiana bayou back before the war and set up shop outside of Mission’s Ridge. Not long after that, local people started disappearing.”</p><p>“That was Daniels’ ancestor?”</p><p>Tommy nodded. “He started abducting people, slaves and children mainly, to experiment on them. There were rumors of human sacrifice, cannibalism, and vivisection using human subjects while they were still alive and conscious. Daniels was trying out some of the... variations on African rituals he’d learned back in New Orleans.”</p><p>He dragged on the cigarette again. It was almost halfway gone already.</p><p>The kitchen felt darker now.</p><p>“After a year or so,” he continued, “some of the locals got together and lynched him for it. Hung him up and burned him alive. It’s all in the public record, if you care to dig a little. On the night he died, his infant son was whisked away and raised by another family. He grew up to be a Civil War doctor named...”</p><p>“My God.” McClane scraped back his chair and stood up. For the first time he actually looked shaken. “Aristede Percy,” he looked at Sam, “you said when you were reading Beauchamp’s journal that he was the Civil War doctor who supposedly used the powers of the noose to bring Jubal back to life.”</p><p>McClane sank back into his chair, his face alive with the possibilities the connection opened up.</p><p>“Tomorrow marks the two hundred-year anniversary of Daniels’ lynching,” he added. He opened the pack of cigarettes again, considered it briefly then put it away. “The noose’s power will most probably be at its peak. We’ve already seen its effects, even though the actual rope has yet to be recovered.”</p><p>“It’s out there somewhere, though,” Sam said.</p><p>McClane nodded. His face was a grim mask.</p><p>“And Jacqueline Daniels won’t rest until she finds it.”</p><p>“She’s the sheriff,” Sam said. “How do we stop her?”</p><p>“You have to get to it first. Use a special weapon and cut the thing to pieces.”</p><p>“Like a supernatural weapon.” Dean half-laughed, then looked glum. “We had one of those once.”</p><p>“You mean this?”</p><p>McClane reached into a leather sheath on his belt and took out Ruby’s demon-killing knife, sliding it across the table to Dean. The sight of it made Dean’s face light up with such enthusiasm that he almost looked childlike.</p><p>“Where’d you get that?”</p><p>“Let’s just say I’ve got a few connections in the sheriff’s office. Stuff disappears from the evidence cage all the time. Thankfully, Sheriff Daniels doesn’t have any idea what this particular item is capable of. If she did...” McClane shuddered, letting the thought drift away unarticulated.</p><p>“So we’ve got the knife back,” Dean said, his mood darkening again. “What about the Impala?”</p><p>“In the impound lot. We can see about getting it in the morning. I’ll talk to Raymond Ungeroot—he’s one of the deputies down there. Also my nephew.” Dean tossed him a look, and Tommy looked a little chagrined. “What can I say, it’s a real small town.”</p><p>“Any idea where the noose is?” Dean asked.</p><p>“On that score,” McClane said, shaking his head, “I got nothing.”</p><p>“No,” Sam said, “but I might. We’re going to need a ride into town.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The old church was silent.</p><p>Sam and Dean approached the front steps, both holding flashlights that Tommy McClane had supplied.</p><p>Somewhere in the distance a dog yapped twice, howled and fell quiet. It was two a.m., and the narrow side streets of the town had lapsed into a thick, narcoleptic stillness that was as close to slumber as it was going to get.</p><p>“First Pentecostal Church of Mission’s Ridge,” Dean read, and then he turned to Sam.</p><p>Sam shone his flashlight on the cornerstone, looking at the date.</p><p>“Year of Our Lord 1833. It’s the oldest remaining building in town. The one structure the Union army didn’t torch after General Meade whipped the Rebels out on the hill.” He gestured around the side. “And according to what Sarah Rafferty told us, this is where it all changed for Dave Wolverton—on Phil Oiler’s wedding day. I think he and Phil were wandering around down there, and found the noose.”</p><p>“And what, decided to take turns trying it on?”</p><p>“Authentic Civil War relic,” Sam said. “They probably couldn’t resist.”</p><p>He and Dean walked along the outside of the church, following its outer wall toward a back alleyway.</p><p>“Careful,” Sam said, shining his light on the steel tracks running off into the distance.</p><p>“Railroad tracks?” Dean mumbled. “Here?”</p><p>“Remember that armored train? It ran right through town—and right past here.”</p><p>“Crazy,” Dean shrugged. “Well, let’s go to church.”</p><p>The clapboard exterior was massive, seeming to occupy limitless space in all directions. Around the back, Sam’s flashlight picked out a narrow utility stairwell leading down. A plain white door with a square window stood at the bottom.</p><p>Navigating the steps, Dean bent over and picked up a loose brick, wrapped his jacket around it, and punched it through the glass. The window burst and glass tinkled down inside the door. Dean reached through—avoiding the shards—found the knob and turned it.</p><p>Feet crunching over broken glass, they stepped inside.</p><p>Sam went first, shining his flashlight along the walls. Heavy shreds of cobweb hung from the ceiling, and the air was thick with dust. He realized they were standing inside a storage space, a wide, musty room filled with old Bibles and hymnals and racks of choir robes. An old pipe organ towered against the wall, partially disassembled.</p><p>There was a sharp clicking noise.</p><p>Spinning around, Sam caught a glimpse of a figure leaning over them from above and pointed his flashlight at it.</p><p>His heart pounding, he stared at the bloodied face and hands of the wooden statue peering down from its crucifix. The expression on the statue’s face was a combination of suffering and infinite gentleness.</p><p>“Jesus,” Dean breathed. “What’s he doing in the basement?”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe there’s been a shift in the dogma.”</p><p>Dean just gave him a puzzled look.</p><p>“Which way from here?”</p><p>Sam looked at the far end of the storage room, where several divergent hallways ran out in what looked like a half-dozen different directions. Back at the McClanes’ house, Tommy had told them that the church basement was a labyrinth of corridors and sub-chambers, many of which hadn’t been thoroughly cleaned out for a century or more.</p><p>Half the stuff in the Historical Society came from there, he’d told them. But there’s still whole rooms that people haven’t checked out since the Union Army came through. If the noose is anyplace, you’ll most likely find it in one of those.</p><p>They kept walking, neither of them speaking. Dean took half a dozen steps forward and stopped, stomping his foot.</p><p>“It’s metal under here,” he announced. “Hollow.”</p><p>“You mean there’s another layer underneath us?”</p><p>Dean shone his flashlight down.</p><p>“Might be,” he said. “It’s a heavy metal, too, like iron. Lead, maybe. Except...” He sniffed. “...it smells like ammonia.”</p><p>“Ammonia sulfate was an early fire retardant,” Sam said. “Going back to the nineteenth century. They used it in circus tents and army forts. Somebody had something important to protect down there. See if you can find—“</p><p>“A way down?” Dean swung his flashlight directly in front of him, clearly revealing a wide trapezoidal door with a ringbolt. “Like this?”</p><p>“Yeah, just like that.”</p><p>They each grabbed the ring and pulled, swinging the trapdoor upward. The steps leading down were ladder-steep and descended so sharply that they had to clamp their flashlights under their arms so they could hang on with both hands to keep from falling.</p><p>The steps ended abruptly, and left them standing in a dank and airless cube. The walls were lined with what appeared to be lead, grafted together with bolts and rivets. Tufts of what looked like spider webs festooned the upper edges. From where they stood, they did a slow, circular inspection of the space.</p><p>The glow of their flashlights seemed to wither in the outermost pockets of darkness, as if the room itself was sucking the light away in great hungry slurps. Even with the flashlights, there was no way they could see every recessed area at once. Anything could have been waiting for them there.</p><p>“What is this?” Dean asked, his voice flat and hollow, as if he were talking inside a tin can.</p><p>“It looks like an old operating room.” Sam’s flashlight found a table with leather restraints and metal buckles. “Aristede Percy’s old office, I’m guessing.”</p><p>“In the sub-cellar of a church?”</p><p>“Nobody’d think to look down here, would they? And Doc Percy must have figured that even the Union army would leave it be.” His flashlight played along the walls, and he realized that what he’d first thought were cobwebs were actually lines etched into the surface. “Dean, check this out.”</p><p>“Diagrams.” Dean glanced back at Sam. “Doc Percy’s amazing rope tricks.”</p><p>And they were—hundreds of technical drawings, painstakingly detailed, depicting every imaginable type of knot. It was as if Dr. Percy had run through his entire vocabulary of bends, twines, loops and hitches in pursuit of the one true Judas noose.</p><p>“I think we’re close, Dean,” Sam said.</p><p>“I think we’re more than close.”</p><p>Dean pointed his light forward, the beam settling in the middle of the room. At the dead center Sam saw a hole in the lead plates where the otherwise seamless surface had been left open to reveal a square of raw black earth, three feet wide and three feet long. The metallic edges of something heavy and square gleamed inside the dirt, a box the size of a tombstone, its exterior illuminated in the same way Beauchamp’s coffin had shone—with its own unearthly radiance.</p><p>“That’s a reliquary,” Sam said. “I’ll bet that’s what the demons were looking for out on the battlefield.”</p><p>Dean walked over and hunkered down next to it, wiping the dirt away.</p><p>“Someone’s been down here recently. It’s already been dug up, removed, and put back in.”</p><p>Sam bent down beside Dean, found a long metal handle on his end of the box, and they both pulled. The reliquary came out of the dirt without much resistance, and they set it on the lead floor.</p><p>“Be careful,” Sam said.</p><p>“If this is just full of more bones, I’m gonna be so pissed,” Dean said.</p><p>Together, they lifted the lid.</p><p>It wasn’t full of bones.</p><p>The brass interior of the box was so intricately engraved with tiny lines of text and symbols that it reminded Dean of circuitry, the prehistoric ancestor of the modern microchip. Looking at the lid made his head throb. It was as if his mind was trying to take in all the thousands of lines of tiny words without his eyes realizing it—as if the codes and charms of the reliquary were actually leaping fully formed into his consciousness.</p><p>He shut his eyes and turned away.</p><p>Get out, he thought, shaking his head hard. Get the hell out of my head, box.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam’s voice was saying. He sounded shaken as well. “Look.”</p><p>With a grunt, Dean opened his eyes again and looked down, careful to avoid the reliquary’s inner lid. In the middle of the box, curled like a snake on red velvet, he saw the noose itself. Thick, rough rope, stiff with age, its knots dark with a century and a half of spilled blood.</p><p>“So that’s it,” he said. “That’s the noose that Aristede Percy tied.”</p><p>“It really does have seven coils,” Sam said, lifting the noose up and holding it. “Except the seventh one’s hidden, see? It—“</p><p>He froze, the flashlight slipping from his hand, striking the lead-lined floor and rolling in a lazy half-circle to the wall.</p><p>Dean aimed his own flashlight at his brother. Sam was staring at him wide-eyed, the noose still held loosely in his fingers, his expression a portrait of sheer, unvarnished panic, its message horribly clear: I can’t breathe.</p><p>Under his chin, a ring of shadowy indentation rippled against his throat, squeezing off his windpipe, as if invisible tension wires were cranking tighter into his skin. Sam’s eyes bulged, mouth opening and closing, unable to produce more than muted glottal clicks.</p><p>He fell to his knees.</p><p>“Hang on, Sam. Hang on, bro. I’m gonna cut you out of this thing, once and for all.”</p><p>Being careful not to touch the noose, Dean used his flashlight to knock it from his brother’s hand. It hit the floor with a heavy thwop, as if it was sopping wet.</p><p>Wedging his flashlight under his arm, Dean reached back to the sheath on his belt, groping for the demon-killing knife.</p><p>But the sheath was empty.</p><p>The knife was gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the floor of the room, Sam was helplessly staring up at Dean. His face, formerly white, had begun tingeing a cyanic shade of blue as the first signs of irreversible oxygen deprivation sank deeper into his features.</p><p>Finding a loose handle, he picked the noose up and dropped it back into the box. Then Dean whirled around and splashed the white beam of his flashlight around the room.</p><p>When did I lose the knife?</p><p>Wouldn’t he have heard it, if it had fallen out of his pocket onto the metal floor?</p><p>What if I lost it earlier? Outside, or up in one of the other rooms?</p><p>He looked back at the floor. Sam was tilting slightly to one side now, unable even to sit upright. The look of panic had started sliding away, along with his sense of awareness.</p><p>Dean hunched down and lifted his brother back up, searching for a spark of life in his eyes.</p><p>He’s going to pass out, a mental voice yammered. He’s not getting any air. I have to do something.</p><p>He flashed hard to something an ambulance driver had told him once.</p><p>When you’re dealing with a choking victim, you don’t have time to mess around. Time is brain.</p><p>There was no time to go looking for the knife.</p><p>Desperate, out of options, Dean swung his brother in front of him, wrapping his arms around him from behind. He made a fist with one hand and locked his other hand around it, thrusting up and into Sam’s diaphragm.</p><p>At first nothing happened.</p><p>Dean did it again, harder.</p><p>Sam made an abrupt hiccuping croak and something flew up and out of his mouth, landing on the floor with a clank.</p><p>Sam whooped in a deep, rattling breath.</p><p>“You all right?” Dean asked tautly.</p><p>Sam managed a weak nod. His eyes and nose were streaming with tears, and dirt streaked his face like warpaint. For a moment he looked about six years old, freshly fallen off his bike with a skinned knee.</p><p>“What...” he rasped. “What came out of me?”</p><p>Dean aimed his flashlight over the lead-lined floor, training it on the small, wet leather pouch that lay five feet away from them. Its drawstring had come open. A few tarnished silver pieces lay scattered around it, gleaming there like flat, incurious eyes.</p><p>“Thirty pieces of silver—shekels of Tyre,” Dean whispered, turning his attention back to the reliquary. “The noose...”</p><p>There was a faint clinking noise. He twitched the flashlight back at the bag of silver pieces again.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam’s voice came hoarsely. “What...?”</p><p>From the far corner came a shuffling noise.</p><p>“We’re not alone down here,” Dean said.</p><p>He looked at the spilled coins.</p><p>A long, slender hand dipped out of the darkness and plucked one of them up.</p><p>Dean jerked the flashlight upward to reveal a bearded face, grinning wildly at them.</p><p>The figure stepped forward. He was tall and skeletal, and except for his thick black facial hair, his skin appeared almost unnaturally white and smooth. But moist as well—less like porcelain and more like the flesh of a mushroom. From the emaciated hunch of his shoulders, a colorless, shabby-looking cloak hung down to the floor, its hood thrown back. The hem of the figure’s robe dragged on the floor.</p><p>“I believe this belongs to me.” Kneeling, the figure began to scrape the silver coins up, depositing them carefully back into the satchel from which they’d spilled. The satchel then disappeared under the cloak.</p><p>“Judas?” Dean whispered in disbelief.</p><p>“No. I’m more of an aide-de-camp.” The man looked up again, and this time Dean saw his eyes, their orbits stained an absolute, soulless black.</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. “Another scum-sucking demon. Just what we—“</p><p>“I am not a demon.” The figure’s arms shot forward, taking hold of Dean’s throat and jerking him off his feet and straight up into the air. His flashlight slipped from his fingers and went out. There was a weightless, spinning moment in the dark when Dean had time to think, This is gonna hurt, and then something flat and hard—the floor, the wall—collided with his skull, ringing it like a bell.</p><p>His vision doubled, then tripled. Constellations—whole galaxies of stars—rattled through his head, and when he tried to sit up, all he could taste was the coppery trickle of his own blood.</p><p>“You sure... you’re not a demon?” he croacked.</p><p>“I’m a Collector,” the figure said. “Probably the closest term you have for me is spirit. Except that I inhabit a solid form. Case in point...” He drew back one foot with crazy, stuttering speed and swung it forward, smashing Dean hard in the head.</p><p>It was a perfectly placed kick, connecting just above the ear, and Dean felt the world closing down around him fast, like a tent whose poles had been yanked away.</p><p>Sam grabbed his flashlight and swept it up until he saw the Collector coming toward him. Its robe swung heavily back and forth, jingling as it walked. As it got closer Sam realized that the garment was loaded with pockets, perhaps hundreds of them, each containing leather pouches and satchels of silver pieces. It had to weigh half a ton.</p><p>“Where’s Judas?”</p><p>“He couldn’t make it,” the figure responded. “Sends his regards.”</p><p>“Is this what you do?” Sam asked. “Go around for all eternity, picking up blood money?”</p><p>“At least I didn’t trigger the Apocalypse,” the Collector replied. It smiled. “Not that I’m complaining. My employer is back on the A-list again. Suddenly everybody wants the noose—humanity, lesser demons, witches.” He shrugged, clinking. “It’s a bull market on betrayal.”</p><p>Sam looked around. There was only one weapon he could see in the room. He picked up the reliquary and threw it as hard as he could at the creature.</p><p>Laughing, the Collector ducked.</p><p>The box slammed off the wall and landed between them. The Collector stepped over it and blurred toward him, one arm pinioning forward. When the punch connected, it was with the full weight of all the metal loaded in the sleeves, as if the thing’s entire body was packed with the silver it had been gathering.</p><p>Sam’s head jolted backward and bounced off the wall. He dropped the flashlight. Every ounce of light in the room was now gone.</p><p>But he could hear something, a sound he recognized.</p><p>The scrape of metal against metal. It was a thin, hard sound, and when Sam looked up, he actually saw a few sparks flying along the floor. It wasn’t much, but it was enough for him to glimpse, however briefly, the tip of a gleaming steel blade in the Collector’s pale hand.</p><p>“Did you really think that I would just let you traipse into my house,” the voice in the darkness murmured, “with your filthy little weapon?”</p><p>A sharp beam of light burst out from the doorway, illuminating the room around them.</p><p>“What makes you think it’s your house, you son of a bitch?” Tommy McClane’s voice asked.</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Through concussion-glazed eyes, Sam gazed back at the steep stairs leading up and out.</p><p>Tommy was standing in the doorway with his flashlight pointed at the Collector, while Nate flanked him, his own flashlight steady in his small hand. Neither of them made a move to come any closer.</p><p>Smart guys, Sam thought foggily. You don’t want any part of this.</p><p>“Sam?” Tommy said. “Dean? You two okay?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer, but Sam sat up and looked at him.</p><p>“Okay’s not exactly the word I’d use,” he said. “You were supposed to go home after you dropped us off.”</p><p>“It’s ‘Bring a Friend to Church Day,’” Tommy said, but he didn’t take his eyes off the figure standing in front of him. Sam saw the demon-knife clearly now, still shining in the Collector’s hand. “Give me the blade,” Tommy said, “and the noose.”</p><p>The Collector made a brief clucking sound that might have been a laugh.</p><p>“If you want it so much, come in and get it yourself.”</p><p>“We don’t have to.”</p><p>“That’s what I thought.” The Collector shook his head. “You have no idea what you’re dealing with.”</p><p>“I guess we’ll see about that,” Tommy shrugged. “Go ahead, son.”</p><p>Still standing in the doorway, Nate reached into his back pocket and pulled out a piece of yellow parchment, unfolding it nimbly and pointing the flashlight at it. It looked very big in his hand.</p><p>He began to read.</p><p>The incantation was a mix of French and Latin and some other lyrical language Sam didn’t recognize. Nate’s high, sweet voice make the words sound almost like a song.</p><p>“What’s this?” the Collector asked.</p><p>“Hoodoo binding charm.”</p><p>“I’m honored,” he said. “Unfortunately, as long as I’m able to block it out with the sound of my own voice—“</p><p>Sam saw Dean rise up behind the cloaked figure. Dean was holding the noose’s reliquary over his head, and he swung it down with a sharp, hard bang. The Collector tumbled forward, the blade flying from his hand, his pockets spilling open, his robe ringing out with loads of spilled silver coins.</p><p>“Block that, you son of a bitch,” Dean grunted as Sam grabbed the demon-knife. “Do it, Sam.”</p><p>Sam didn’t need to be prompted. He raised the knife and shoved it down into the Collector’s chest.</p><p>The Collector screamed, thrashing, but didn’t flash out.</p><p>“Moneybags was telling the truth,” Dean said. “Not a demon. Oh well. I guess that’s—“</p><p>The Collector jerked upright again, his face a howling tunnel of rage and violence, and lunged at Sam with both hands.</p><p>His fingers locked around Sam’s throat, holding him at arms’ length as he had with Dean when he’d endeavored to crush Dean’s windpipe.</p><p>Sam’s reaction was pure instinct. His right hand came straight up, driving the demon-knife hard and fast. The thrust planted the blade back in the Collector’s chest, in the area where Sam presumed the heart would be, if the Collector had one. The figure shrieked, a strangled, failing cry, and Sam stabbed him again, twice more, until the Collector fell.</p><p>Hitting the floor, he lay totally still.</p><p>Panting, catching his breath, Sam stepped back, watching for any further sign of life. But there was none forthcoming.</p><p>“What about the noose?” Tommy asked from the doorway. “Just don’t touch it with your bare hands.”</p><p>“Yeah, we figured that out.” Sam handed the knife to Dean, then bent down, hands still trembling a little, and cut a strip of fabric from the Collector’s cloak, wrapping it around his palm like a glove. Duly protected, he lifted the noose from the floor—it seemed somehow heavier than it should have—then fired a glance at Tommy.</p><p>“I hope you’ve got transportation out of here. I don’t want to hold onto this thing any longer than I have to.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It was 3:05 a.m. when Jacqueline Daniels walked into her office, switched on the light, and saw the man standing next to her desk. He had been waiting there in the dark for her, and for a moment she was so surprised that she couldn’t speak.</p><p>“You,” she managed.</p><p>The man stood perfectly still, looking back at her with dark-eyed intensity. The trench coat he’d been wearing earlier hung open, and she couldn’t see any kind of weapon in his hands or on his person.</p><p>Somehow that made him seem even more dangerous.</p><p>“How did you get in here?”</p><p>“Please sit down.”</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“We need to talk.”</p><p>Daniels felt a surge of adrenaline in her temples, a sensation like hot coins being pressed on either side of her head. After the collision out on the road, she had spent the rest of the day out looking for the Winchesters. The FBI had joined in the manhunt, and their involvement had only made her job more complicated.</p><p>“We need to talk,” he repeated.</p><p>“You’re under arrest,” she told him. “That stunt out on the highway today is more than enough reason to lock you up.”</p><p>Turning, she started away from him, but the man raised one hand and the door slammed shut in front of her face.</p><p>“Now please sit down,” he instructed.</p><p>Daniels turned back to face him. She dropped the pretense of ballsy, hard-case female law enforcement. It was replaced by something somehow harder—an air of cold, almost clinical detachment.</p><p>“You have no idea what you’re dealing with,” she said flatly.</p><p>“My name is Castiel.”</p><p>“I don’t care what you call yourself.” Walking back to the desk, she reached around for her handcuffs and felt a sharp sting of pain fork up the back of her neck, the result of the car accident earlier. “You think you can just waltz in here, into my office, and start ordering me around?”</p><p>“This is bigger than you.”</p><p>“Nothing in this town is bigger than me.” She brought the cuffs forward, but Castiel caught her wrist and held it tightly. With a quick, effortless flick, he turned it over to reveal the tattoo imprinted on her skin. He touched it lightly.</p><p>“This sigil won’t protect you.”</p><p>A flicker of doubt wavered over Daniels’ face, and then was gone.</p><p>“You like that?” she said. “I got it at Mardi Gras, spring break twelve years ago. Dumb kid stuff, I know, but...”</p><p>“You’re lying to me.”</p><p>“What if I am? Why should I care what you think?”</p><p>“Time is short,” Castiel said. “I need the Witness. Judas. Where is he?”</p><p>Daniels shook her head.</p><p>“I haven’t got the faintest idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“You know about the noose. It disappeared twice while it was under your care.” His eyes flicked down at the sigil again. “I know that mark.”</p><p>She said nothing.</p><p>“Direct me to my Witness,” he demanded. “I won’t ask again.”</p><p>The sheriff didn’t move, allowing Castiel to hold onto her hand for another moment, the Santeria tattoo hovering between them like some small but vital lie that had been found out.</p><p>Then, unexpectedly, she smiled, and drew her hand back from him.</p><p>“Ask all you want, Castiel... or whatever your name is. Poke around my head. Make yourself comfortable. Stay all night.” The smile disappeared. “I don’t know anything.”</p><p>Castiel’s entire face tightened. Although he didn’t actually move forward, he seemed to get both larger and somehow more imposing until his presence filled her entire field of view. His voice trembled with barely suppressed rage.</p><p>“I am an Angel of the Lord,” he said. “Simply being here has cost me valuable time. Time that I will never get back. This is important.”</p><p>Daniels stepped back, her eyes widening, feeling her autonomic nervous system respond—sweat prickled under her arms and her pulse quickened in her throat, where she could feel it pumping in her neck. Then she forced herself to calm down again.</p><p>“If you really were an angel,” she said, like a stern mother facing an errant child, “you wouldn’t need me to point you in the right direction, would you?” She shook her head. “Sorry. This is my town. My people have been here since long before you arrived, and we’ll be here taking care of things long after you leave.” She blew back a wisp of hair that had fallen over her eyes. “Now if you’re done with the questions, I’m going home to take some aspirin. Some douche bag wrecked my car today, and I’ve got one hell of a headache.”</p><p>Castiel reached out, his fingers brushing her forehead, almost casually.</p><p>“It’s about to get much worse.”</p><p>Sheriff Daniels opened her mouth to answer, and then clapped it shut again. Her mind was flooded with images and sensations—blinding light and threatening darkness, righteous anger, walking the battlefields of history, and grace, divine grace.</p><p>“I won’t ask again,” Castiel said. “Where is the noose?”</p><p>This time Daniels didn’t hesitate. Although she didn’t realize it, she had fallen to her knees, and her voice—not ballsy, not anymore, not at all—was spewing out the words without so much as a qualm.</p><p>“The church. It’s in the basement of the church,” she said.</p><p>By the time the overwhelming sensations had finally faded, leaving behind the mother of all migraines, Castiel was gone.</p><p>Making her way slowly to her feet, Sheriff Jacqueline Daniels staggered the rest of the way to her desk chair and collapsed into it, cradling her face in her hands.</p><p>She could scarcely bear to think of what she’d done.</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and Dean left the church the way they had come in. Father and son followed the Winchesters out of the door without comment. Tommy’s pickup was parked behind the rear entrance, Sam climbed into the front seat, sitting in the middle and still holding the noose.</p><p>A footstep scraped in the shadows behind them, and Dean turned to see Castiel stepping out of the alleyway.</p><p>“Whoa.” Tommy raised his flashlight. “Who the hell are you?”</p><p>“Easy,” Dean said. “He’s okay.”</p><p>“Where is he?” Castiel’s eyes were locked on the noose in Sam’s hand. His voice was tight with urgency. “Did you see him?”</p><p>“The Witness?” Dean shook his head. “Sorry, Cass—he sent his stunt-double. A Collector. Guy didn’t know squat.”</p><p>“We’ll see what he tells me,” Castiel said, brushing past them on his way down the stairs, toward the back entrance of the church.</p><p>“Ah, Cass...? I don’t think that’s gonna happen either.”</p><p>The angel stopped and looked back. “What?”</p><p>“Sam kind of... killed him.”</p><p>“What?” Castiel glared at him, appalled. “What were you thinking?”</p><p>“It was him or me,” Sam said from the cab of the truck.</p><p>“I don’t think you realize what this is going to cost us,” Castiel said. “Neither of you do. Your selfishness might have cost us our last chance.”</p><p>“His selfishness kept him alive,” Dean countered.</p><p>Castiel’s expression of thinly veiled outrage didn’t change. He seemed to be on the verge of saying something—perhaps a great many things. In the end he simply turned and descended the back steps.</p><p>Tommy exhaled.</p><p>“Should I ask?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said. With a shrug that was more tired than resigned, Tommy crossed the alley to where the pickup was parked and opened the passenger door for Dean.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Dean said, “let the kid ride up front. It’s the middle of the night.”</p><p>“You’re in worse shape than he is,” Tommy said. “Besides, he’s got something back there to keep him occupied.”</p><p>“You mean, like a game?”</p><p>Tommy gave a distracted nod.</p><p>“Something like that.”</p><p>They drove away from the church and down the empty, moonlit alleyway. Tommy steered easily through town, glancing at the noose that Sam still held on his lap, carefully protected by the swath of torn fabric. On the radio, the Marshall Tucker Band was playing ‘Can’t You See.’</p><p>“It’s funny,” he said thoughtfully, “you hear stories about something for your whole life and when you finally find it, it’s almost a let-down, you know?”</p><p>“We need to destroy it,” Sam said. “Sooner rather than later.”</p><p>“On the battleground,” Tommy said. “That’s where it’s got to happen.”</p><p>“Why there?”</p><p>“Because that’s where it was first tied. Aristede Percy put it together in a medical tent. Used the same knots that he used to stitch up the corpse of Jubal Beauchamp.”</p><p>Dean’s phone chimed. He pulled it out and looked at the screen.</p><p>“Huh, must have recovered from its dunking in the swamp,” he said, and hit TALK. “Hey, Bobby.”</p><p>Sam watched his brother peering at the blade in his hands while listening to what Bobby was saying.</p><p>“Bobby, what’s happening, man?” Bobby’s voice was a buzz, the words not clear enough to make out. “What? Yeah, we did.” He looked over at the noose on Sam’s lap, and then at the blade again. “We’re getting ready to do it now. Out on the battleground.” He raised an eyebrow at Tommy. “How much further is it?”</p><p>“We’re almost there,” Tommy replied. “See?”</p><p>Outside the window, the hillside loomed in the moonlight, though the first hints of pre-dawn light were appearing in the east. Sam could just make out the shapes of tents still spread out across it, between the craters. He remembered what Sarah had said about the re-enactors refusing to leave camp until somebody explained what had happened to their compatriots.</p><p>“So yeah, we’re...” Dean stopped. “What? Say that again?”</p><p>The pickup crunched across the parking lot and came to a halt. Before Sam could ask what was happening, he heard something thumping in the back of the truck. The tarp that had covered him and Dean on the way back from the swamp was shifting around. There was a clatter of commotion underneath it, like kicking feet or thudding fists. Sam peered over his shoulder, but it was too dark to see what was happening.</p><p>“Tommy? Is Nate okay back there?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Tommy said. “He can take care of himself.”</p><p>“Are you sure? He’s only what? Eleven? “</p><p>“Wait a second,” Dean cut in, his voice sharp with urgency, “Bobby says we’re not supposed to cut up the noose. He says if you do that—“</p><p>Something in the back of the truck screamed.</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean jumped out and ran around the back.</p><p>He grabbed the tarp and ripped it back. What he saw beneath it took several seconds to understand. There were two figures struggling in the shadows, one pinning the other down, smashing its victim with a series of fast, brutal punches. The screams grew louder, more intense.</p><p>“Leave him alone!” Dean shouted and gripped the attacker around one arm, swinging him back. As the figure spun around, he realized that the arm he was holding onto belonged to Nate McClane.</p><p>“What...?”</p><p>The boy gave him a savage grin. Dean turned to stare at the half-conscious face of the victim looking back from the bottom of the truck. He realized that he was looking down at Sarah Rafferty.</p><p>“Sarah?”</p><p>She groaned, lips barely managing to shape the words.</p><p>“Help...”</p><p>“What did you do to her?” Dean asked, spinning back around to look at Nate.</p><p>The boy was still grinning, his lips peeled back to reveal every tooth in his mouth.</p><p>His eyes flicked black.</p><p>Up in front, both doors of the pickup flew open. Sam jumped down and a moment later Tommy McClane stepped out on his side, sidling unhurriedly toward the back of the truck.</p><p>McClane’s grin matched his son’s. The insides of his eyes seemed to have filled with thick black ink. A shroud of moonlight lay over him like an unearthly cowl.</p><p>“We took the girl to play with,” McClane said, “just for fun. Kind of a nice reward, don’t you think? Sure as hell beats an e-book.”</p><p>“You did all this just so you could get your hands on the noose?” Dean said.</p><p>“Let’s just say that Judas and his Collectors were a little too selfish when it came to letting everybody have a turn with it,” the McClane-demon sneered. “So me and my kin just started looking around for it ourselves.”</p><p>Dean thought of the demons they’d encountered on the hillside, and the ones out on the country highway.</p><p>“Your kin.”</p><p>“We’ve got plans,” McClane said. “Big plans.”</p><p>Dean shook his head.</p><p>“Dammit! I knew I had you pegged right the first time.”</p><p>“We could never have set foot inside that room.” McClane nodded. “But you did it for us.” He glanced at the Nate-demon. “Go ahead. Finish her off.”</p><p>Nate lunged toward Sarah Rafferty with a snarl. Sam grabbed him by the shoulders and slammed his face into the side of the truck. The demon’s head bounced off and slumped away.</p><p>He felt something ripped away from him and realized that the noose was gone—he’d lost it when he’d grabbed the demon.</p><p>McClane had it now. Almost faster than Sam’s eyes could process, the demon lashed out with it, looping the coil around Dean’s wrist and yanking the blade from his hand.</p><p>Sam started to charge toward McClane, and pain exploded through his head from behind, blasting his vision into a kaleidoscope of shattered rhinestone. When he staggered around, he saw Nate grinning at him again, rubbing his fist. And behind the demon, he glimpsed Sarah crawling away, inching slowly, painfully, away into the darkness.</p><p>Off to his left, McClane had Dean on his knees and was kicking him. Dean struggled to his feet and McClane kicked him again, harder. The cold clatter of his laugh was like someone spilling a bag of marbles across a museum floor. There was nothing human in it.</p><p>“You ready?” he asked, and Nate nodded. The look of unwholesome eagerness scrawled over the boy’s face was almost obscene.</p><p>Raising the knife, McClane stuck its tip into the first of the noose’s coils, shoving it upward. Sam heard a ripping noise as the blade tore through the weave of the hemp.</p><p>Black ooze spurted from the rope like drainage from an infected loop of bowel, trickling down McClane’s hands and up to his elbows.</p><p>Seeing it, Sam remembered how heavy the rope had felt, and realized that was because it was alive and pulsating, nearly sloshing in Tommy’s hands. He stared as the black substance rose up, shimmering in the night air, moving the way they’d seen it move in the back of the morgue van.</p><p>The Moa’ah.</p><p>It swirled over their heads and flung itself outward, across the battlefield and up the hill, a streak of greater blackness against the gloom that preceded sunrise.</p><p>A sudden eruption of thunder shook the world, lights flashing and shivering over the hillside, illuminating the full curvature of the landscape in a series of silent-movie flickers.</p><p>No, Sam realized, not thunder.</p><p>Guns.</p><p>Up on top of the hill, figures began to appear, manning the siege howitzers that the state police had not been able to bring down. More of them rose up every second.</p><p>They seemed to be rising up out of the ground itself.</p><p>But they weren’t—the meat-suits they wore were the bodies of the re-enactors who had refused to abandon the battlefield.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Ah.” Reaching the final loop, McClane changed the angle of the blade, as if anticipating greater resistance. “The seventh coil. Now you’re going to see why Judas wants to keep the noose so closely protected.”</p><p>Dean swung at him.</p><p>It should have worked. McClane wasn’t even looking at him—he was still apparently absorbed by the task at hand. But when Dean’s fist came at him, McClane switched hands with the noose, then reached up almost casually and gripped Dean by the wrist, swinging him around sideways and applying pressure to his radial nerve.</p><p>A thin lancet of icy-hot pain sprang up Dean’s arm and his knees went out from under him, dropping him to the ground.</p><p>“Nate?” McClane called out. From inside the cab of the truck, Nate stepped out holding what Sam Winchester recognized as a Civil War musket from the gun rack. Wielding the gun with ease, the boy aimed and pulled the trigger. There was a flat, eardrum-rending report as the muzzle-flash ignited the air in front of him. Dean flailed backward, twisted and was landed face-first in the dirt.</p><p>“Dean!” Sam shouted.</p><p>McClane turned and eyed him speculatively.</p><p>“I hope you’re gonna be a little tougher to crack,” he said, drawing the demon-blade, tipping it back and throwing it at Sam at point-blank range.</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Jacqueline Daniels’ head continued to throb mercilessly.</p><p>It was four in the morning and she was still in her office. She had called her deputy, Jerry, in from the stakeout at the Winchesters’ motel. He had arrived along with Sergeant Earl Ray Harris and a handful of State Troopers, plus an FBI agent.</p><p>She couldn’t tell them about the noose, or the thirty silver pieces that she’d removed from the battlefield, or her recent excavations in the basement of the First Pentecostal Church of Mission’s Ridge.</p><p>She definitely couldn’t reveal the recent visit from the self-proclaimed angel in a trench coat who had called himself Castiel. And besides, even if she told them the truth, none of them would believe her.</p><p>“Let’s go over what happened out on the highway again,” said the FBI officer, a slicked-back thirty-something careerist named Andrew Tremont. In the last hour or so, Sheriff Daniels had silently upgraded Agent Tremont’s status from localized pain-in-the-ass to world-class hemorrhoid as his questions had become less random and more focused on how and when her particular investigation had fallen apart.</p><p>Also, he was drinking her coffee—the good stuff, the French Roast that she normally kept hidden under the microwave.</p><p>“You said someone stepped out in the middle of the road, in front of your cruiser, and forced you to stop. You have reason to believe this person was working with the two men?”</p><p>“I already told you that—we’re just wasting time,” Daniels said. “Besides, I’m not the one under investigation here.”</p><p>Tremont lifted his mug to his lips and sipped noisily.</p><p>“May I remind you, Sheriff, that you called us.”</p><p>“To help me catch a couple of men who were impersonating Federal Agents, not to pick my investigation to pieces.”</p><p>“I submit that our goals might not be mutually exclusive.” Another two ounces of premium coffee disappeared into Tremont’s mouth. “Now, two of our DMORT workers claim they saw you taking something from the corpse of Phil Oiler and placing it in a bag,” Tremont said. “One of them said that it jingled.”</p><p>“Jingled?”</p><p>“Like coins. Can you tell me anything about that?”</p><p>“That’s right. I stole a bag of quarters from a corpse.” Daniels knuckled her eyes and waited for one of the State Troopers—or even her own deputy, for that matter—to stick up for her. Jerry hadn’t even had the consideration to stay awake.</p><p>When none of them spoke, she glared back up at the Fed.</p><p>“Look, Agent Tremont...”</p><p>“That’s a very interesting tattoo on your wrist, Sheriff. Might I ask after its provenance?”</p><p>“Its what—?”</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>Everybody jumped up and scraped back their chairs.</p><p>“Not again,” Jerry moaned, sitting up in the seat where he’d been drowsing.</p><p>Tremont stiffened, then stood, wiped the spilled coffee from his shirt cuff and put the cup aside, heading toward the front window to look out onto the street.</p><p>“Who do you have stationed out at the battlefield?” Daniels asked Sergeant Harris.</p><p>“Two details,” Harris said. “At midnight they were still trying to get those re-enactors to leave.”</p><p>Nobody else spoke.</p><p>They headed out.</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam ducked the blade.</p><p>It hissed past his head like a low-flying comet, and when he came up again, both Tommy and Nate McClane were barreling toward him. Nate had discarded the gun and was circling about looking for the demon-killing knife.</p><p>BOOM!</p><p>The skyline erupted with the biggest explosion yet, heaving up vast ripples of convulsed air that blew back Sam’s hair and made the pickup jounce sideways on its shocks. He sprang up into the back of the truck, kicked out the window above the gun rack, and yanked down the shotgun and the canister of salt.</p><p>He broke the weapon open, dumped in salt and worked the action.</p><p>He pointed it down at Nate.</p><p>The boy froze.</p><p>“Please, mister.” All at once the young face went smooth and innocent, becoming that of an average kid—one who’d stumbled in far over his head. His eyes had changed from black to a pale blue, and they were filling with frightened tears. “You don’t know what it’s like.”</p><p>Sam took a breath.</p><p>“Yes,” he said, “I do.”</p><p>“Just give me a chance.”</p><p>It’s a trap. And if you fall for it, you’re an even bigger idiot than I thought.</p><p>Still...</p><p>Sam hesitated. The shotgun felt very heavy in his grip now. He lowered the gun a fraction...</p><p>And the Nate-demon lunged for him.</p><p>Sam had the shotgun back up instantly.</p><p>He pulled the trigger.</p><p>The barrel roared, a storm of rock salt blasting from its muzzle, tearing the demon down. A child-sized raft of living smoke came shrieking out of Nate’s skin, and somewhere off to the left, Sam heard Tommy McClane start to scream. Obscenities spilled from his lips, curses in a dozen different languages. Sam didn’t wait around to hear the translation.</p><p>Squirming through the broken back window into the pickup’s cab, he dropped into the driver’s seat. The keys were still in the ignition. He cranked them, dropped the truck into reverse, spun the wheel and floored the gas, flinging the pickup back around.</p><p>Up ahead in the headlights, he saw Tommy McClane staring straight at him.</p><p>But Dean was gone.</p><p>Pinned by the headlights of the oncoming truck, the thing that called itself Tommy McClane stood his ground.</p><p>He’d lost the last coil of the noose somewhere.</p><p>This wasn’t the plan, gunning the Winchesters down in the middle of the battle before the endgame was achieved. But the plan hadn’t included the sight of his son being shredded by a shotgun full of rock salt either. When the demon had seen that...</p><p>Oh, when he had seen that...</p><p>McClane’s jaw tightened. Rage lay heavy against his heart like the flat surface of a branding iron. He wasn’t thinking straight. He cast around quickly for something to throw and came up with a short timber post that had been dislodged from somewhere. He hurled it with all his strength at the truck. The glass crazed on impact, and Sam Winchester ducked reflexively, but then quickly sat back up behind the wheel.</p><p>McClane could see Sam’s face through the windshield, and it was a mirror of his own anger.</p><p>At the last second, he dove out of the way, letting the pickup squeal past him.</p><p>Sam swerved across the parking lot and spun the pickup around. He couldn’t see Dean anywhere, and he was running out of time.</p><p>Up on the hill, the siege howitzers were blasting to pieces whatever remained of the night. The onslaught was so unrelenting that it was impossible to discern the gunfire from the echoes. In the east, the glow of dawn shuddered along the rim of the Earth, low and red and trickling through the treetops, as if the sky itself was bleeding from the attack.</p><p>Sam steered the pickup around again, heading for the battlefield, the tents and the trees. Somewhere off to his left he could make out the Civil War steam locomotive by the old railway shed. Between the explosions, over the pickup truck’s engine, he heard screaming.</p><p>He looked over at the figures in uniform, storming down the hill. Some wore blue, others gray. They were running down the incline side-by-side regardless of sides, like the fulfillment of some ancient prophecy.</p><p>And behold, the Yankee shall campaign with the Rebel.</p><p>All carried authentic-looking Civil War weapons. And although Sam Winchester couldn’t know for sure at this distance, in this misty, smoke shrouded pre-dawn light, he had the sick feeling that every single one of them had the same onyx-black eyes.</p><p>He thought of what McClane had said.</p><p>“My kin.”</p><p>Dean, he thought miserably, where are you?</p><p>Up ahead of him, men had already come out of the tents. Re-enactors—the ones whose bodies the demons hadn’t possessed—were standing in their skivvies and long underwear and gaping up at the wave of figures storming down the hillside. The pickup’s headlights strafed their faces, revealing the slack disbelief of sleepers who’d awakened from a nightmare only to find that the nightmare had followed them into reality.</p><p>There was another artillery flash from above, the boom following instantly afterward, the long shadows of the attackers flickering forward over the grass and down like the fingers of some unthinkably vast and clutching claw.</p><p>“Look out!” Sam palmed the pickup’s horn and held it down. Its nasal beep was absurdly small against the roar of battle. “Get out of here! Run!”</p><p>The pickup hit a bump and slammed violently upward, coming down hard on its shocks with a suspension-busting crack. Sam saw the tents and the men, the trees and creek and the hillside beyond it, all of it closer now, but his brother wasn’t there, wasn’t anywhere, and if he didn’t find him soon—</p><p>A figure burst out of the trees in front of him, darting through his headlights, fifteen feet away. Sam had just enough time to recognize her, the name kiting briefly across his conscious mind—</p><p>Sarah Rafferty.</p><p>—when the biggest howitzer shell yet hit the pickup head-on, blasting it sideways and up into the air, pinwheeling Sam Winchester with it, out of the blue and into the black.</p><p>The truck hit the ground, torn open and bleeding flame.</p><p>It was exactly five a.m.</p><h2><span id="chapter-28">CHAPTER 28</span><a href="#chapter-28" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Get up.</p><p>It was his father’s voice. Dean would have recognized it anywhere. Even if the old man hadn’t been standing directly in front of him, gazing down, looking supremely unimpressed with the string of events that had led up to this.</p><p>I can’t, Dad. A jumble of impressions and responses floundered ineffectively in Dean’s mind. I’m shot. Son of a bitch shot me. You saw it.</p><p>What I saw was a man get blindsided by his own stupidity, John Winchester responded unsympathetically. I saw a man who—given his circumstances and the sheer latitude of his folly—is lucky he’s not dead.</p><p>Dad, how come you’re talking like Abraham Lincoln? Dean thought, and that was when he realized that his father was actually dressed like Lincoln, right down to the beard and stovetop hat. Despite the searing, white-hot pain in his chest and right shoulder, the idea struck him as absurdly funny. Here he was, balled up in the edge of the parking lot, trying to staunch the flow of blood from the grapeshot that had come flying out of a vintage Civil War musket. With no less than the Great Emancipator himself, as real as he’d appeared in Phil Wagner’s wax museum, towering over him.</p><p>Dad...?</p><p>Dean reached up.</p><p>Fought to stand upright.</p><p>And touched cold metal.</p><p>Lincoln, his father, was a statue.</p><p>Not a man at all. A bronze likeness. Craggy and hard. It stood on a concrete base overlooking the battlefield, one hand extended permanently northward, as if pointing out to Mission’s Ridge the cause of its inevitable loss.</p><p>Dean felt the world pivoting away from him on greasy hinges, and all equilibrium fled.</p><p>Then he was actually clinging to the statue, gripping Honest Abe’s arm to hold himself upright.</p><p>How much blood have I lost anyway?</p><p>Sirens howled in the distance, approaching at speed. Above them, Dean heard the screaming—the Rebel Yell coming down the hillside, although all it reminded him of was whiskey and Billy Idol.</p><p>His brain struggled to take it all in.</p><p>Tommy McClane had grabbed the knife and he’d unleashed... this.</p><p>Dean narrowed his eyes and saw the pickup truck—Tommy McClane’s truck, the traitorous bastard—swerving madly across the grass of the battlefield, between explosions. Whoever was behind the wheel looked like they were driving with their feet.</p><p>But where’s Sam?</p><p>The question blazed a new line of clarity across his thoughts, temporarily anyway, long enough to realize that what he was dealing with was essentially a flesh wound, and wasn’t that a nice deceptive turn of phrase? Only a flesh wound.</p><p>And just like that, here came Harvey Keitel in Reservoir Dogs: Aside from the knee cap, the gut’s the worst place you can get shot. It hurts like hell, but you ain’t dying. And good God, would the pop culture stuff ever stop coming, even in moments of profound physical agony?</p><p>Now red and blue bubble lights were flashing across the parking lot. Sheriff’s vehicles.</p><p>Cops.</p><p>“Great,” Dean muttered. “Perfect. It’s gotta—“</p><p>THOOM!</p><p>Off to his right, maybe less than a hundred yards away, an artillery shell hit the Ford’s backbed, blasting it sky-high, spinning it up into the air like a Matchbox car whose youthful owner had lost interest in it.</p><p>In the startled hush that followed, he heard tires screeching, spraying gravel. Doors opening. Voices. Cop voices.</p><p>“It’s you,” a voice said.</p><p>Dean let go of the statue’s arm and staggered around to find himself face-to-face with McClane. The bastard was no longer armed, but in all honesty, Dean didn’t suppose he would even need a weapon now. McClane could poke him with a sharp stick and get the job done.</p><p>Bull. I ain’t dying.</p><p>“We just killed your brother, by the way,” McClane was saying. “He was in that pickup when it went blooey.” A grin, utterly inhuman, spread over his face. “Payback for what he did to my partner.”</p><p>“Sent him back to Hell?” Dean said. “Good. But you’re lying about Sam being dead.”</p><p>“What makes you say that?”</p><p>“You worked too hard for this. And Sam’s too important to you.”</p><p>The demon paused, as if for reflection, and did an odd thing—he nodded.</p><p>“You’re right,” McClane said. “He is.”</p><p>“So what’s this all about? With you and your ‘kin?’”</p><p>McClane waved the question away as if it didn’t concern him.</p><p>“Wheels within wheels. It’s all too sophisticated for the likes of you.”</p><p>“You know,” Dean said, “I think I liked you better when you were just a redneck.”</p><p>“Ah,” the demon beamed—but was there a flicker of impatience behind that placidity, a flame of anger buried deep in the demon’s enamel of bemused calm? Dean thought so. Seeing it there gave him a dose of vicious satisfaction.</p><p>“In any case, we’re past all that now aren’t we?” McClane tilted his whiskered chin toward the shredded skin of Dean’s right chest wall. “How’s the shoulder, by the way?”</p><p>“Hurts like hell.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>Dean ignored him. He was looking beyond the demon now, at the police cars with their strobes flickering over the parking lot, where no less than Sheriff Jackie Daniels herself was striding toward the battlefield, radio in hand, leading a phalanx of State Troopers. There was another crashing BOOM as the sky exploded again, and they all stopped in their tracks.</p><p>Fixing his eyes back on McClane, Dean stood up straight.</p><p>“So what’s the plan?”</p><p>McClane cocked an eyebrow.</p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>“You kill me and my brother, then your demon army takes over the town and throws a big party. Fly the Confederate flag, play war heroes. Am I missing anything?”</p><p>“No,” McClane said. “I think you’ve unfolded it all very nicely.”</p><p>“What happens when Judas catches up with you?”</p><p>“It’ll be too late.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. “You’re right about that.”</p><p>McClane cocked his head.</p><p>“You agree with me?”</p><p>“Absolutely.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Dean shook his head.</p><p>“Because me and Honest Abe here are gonna kick your Rebel ass.”</p><p>Something snapped in the demon’s composure. He charged Dean in a single blurring step, flying at him, knocking him flat again. Dean tasted the familiar now sulfuric tang of asphalt.</p><p>Hello, asphalt.</p><p>McClane stepped over him and swung back his foot, kicking him in the shoulder.</p><p>Right in the gunshot wound.</p><p>The pain was unholy. Nerve bundles shrieked inside him. Dean screamed. He couldn’t help it. McClane kicked him again.</p><p>The demon was talking between kicks. Spitting out words in bursts, between swings of his boot.</p><p>“When I tortured Winston to death—“</p><p>Kick.</p><p>“I thought it couldn’t get any more fun than that.”</p><p>Kick.</p><p>“But this—“</p><p>Kick.</p><p>“Makes that—“</p><p>Kick.</p><p>“Feel like a dryhump in the backseat of old granddad’s Studebaker.”</p><p>Dean squirmed at McClane’s feet. The tips of the demon’s Red Wing boots were dripping with his blood. A glob of it dangled from one of the half-tied laces. He tried to scream again but couldn’t. His entire right side had gone numb, and that included his face. Being numb, however, somehow didn’t stop it from feeling as if it were on fire.</p><p>McClane towered over him, triumphant. Dean could see him drawing back his leg, preparing one last kick, the blow that would either knock him unconscious or snap his spinal cord.</p><p>“Goodbye, Dean.”</p><p>The boot arced forward again. This time, somehow, Dean managed to reach up with his good arm and seize hold of it, clutching onto it for dear life. The move was so sudden, so unexpected, that it actually caught McClane off-balance, and when Dean jerked him forward, the demon went sprawling with a half-audible grunt of surprise.</p><p>Straddling him, Dean grabbed McClane by the hair and rammed his face down into the pavement. Something splintered; something popped. Facial bones. Cartilage. Teeth.</p><p>Remember, an inner voice cut in, this is just a meat-suit, there once was a person in there—</p><p>At the moment Dean didn’t care. He struck the McClane-demon again, hard and fast, while he still had the momentum. Capsules of adrenaline were erupting in his motor cortex, bursting open like strings of firecrackers, popping hot wires of energy through the muscles of his good arm.</p><p>Beneath him, McClane let out a muffled howl and spat a mouthful of pebbles and debris, and it was like music to Dean’s ears. All at once he felt as if he could do this all night if he had to.</p><p>“You worthless piece of trash,” McClane said. “Look what you did to my face.”</p><p>The demon pitched over to one side, throwing Dean down, and locked both hands around his throat. Dean looked up at McClane. His face was a cratered, oozing ruin. McClane’s grip pinched off Dean’s trachea, and he couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Blackness started sliding down on top of him in a massive avalanche.</p><p>Then, screaming.</p><p>But this time it wasn’t him.</p><p>McClane was screaming.</p><p>The hands around Dean’s throat loosened and fell slack. The bloody oval of the demon’s mouth was wide open and he was howling bloody murder. Behind him, Sheriff Jackie Daniels was standing over his shoulder, reaching down, doing something to the back of his neck. From this angle, Dean couldn’t quite see what it was... and when he did see, it didn’t make sense.</p><p>The sheriff was holding the inside of her wrist against McClane’s neck. Not hitting him, not even grabbing him, barely even touching him. But it was enough to make McClane collapse, cringing, onto his belly, where he cowered and whimpered and tried to pull away but couldn’t. Daniels hunkered down next to him, pressing her wrist directly against his flesh.</p><p>She wasn’t looking at Dean. Didn’t even seem to notice he was there. Every ounce of her attention was focused on Tommy McClane.</p><p>“Struggle all you want,” she said. “As long as this tattoo’s on you, you’re not leaving this meat-suit. So tell me what I want to know.” She leaned further down, until her face was right next to his head. And although her voice wasn’t loud, Dean could hear, very clearly, the words she spoke in McClane’s ear.</p><p>“Where’s the noose?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-29">CHAPTER 29</span><a href="#chapter-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Sam came to, he was being dragged backward by his arms across the burning battleground. One of his boots had come off and his ankle was swollen to the size of a grapefruit. Migraine-sized throbs of pain rocked his vision, sloshing his thoughts from side to side.</p><p>Groaning silently, Sam looked behind him. The two men pulling him were also re-enactors, one Union, one Confederate. The Rebel was shouting into a cell phone. The Yankee had a first aid kit.</p><p>All around him, the world blazed. Men in Civil War uniforms were running wildly, erratically, in every direction. More uniformed figures—McClane’s demonic kin—were screaming down the hillside, weapons held up and ready. It was impossible to say how many of them were out there, although he thought there might be a hundred, maybe more. They seemed to be spilling out of a wound in time, boiling out of some dusty epoch whose daily life was as remote as the pages of history itself. Yet they were real enough.</p><p>As Sam watched, one of the demons ran up to a re-enactor in a blue Union uniform and plunged his bayonet into the man’s throat, then yanked it out with a howl of triumph and thrust the blade, still dripping, high into the air. The first rays of morning sunlight kissed the gleaming tip and shot back a sunburst of scarlet brilliance.</p><p>Sam’s head reeled.</p><p>Then he remembered the pickup truck.</p><p>And Sarah Rafferty.</p><p>The truck he could see from here, fifty yards away, a burning heap of twisted metal that had crashed at the edge of the creek. Flames from the cab had spread to engulf the stand of cypress trees, and although it was probably just the reflection of the flames, it looked like the creek itself had caught fire.</p><p>But what about Sarah?</p><p>And Dean?</p><p>Sam had fallen out of the driver’s seat when the mortar round had launched it into the air. Thinking back, he recalled how much it had hurt when he’d hit the dirt, with just enough consciousness left to look up and see Tommy McClane’s Ranger spinning in the air over his head, its twisted front-end grinning down from the peak of its arc, just before gravity snagged it and flung it back down.</p><p>He had glanced over, seen Sarah’s face as she’d stuck her head up and realized what was falling toward her —</p><p>After that: blackout.</p><p>Yanking Sam’s arms, the two re-enactors dragged him into a tent and dropped him unceremoniously next to several other men who were already sprawled on the ground, motionless, bleeding through their uniforms.</p><p>“Can you hear me, buddy?”</p><p>Sam raised his head.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“You all right? Anything broken?”</p><p>“I don’t think so.” He looked around. The tent smelled like scorched wool and had the coppery stink of freshly spilled blood. There was the sickeningly sweet smell of cauterized flesh, too. The man lying to his immediate right had had all his hair burned away, leaving his scalp a boiled globe of fresh scars and blisters. One of his ears was almost burned off. He was weeping and throwing up at the same time, trying to breathe and calling out to someone named Megan.</p><p>“This thing doesn’t work for crap,” the Rebel re-enactor said, finally tossing the cell phone down in disgust. “Can you see the parking lot?”</p><p>“They’ve got it blocked off.”</p><p>“Sheriff’s out there somewhere,” the Yank said. “I saw her car. Plus the Staties.”</p><p>“What about ambulances?”</p><p>“They—“</p><p>A blast of musketfire tore through the tent wall, opening a hole the size of a dinner plate in the fabric. Through it, Sam saw the grinning faces of demons in blue and gray approaching from fifty yards away. From what he could see, they had formed a barricade around the encampment, blocking off the parking lot and encircling the remaining tents on all sides.</p><p>“They’re closing in,” the Rebel said. “Who are these guys?”</p><p>The Yankee didn’t look back.</p><p>“Their eyes are all black,” he said. “And the weapons they’re using are replicas. How is that even possible?”</p><p>“Long story.” For an instant Sam considered trying to clarify, then decided against it. “We’ve got to get out of here.”</p><p>“There’s no other place. Those things have the parking lot blocked off. We’re surrounded.”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter—we can’t stay here.” Levering himself up, Sam counted the other men in the tent and came up with eleven. “Who else is out there on the battlefield?”</p><p>The Confederate shrugged, a jerky, panicky move, like a hostage under interrogation, and when his Adam’s apple jerked up and down, Sam realized that he’d met the man before.</p><p>“You’re...” He hesitated, grasping for the name. “Ashcroft, right?”</p><p>“Ashgrove.”</p><p>“You’re part of the 32^nd^. I talked to you before.” Sam cast his eyes back out through the hole in the tent. “Is there anybody else left alive out there?”</p><p>“Not many,” Ashgrove admitted. “Most of them took off for town before they sealed off the camp, or...” His voice broke off, and he looked abruptly as if he were going to burst into tears. “My God. What’s happening?”</p><p>“We have to get these wounded men to safety,” Sam said. “Now.” He found a boot that would replace the one he had lost, and pulled it on. He had a feeling its owner wasn’t around any longer to miss it.</p><p>Ashgrove shook his head.</p><p>“We’re staying here.”</p><p>“In a tent?”</p><p>“It’s shelter. Maybe if we leave ‘em alone, those things will pass us by.”</p><p>Sam flicked his eyes back. He saw a pile of canvas stretchers, the old-fashioned kind with wooden poles on either side.</p><p>“If we stack the wounded by twos, we can get them out of here while there’s still a chance. Otherwise...” He swallowed, tasting something sour in his throat and belly, “we’re all going to die.”</p><p>The Union boy looked Sam straight in the eye. He looked tired and frightened but, like Ashgrove, determined to deal with the practicalities of survival.</p><p>“Say we can get out,” he said, “Ash is right. We’re surrounded. Where are we going to go?”</p><p>Sam opened his mouth and realized he didn’t have an answer.</p><p>“I know a place.”</p><p>The three of them looked over at the entrance of the tent. Standing there, clutching the canvas flap in one hand, was Sarah Rafferty. Her face was strained, and the bruises under her eyes made her look like the victim of a particularly inept undertaker, but it was definitely Sarah, upright and breathing. Sam felt a small gust of relief, a sense that something might actually go right this early-morning.</p><p>“Sarah,” he said, “are you...?”</p><p>“I’m alive.”</p><p>“Sarah?” Ashgrove asked, staring at her. “Wait, Tanner—? You’re a girl?”</p><p>Sarah waved him off.</p><p>“There’s a place we can get to,” she said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-30">CHAPTER 30</span><a href="#chapter-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Judas Iscariot strolled along the hillside.</p><p>He’d considered making his entrance on a pale horse, but that seemed too pretentious, even for him. Simply appearing here tempted fate in a way that wasn’t entirely comfortable with. Time and experience had made him circumspect.</p><p>But in the end he’d donned a general’s uniform, strapped on a cutlass and strode out from the copse of live oak along the battlefield’s southernmost perimeter to watch the action unfold from above. Not because he intended to alter the flow of events—such things were better left to others—but simply to observe the endlessly amusing spectacle of human suffering.</p><p>Like crucifixions and pornography, it never got old.</p><p>He’d arrived before dawn, already hearing the sound of cannons and the cries of demonic jubilation down below. It didn’t do much to lighten his mood. News of what had happened to his Collector in the basement of the Pentecostal Church had, of course, already reached him and left him feeling sour, plunging him into the restlessness and depression that had plagued him on and off for the last two thousand years.</p><p>He’d always been the moodiest of the Twelve, and becoming a demon hadn’t changed that.</p><p>And then there was the loss of a noose.</p><p>There were other nooses, of course, a half-dozen of them, scattered throughout the world from Bangkok to Burbank, most in the hands of private collectors or occultists with no real sense of what they had. And there would be more, as humanity in its endless resourcefulness decoded the secret of the seventh knot and wove their fates like the obedient little sheep they were.</p><p>But now there was one less.</p><p>And losing a noose and a Collector in one night—to a minor demon like McClane—was an aggravation to Iscariot. At least the battle that the idiot had unleashed here would—</p><p>“Judas?”</p><p>He stopped, brought up short by the unexpected sound of his name spoken aloud. He turned to look at the man standing a few yards away, wearing a rumpled suit and trench coat, looking as if he too had been up half the night. Recognizing him at last, Judas smiled.</p><p>“Castiel,” he said, with genuine pleasure. “How are you, my friend?”</p><p>Castiel stared at him.</p><p>“I’ve been looking everywhere for you.”</p><p>Judas turned his attention again to the battle below.</p><p>“Always a treat to watch the ants swarm the anthill, isn’t it?” When Castiel didn’t respond, Judas turned and scowled a little. “Surely you don’t hold me accountable for this.”</p><p>“It was your noose.”</p><p>“Stolen from me!” Judas protested, more petulant than angry. “McClane and his minions ambushed one of my Collectors and took it from him. Worse, he had your friends do it for him.”</p><p>“Yet it was your noose, so it becomes your responsibility.”</p><p>Judas shook his head, holding up both hands.</p><p>“I didn’t survive as long as I have by getting involved in every petty skirmish that comes along.”</p><p>“This isn’t just another petty skirmish,” Castiel said. “With everything that’s been happening, you must know what’s at stake.”</p><p>“Again, it’s not my problem.”</p><p>“You’re not worried?”</p><p>Judas frowned at him.</p><p>“Of course I am. You know me. I always worry.” He paused to watch a squadron of demons on horseback set fire to a tent. Several human re-enactors came scurrying out and the demons shot them in the back with muskets. He could hear their laughter, brittle and barbed. “But honestly, when you look at the grand tapestry, what’s to be done?” Then he turned again.</p><p>“Why are you here?” Realization, of a sort, began to sink into Judas’s face. “What is it you want from me, Castiel?”</p><p>“It’s not like that.”</p><p>“Don’t try to be tactful. It was never your gift.”</p><p>Castiel sighed.</p><p>“I’m looking for Him.”</p><p>“Still?”</p><p>“Still.”</p><p>“I don’t see why—“ Judas broke off. “Wait. You don’t think... that I...?” He gaped at Castiel, eyes agog, mouth slightly open. The sense of incredulity swelled into full-blown disbelief, straining all color from his cheeks. For a moment he felt as if he was going to explode with anger.</p><p>Instead he burst out laughing.</p><p>“Oh. Oh my.” The laughter doubled him over, and he held his stomach, roaring until tears sparkled in his eyes. “Oh, my dear Castiel, I’m sorry, I... I saw you here and I just assumed that you were... but you... Oh my—“</p><p>And he was off again on a flight of giggles.</p><p>“You should see the look on your face. Priceless.” When he finally caught his breath, he clapped Castiel on the shoulder. “Thank you,” wiping his eyes, sniffling, “I needed that. I honestly did.”</p><p>Castiel stood stiffly, unmoved.</p><p>“Did you not break bread with His son?”</p><p>“Oh, yes,” Judas said, gazing skyward, apparently lost in reverie. “Yes indeed. We broke bread and I knelt at his feet. And we talked of many things.” His head snapped around, voice sharp, eyes hard and black. There wasn’t a trace of laughter remaining in his face. “But I serve a different master now.”</p><p>Castiel took a step back, cringing away.</p><p>“Sorry. Painful memory.” Judas stepped forward and reached out to brush an imaginary bit of lint from Castiel’s shoulder. “Go. Go down. Be among your people.”</p><p>Your people.</p><p>Castiel turned to look reluctantly back down the hill at the ruined battlefield, thick with smoke. What he saw there was Hieronymus Bosch by way of Ken Burns. Demons on horseback and on foot had surrounded the last of the re-enactors’ tents and were spreading across the parking lot. They had fallen on the police cars and were smashing their windows, rocking the vehicles back and forth, setting fire to them.</p><p>A dozen additional state police cruisers arrived, and troopers began firing back at the attackers from behind their vehicles. One of the demons jumped his horse over a police car, swinging his saber down in a wild Pete Townshend-style swoop to lop the arm off the trooper below him. The horse’s hooves smashed the cruiser’s roof-lights, throwing showers of sparks across the pavement. Below him, the maimed trooper stood gaping at the jetting stump where his arm had once been.</p><p>“I came to speak to you,” Castiel said.</p><p>Judas affected a tone of sympathy.</p><p>“Then I’m sorry for your wasted trip.”</p><p>“It’s not wasted if I can help,” Castiel said, “and I will. But first I have to know if you’ve told me everything you can. You must tell me what you know.”</p><p>“I know this is difficult to hear,” Judas said, “but knowing what I do know about Him, I can honestly say that you should be grateful for your ignorance. It truly is bliss.”</p><p>Castiel looked at him. It was impossible to tell whether the demon was joking or not. Whatever the case, Judas was right. And he needed to get down there, and now, while there was still something left to save.</p><p>“Castiel?” Judas called out behind him as he resumed his patrol. “It was good to catch up. Don’t be a stranger.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-31">CHAPTER 31</span><a href="#chapter-31" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean wasn’t exactly sure when they started losing the battle, or if they’d ever been winning. But when he saw the first wave of demons in uniforms spilling over the parking lot, picking off cops and re-enactors with lethal accuracy, he realized that the outcome was no longer even in doubt.</p><p>In front of him, still on the pavement, McClane was laughing.</p><p>“You like that?” Sheriff Daniels asked the demon, staring straight down into its ruined face. “You want some more, you soulless prick?”</p><p>McClane couldn’t speak, but just lay cackling with a big hysterical-looking grin twisting up the corners of his bloody, ruined mouth. Most of his teeth were gone, and those that remained stuck up every which way like tombstones in tornado country. His bright, black eyes were flashing everywhere at once... everywhere, that was, except for at Sheriff Daniels, who leaned over him again, holding up the inside of her wrist, this time toward his face.</p><p>Dean looked at the Santeria tattoo on the Sheriff’s wrist, the loop of numbers with the smaller circle within it. It wasn’t exactly glowing, but there was a peculiar luminescence to it, as if the lines themselves were heating up from inside. It reminded him of the glowing dial on one of those old-time radium wristwatches, the kind that was rumored to give you cancer.</p><p>“Hey, Sheriff, what—?” Dean started.</p><p>“Quiet,” the sheriff snapped, never taking her attention away from McClane. “I’m going to ask you one more time. Where’s the noose?”</p><p>McClane grinned harder, the remains of his teeth gnashing together. Tendons bulged in his jaw.</p><p>“I cut it up. Chopped it to pieces. Cast it to the four winds.”</p><p>“You’re lying.” Bending down, she peeled back McClane’s left eyelid so that the black sclera was completely exposed. “Hold him,” she said to Dean. “Pin him down.”</p><p>“What?” Dean said. “So now we’re BFFs?”</p><p>“If your definition of a friend is someone who’s saving your ass,” Daniels said, “then yes. I still don’t understand who the hell you are, but right now I’m your only hope.”</p><p>“And dozens of other golden hits,” Dean retorted. “Sorry, Sheriff. I’ll take my chances.”</p><p>“You don’t have to trust me. Just do as I say. I’ll explain later. All right?”</p><p>“Do as you say? That’s your pitch?” Dean stared at her in disbelief. “Screw you, lady.”</p><p>He crawled away, moving slowly, but definitely moving.</p><p>The ground was littered with broken glass, fallen branches and debris. He bumped into something and, before he knew what was happening, felt a hand taking him by the arm, lifting him gently but firmly back to his feet. He wobbled a little, but felt steadier when he saw who had helped him up.</p><p>“Cass,” Dean said. “Nice of you to get in the game.”</p><p>Castiel nodded.</p><p>“I found this for you,” he said, and Dean saw that he was holding the demon-killing knife.</p><p>Dean took the blade. Its familiar shape and heft felt good in his hand. He looked back to where the sheriff was still struggling to hold McClane down and felt the angel’s hand on his shoulder.</p><p>“She’s right, Dean.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Sheriff Daniels. She and her family bear a sacred trust— they have been guardians of the noose for generations.”</p><p>“Look, Cass, I know you’re probably still a little creased about Sam capping your Witness and all, but...”</p><p>“That doesn’t matter now.” Castiel’s grip on Dean’s shoulder tightened considerably, almost painfully. “My priorities have changed.”</p><p>Then the angel disappeared abruptly.</p><p>Sighing, Dean tucked the blade into his belt and started back toward McClane and the sheriff. She glanced up at him in surprise.</p><p>“Changed your mind?”</p><p>“I don’t wanna talk about it.” Squatting down, he used his good arm to hold McClane’s upper torso and shoulders flat against the asphalt. In front of him, close enough that he could smell her shampoo, Sheriff Daniels leaned directly over McClane’s wide-open eye. Then she flexed her hand back and pressed the tattoo directly against his eyeball. Dean heard a faint hissing sound, like a red-hot brand burning into skin, and McClane shrieked and thrashed.</p><p>“Where is it?” Daniels asked, shouting above his screams. “Where’s the seventh coil?”</p><p>She held her wrist there for another moment, then drew it away. Underneath her, McClane gasped and fumed. When he looked up at them, Dean saw the faint imprint of her tattoo burned over the glassy black eightball of his left eye. It looked like a tiny, complicated blueprint. Reddish-black tears trickled from the corners.</p><p>“...lost it...” he managed. “...dropped it somewhere...” He manufactured another grin and somehow managed a weak, watery laugh. “Doesn’t matter... you’ve already lost... stupid bitch...” He sucked in his cheeks, and made a horking noise deep in his throat.</p><p>“Look out,” Dean said, “I think he’s gonna—“</p><p>The demon spat a thick gobbet of blood directly in the sheriff’s face. She didn’t even flinch, just reached up and wiped the spittle from her cheek. Throughout it all, her expression didn’t change. When she spoke again her voice was as cold as ice.</p><p>“That’s it,” she said. “I’m going to burn your eyes right out of your head.”</p><p>From nearby came a loud nickering scream, a clatter of hooves on metal, and Dean looked up to see two black-eyed Confederate demons on horseback riding hard across the roofs of parked police cars. One was carrying a flaming Confederate flag. Upon seeing Dean and the sheriff, the soldier drew back his arm and threw it, the pole whistling through the air like a javelin in the direction of Sheriff Daniels.</p><p>Dean sprang upward and grabbed Daniels, knocking her backward just as the pole slammed into the asphalt where she’d been less than a second earlier.</p><p>Daniels gazed up at him, startled and badly shaken. The demon’s blood was still streaked along the side of her nose.</p><p>“Idiot.”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Dean said.</p><p>The sheriff pointed at the bloodstain where McClane had been lying.</p><p>“He’s gone.”</p><p>“You still owe me a big explanation.”</p><p>Daniels seethed.</p><p>“So do you. Get off me!”</p><p>Another clatter of hooves filled the air, and they both looked around to see the next wave of demons surging across the parking lot.</p><p>“There’s no time,” Dean said, hauling himself to his feet. He glanced at the cruiser nearest them. Its roof was partially smashed in, the lights and windshield demolished, but the loudspeakers on either side still looked operational.</p><p>He started toward the car, opened the door and got in the driver’s seat.</p><p>“Wait,” Daniels said. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I’ve got an idea.”</p><p>“You can’t leave.”</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Dean said. “But my left arm is shot. You’re gonna have to help me steer.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-32">CHAPTER 32</span><a href="#chapter-32" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Six-fifteen a.m.</p><p>While the rest of the Eastern seaboard was just waking up, pouring its first cup of coffee, switching on the news and getting the first online updates of what would soon be called the strangest attack in recent history, other events were beginning to unfold.</p><p>Less than two hours had passed since Tommy McClane had cut the noose open, unleashing his armies of the night upon the town of Mission’s Ridge. But in this age of modern marvels, with the country’s threat level parked semipermanently on orange, two hours was plenty of time.</p><p>Word had gone out.</p><p>Alarms had sounded. Officials had been shaken from their beds and briefed. And certain federal agencies had responded with the appropriate degree of vigor and enthusiasm.</p><p>Since 9/11, the federal Department of Homeland Security had authorized the existence of several regional top-secret domestic taskforces—standing armies with state-of-the-art weapons and ground and air support. Unlike the National Guard, these soldiers trained for the single eventuality of a fullblown terrorist attack on U.S. soil. When the map turned red over Mission’s Ridge, Georgia, that morning at six a.m., they were on the ground and mobilized immediately.</p><p>Sam and Sarah were running across the battlefield as fast as they could, with a stretcher pole in each hand, when the first black helicopter buzzed overhead. Sam paid it no attention. At the moment he was far too busy to care.</p><p>The height discrepancy between him and Sarah made carrying the stretcher difficult enough; the weight made it nearly impossible. Balanced on the stretcher were two of the wounded re-enactors from the tent, one of whom didn’t look as though he’d survive the trip. Ashgrove and the other re-enactor, a young man named Bendis, were running behind them, carrying two more on their stretcher.</p><p>The rest, they were going to have to come back for—if they even got that chance.</p><p>“This way!” Sarah shouted. “Watch out for the rails!” Crab-walking, she and Sam scrambled over the railroad tracks, stepping over heavy wooden cross-ties, behind the steam engine, the coal car and flatcar of the old nineteenth-century train. Beyond it, the railway shed stood along the western edge of the thick second-growth forest that marked the outer perimeter of the battlefield.</p><p>The helicopter circled back over the woods, completing a circuit of the perimeter.</p><p>Backing up to the railway shed, Sam swung his foot and kicked the heavy wooden door wide open, then he and Sarah ducked inside. The shadows smelled like coal and oil and ancient iron.</p><p>“The roof’s re-enforced steel,” Sarah said. “The C.S.A. did it to protect their trains. I thought we might be safer in here.”</p><p>“Good.” Sam nodded, wincing as they put the stretcher down.</p><p>“Are you all right?” she asked.</p><p>“My ankle... I’ll be okay.”</p><p>Ashgrove and Bendis were already coming through the doorway with their wounded, laying the stretcher down as gently as possible.</p><p>“What about the others?” Bendis asked.</p><p>“I can try to go back,” Sam said, and overhead he heard the low-flying helicopter making another pass, the roar of its rotors temporarily blotting out everything else.</p><p>“Did you guys see that thing?” Bendis asked. “Who was that?”</p><p>“Whoever it is,” Sarah said, “they’re not here to help us.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s FEMA,” Ashgrove said.</p><p>Bendis shot him a look.</p><p>“Bite your tongue.”</p><p>“Come on, man.” Ashgrove shook his head. “It could be medevac. If we can get up on the roof—“</p><p>A thunderous explosion shook the railway shed, rattling the walls like the inside of a steel drum, dropping a thin rain of dust and debris from the rafters. Sam dropped into a defensive crouch. When the aftershock passed, he made his way back over to the doorway and looked across the battlefield, still crouching low.</p><p>His heart sank.</p><p>“It’s too late.”</p><p>Sarah joined him and gazed across the battlefield. The tent that they’d left behind just minutes before was in flames. The last four re-enactors had never made it out, and now they never would. The demons that had set fire to it were riding horses around the blaze, firing into it at random.</p><p>Overhead, the chopper roared by again.</p><p>Standing up, Sam took a brief inventory of their new surroundings. The railroad shed was perhaps two hundred feet by thirty. Like the town’s Historical Society, it had been refurbished with small exhibits illustrating the battle that had taken place. Display cases containing railway tools, newspapers, and other relics adorned the walls.</p><p>On the floor in front of him, Bendis and Ashgrove hunched over the wounded, performing triage to gauge the severity of their casualties.</p><p>“Man,” Bendis said, “this is worse than Fallujah.”</p><p>Sarah glanced at him.</p><p>“You were there?”</p><p>“Two tours. That’s where I met this douchebag.” He glanced over at Ashgrove. “Eighteen months and not a scratch. Then last year he calls me up and asks if I want to have some fun over the weekend.” Bendis shook his head sourly. “Some fun.”</p><p>Ashgrove gave him a cold look.</p><p>“You saying you want to quit, Marine?”</p><p>Bendis stood up. His cheeks were flushed.</p><p>“Negative. Whatever’s out there, whatever the hell it is, is trying to take us out. Two of those guys that died out there are men that you and I served with.”</p><p>“Good,” Ashgrove said. “I was starting to worry about you for a second.”</p><p>Either these guys are really brave, Sam thought to himself, or really stupid. Then he joined them in tending to the wounded.</p><p>Another explosion rocked the earth. The railway shed shivered around them. More rust-colored debris sifted down.</p><p>Sam bent down over one of the wounded men. The re-enactor’s leg had been almost completely severed just below the knee, and was hanging by the barest shreds of integument, and Sam’s hands were gloved in blood. He lifted the red-soaked rags from the leg, tossing them aside in a sloppy, dripping pile.</p><p>“Hey!” he suddenly shouted.</p><p>“What is it?” Sarah asked.</p><p>“Tourniquet.” Sam glanced at Ashgrove and Bendis. “Which one of you guys tied this on?”</p><p>“I did,” Bendis said. “What’s it matter?”</p><p>“Where did you find it?”</p><p>“Out there somewhere. It was a piece of rope and I grabbed it. His femoral artery was severed and I needed something to hold the bandage on, stop the bleeding. What’s the difference?”</p><p>Using strips of gauze to hold it, Sam studied the thick loop of rope pulled tight around the man’s leg.</p><p>It was the last coil of the noose.</p><p>Sarah leaned closer to look.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>The man sat up and grabbed her. His eyes were open and pitch black.</p><p>He grinned.</p><p>Sarah screamed.</p><h2><span id="chapter-33">CHAPTER 33</span><a href="#chapter-33" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Staggering across the battlefield, McClane heard a scream.</p><p>He was weak, blind in one eye, his meat-suit wracked with pain, but none of that mattered. The chaos he’d unleashed here was reaching its boiling point, and soon the goal would be in sight. The cannons that had been blaring from the hillside had finally fallen silent, perhaps temporarily, maybe for good. It didn’t matter. The objective was now within reach.</p><p>Sam Winchester’s true purpose would be fulfilled.</p><p>Grinning through cracked lips, McClane heard another scream—this one louder.</p><p>It came from the railway shed.</p><p>He glanced at the parking lot, saw both flanks of his demonic army riding back around to surround the police cars and military vehicles that now filled the lot.</p><p>Soldiers in camouflage were piling out of the newly-arrived personnel carriers, carrying automatic rifles, opening fire on the Confederate and Union-garbed figures. The demons charged them, cutting through their ranks, blasting and slashing with high good humor. Their antique muskets, breechloaders and carbines had become supernaturally powerful, spraying flame that enveloped whole vehicles in great, leaping gulps.</p><p>A soldier jumped out of a blazing Humvee and bolted across the parking lot. The man was on fire and screaming. As the recon helicopter blared back overhead, a cavalry demon went charging up behind the burning man and decapitated him with a swift slash of his bayonet. In one fluid movement the demon caught the severed head in midair, its face and hair burning like a Roman candle, spun around in the saddle and flung it upward at the helicopter.</p><p>The burning missile smashed into the chopper’s glass canopy, shattering it, and a moment later, the cockpit was filled with orange flame and smoke, the helicopter pitching and yawing erratically in the air. McClane paused to watch as the chopper canted hard to the left and fell out of the sky, exploding on the ground in a fireball that unleashed heat he could feel from where he stood. Good times.</p><p>He raised one hand in the air.</p><p>It was as if a silent alarm had sounded across the battlefield. The cavalry and infantry demons stopped what they were doing, swinging around to face him.</p><p>Hundreds of attentive black-eyed faces looked directly at him, shoulders at attention, awaiting orders.</p><p>McClane pointed at the shed.</p><h2><span id="chapter-34">CHAPTER 34</span><a href="#chapter-34" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam landed on the demon full-force, with the idea that sheer momentum might be enough. Obligingly, it let go of Sarah’s neck. Only to turn its attention to Sam. Instantly it was on him, and it was out for blood.</p><p>He had no plan and no means of self-defense.</p><p>The demon pinned Sam to the floor. The sulfurous stink was overwhelming. It grabbed one of the bloody rags that had served as its tourniquet, jerked Sam’s mouth open and tried to cram the rag inside.</p><p>Sam choked, his gag-reflex triggering over and over, and managed to get his mouth shut. Even so, he could smell the blood. But not just any blood. It was heavy, almost intoxicatingly potent and somehow rotten at the same time—demon blood. The re-enactor had continued seeping into his bandages long after the noose had turned him.</p><p>He tried to turn his head, to keep his mouth shut, but the demon had fastened its hand over his lower jaw and kept trying to pry it open.</p><p>In the background, a million miles away, something was happening. Ashgrove and Bendis were scuffling to get the attacker off of him. The demon shrugged them away, batting them off like insects.</p><p>Sam couldn’t see much. The room was fading fast around him, sinking away in gradations of gray.</p><p>“Leave him alone,” a voice said.</p><p>The demon jerked upright, his weight rising off Sam’s chest. As his vision cleared, he saw Castiel had yanked his assailant away from him and was holding the demon by the throat, both hands clenching while the demon made gargling sounds.</p><p>“Cass,” Sam choaked. “I thought—“</p><p>The door of the railroad shed blew off its hinges, flying inward, smashing the demon backward and flinging it across the room like some unwanted toy.</p><p>Castiel vanished.</p><p>In the middle of it all, Sam felt a random verse from Scripture race through his mind: And the stone the builder rejected will become the cornerstone. Where did these thoughts come from, he wondered dazedly, and why did they arrive in his mind when they did?</p><p>The door was followed by the rest of the wall, the wood and reinforced steel of the shed itself blasting inward on a geyser of flame as wide as a semi. That gout of fire sucked the oxygen out of the building. The ceiling pulled downward in a crumpling shriek of splintering oak and tortured steel. It was like being trapped inside an enormous tin can as it was being crushed.</p><p>The roof’s coming down, Sam thought, And it—</p><p>The noise stopped. The last row of crossbeams held steady.</p><p>Sam stared up at the steel plating, partially caved in five meters above their heads.</p><p>Forcing himself up, he spat the bloody rag from his mouth. He jabbed one finger down his throat, felt his stomach tighten and squeeze, and expelled a thick spew of bloody liquid, spitting it out onto the ground.</p><p>Did I get it out?</p><p>I think so. I hope so. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.</p><p>Through the smoke, he saw Tommy McClane walking through the fire. McClane’s face was a mad Expressionist painting of bruises and insults. One black eye flickered with an imprinted sigil that seemed to have been burned directly onto his optic membrane. He was flanked by more demons than Sam could count, all of them armed with sabers, muskets, and bayonets, and when the back wall of the railway shed began to crumple and collapse, Sam saw that they had encircled it on all sides.</p><p>“We’ve been waiting a long time for this,” McClane said. “I think you’re ready now.”</p><p>“What do you...?”</p><p>“Your true nature. I’m aware that it requires a certain amount of carnage and a heightened degree of desperation to bring it forth.” McClane’s one working eye rolled upward, weirdly detached from the other. He nodded over at the demon that had shoved its bandages into Sam’s mouth. “He was trying to do it himself, but he didn’t really know what he was doing. And besides, I had to see it with my own... well, eyes.”</p><p>“What?” Sam asked. “What are you talking about?”</p><p>“You. You’re his vessel. Say yes. Bring him forth.”</p><p>“Lucifer?”</p><p>McClane nodded.</p><p>“That’s what this is all about?”</p><p>“You will be the Light-bringer, Sam.” Suddenly McClane was standing directly in front of him, bare inches away. Within breathing distance. It had happened so fast, in a parody of motion, that Sam didn’t even see him move.</p><p>“Certainly you’re aware of the Gnostic gospel. If you bring forth what is inside you, what you bring forth will save you. If you don’t bring forth what’s inside of you, what you don’t bring forth will destroy you.” He smiled, almost gently now. “So I present you with the choice. Manifest your true self for me now, or be destroyed.”</p><p>“You make it sound so tempting.”</p><p>“Tempting or not,” McClane said, “it’s the best offer you’re going to get, and it’s not going to get that good again.”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Then I guess you’d better kill me.”</p><p>McClane just looked at him, a faint smile still riding the corners of his lips. He didn’t even appear to be upset. If anything, he seemed satisfied.</p><p>“First things first.” Gesturing at one of the cavalry demons to his left, he said, “Kill the girl.”</p><p>“Wait,” Sam started. “She’s not—“</p><p>The demon’s arm snapped forward, grabbing Sarah Rafferty by the hair and jerking her toward him, the edge of his bayonet resting against her throat. Sam could see the throb of her pulse just beneath her skin, reflected in the mirror-brightness of the blade.</p><p>“Care to try again?” McClane asked. “No?” Then, to the bayonet-wielding demon. “Go ahead. Take your time.”</p><p>The blade bit in to Sarah’s neck. Sam saw her mouth leap open in a startled dark oval of pain.</p><p>But the noise he heard this time wasn’t a scream.</p><p>It was his brother’s voice.</p><h2><span id="chapter-35">CHAPTER 35</span><a href="#chapter-35" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Deus, et Peter Domini nostri Jesu Christi, invoco nomen sanctum...”</p><p>The state police cruiser hit a bump, and through the shooting pain Dean gripped the microphone harder, holding it to his lips. He could hear his own voice broadcast through the loudspeaker on top of the cruiser. The volume was turned up as loud as it could go, crackling out where the whole world could hear it.</p><p>“et clementiam tuam supplex exposco: ut adversus hunc...”</p><p>“Is it working?” Daniels shouted.</p><p>Without pausing to answer, Dean pointed out at the partially collapsed railroad shed that lay straight in front of them, sixty yards away. The sheriff gunned the accelerator, tearing up clumps of scorched battlefield dirt, swerving to the right and then bringing them back on course.</p><p>The demons surrounding the railroad shed were already recoiling, falling off their horses, collapsing to the ground in waves. They threw back their heads, wafts of thick vapor spewing out of mouths, wrenching their bodies into convulsions as they departed, swirling upward. The atmosphere around the shed was beginning to stain with a thick and sooty patina of airborne grime, like the polluted sky of a Midwestern factory town.</p><p>“Keep going,” Daniels said. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Dean didn’t stop.</p><p>“et omnem immundum spiritum, qui vexat hoc plasma tuum...”</p><p>The Rituale Romanum spilled from his lips automatically, without requiring conscious thought. Seeing the bastards go down like this always got him jazzed, triggering each line of Latin so that there was no hesitation, no interruption.</p><p>The cruiser swung up in front of the shed, stopping just short of running over the bodies that now lay strewn over the grass in the entryway.</p><p>“Over there!” Sheriff Daniels said. “Look!”</p><p>Dean snapped his head to the side and saw what she was talking about. Some of the demons—whole detachments of them, it looked like—were covering their ears, running and escaping into the woods. So he kept going.</p><p>“mihi auxilium praestare digneris. Per eumdem Dominum”</p><p>The Rituale overtook some of them before they could get out of hearing distance, but others vanished into the trees.</p><p>In the meantime, something else was happening.</p><p>Some of the Civil War re-enactors—those that hadn’t been possessed and were still trying to fight their way off the battlefield—were coming face-to-face with their demon-possessed brothers-in-arms. The result was eerily similar the confusion and chaos that typified actual battles. Dean saw one of them run up to a demon dressed as a Confederate soldier, approaching the man with both hands outstretched in a “you remember me” gesture. The demon’s response was to stab the man directly in the heart, dropping him and stepping over his bloody corpse.</p><p>Daniels slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt. Dean finished the first portion of the exorcism. He could see inside the shed now. The demons were gone, reduced to a scrum of foul-smelling murk that was eddying lazily out of the holes in the roof.</p><p>Dean jumped out of the car, wincing but not stopping. Through the thick clouds of the demon-smog, he saw Sam slouched over on the floor in what looked like a lake of blood. There was a girl slumped next to him—Sarah Rafferty, he realized. They seemed to be holding each other up. All around them, re-enactors lay bleeding in the dirt, pale and motionless like heaps of gore-stained operating room laundry. It was impossible to say which—if any—were still alive.</p><p>Or, for that matter, which ones had died fighting off the demons, and which were evacuated meat-suits that the demons had left behind.</p><p>“Sammy!” Dean made his way over. “Oh, dude...”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Sam said. “Not as bad as it looks.”</p><p>“That good, ‘cause it looks pretty freakin’ bad.”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“What about you? McClane shot you.”</p><p>“Misfire. Flesh wound.”</p><p>“Lucky break.” He stiffened a little, looked around. “Where is McClane anyway?”</p><p>“I must have smoked his ass with the Rituale,” Dean said. “Figured you heard that part.”</p><p>“No.” Sam’s expression was bleak. “McClane got out of earshot before the exorcism took hold. With a bunch of his soldiers.”</p><p>Dean’s eyes widened. “What?”</p><p>They both looked over at Sheriff Daniels. The expression on her face was a combination of disappointment and alarm.</p><p>“They’re out there, and they—“ she began, then her voice broke off. “You found it?” She said, peering past Sam.</p><p>She reached past him to the floor of the shed, grabbed a loose stretch of bandage and picked up the last uncut coil of noose from the ground. She held it at arm’s length, as if afraid to get too close to it, yet unable to put it down.</p><p>“The last loop. It’s still intact.”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“One of the men found it out there. Put it on a wounded soldier as a tourniquet.”</p><p>“Not a good choice.”</p><p>“Tell me about it,” Sam grunted.</p><p>“But...” Daniels was turning the noose over in her fingers, examining it for flaws., “it’s good for us.”</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“The seventh coil is the most powerful one in the noose. If we can get it back to its reliquary intact, lock it down in the basement of the church, we can stop the effects of the noose.”</p><p>“How do you know all this?” Sam asked.</p><p>“She’s the chosen descendant of the original guardian of the noose,” Dean parroted. “Sworn to keep it locked up in a demon-proof room.” And, off Sam’s perplexed reaction: “I talked to Cass.”</p><p>“Tommy McClane and I share a common ancestor,” Daniels said, “that much, you probably figured out. But power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. As much as I want to keep the noose locked away, McClane wanted to get it out—even before he was possessed. He coveted its magic, and it made him an appealing vessel for the lesser demons that took him over.</p><p>“I’ve returned it to the reliquary before, after finding it on Dave Wolverton’s corpse.” She fell silent a moment. “But what’s their endgame?”</p><p>“They want me to be Lucifer’s vessel,” Sam said bluntly. He let the words lie there.</p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>“It’s a long story,” Dean interjected, “and a pretty ugly one.”</p><p>He drew in a breath, bolstered by what Daniels had told them. “So all we have to do is put the last coil back in the reliquary? How easy is that?”</p><p>“Not easy at all.” The sheriff gazed out of the open side of the wrecked railway shed, across the smoking battlefield and eastward toward town. “There’s still an army of demons between us and the church, ready to do whatever it takes to stop us.”</p><p>“What about our army?” Sarah Rafferty asked. “Those soldiers out there. Can’t they help?”</p><p>“You’ve seen what those things can do,” Dean said. “What do you think?”</p><p>Real hopelessness flashed through her expression, making her look even more pale and exhausted.</p><p>“Then what...?” she began.</p><p>Sam bent down and picked up a musket.</p><p>“We bring the fight to them.”</p><p>“With what,” Dean asked, “replica guns?”</p><p>“Demon weapons kill demons, too,” Sam said. “I saw it happen, out on the battlefield, when I turned that siege cannon around on one of them.” He looked his brother squarely in the face. “And they run on blood. Demon blood.”</p><p>Dean gaped at him, unable to articulate or even identify the bolt of harsh, vivid emotion that he experienced just hearing those words from his brother.</p><p>Anger?</p><p>Distrust?</p><p>Neither of those words came close. Glancing at his brother, he saw that Sam was experiencing an even more gut-level reaction. He looked paralyzed with fear.</p><p>“That’s what Rufus told us at the beginning of all this—that the weapons ran on blood,” Dean said finally. “He didn’t say it was demon blood, though. I hate that stuff.”</p><p>“You’ve never tasted it,” Sam said evenly.</p><p>“So we find a demon,” Daniels cut in, “and we make it bleed. Where’s the problem in that?”</p><p>“You know how it is—there’s never one around when you need it,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Then Sam looked over at the pile of bloody bandages that had been held in place by the last coil of the noose—the remains of the re-enactor’s field dressing.</p><p>“I think I’ve got us covered,” he said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-36">CHAPTER 36</span><a href="#chapter-36" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The vision was coming back into McClane’s left eye.</p><p>It was different, however.</p><p>He now saw two different worlds from two different sides of his head. His right eye was normal—as “normal” as a demon’s view of the world could be, a subterranean crawlspace of predatory opportunities and constant craven impulses—but his left one had changed dramatically.</p><p>Closing his right eye and opening his left, he was greeted by an entirely new landscape, cut out in shades of reddish-orange like scalding bronze from the sculptor’s forge. He saw emotions personified in pulsing shades of blue and gray and black.</p><p>Riding into town on the back of a horse, pursued by Jeeps and military trucks, the demon that called itself Tommy McClane discovered that he liked looking at things this way—especially human beings. He had escaped the Rituale, and he’d begun to relax and regroup.</p><p>However, at the moment he was under attack from both sides. Soldiers in half-tracks and Humvees were firing on him and the remains of his demonic retinue, their bullets powerless, and McClane amused himself by squinting through his left eye, watching the auras of the humans, the actual fear in their hearts made manifest in all its glory. He wondered idly what it might taste like.</p><p>Opening both eyes now, he watched the world unfold in both directions at once. Spectral figures of his own demonic army, U.S. military personnel, and civilians all swirled together in a miasma of motion and intention. It was a peculiar kind of magic, more illusion than actual power, but a pleasant diversion, and he wished he had the luxury of enjoying it more fully.</p><p>But he a town to occupy, and to sack.</p><p>He knew, of course, that Daniels and the Winchesters would try to return the noose to the reliquary.</p><p>All he had to do was stop them.</p><p>It was almost eight a.m. when McClane’s hundred-strong demon army rode down the eight-block stretch of storefronts and buildings that constituted Main Street of Mission’s Ridge. They rode past the Dixie Buggy Wash and the Twin Kiss and the Ben Franklin Five and Dime. Some of them, like McClane, came on horseback, others on motorcycles or in stolen police cars or military vehicles still stuffed full of dead soldiers. Demons in Confederate and Union uniforms steered while others rode shotgun, firing out of the windows at the last townspeople scurrying for cover on either side of the street.</p><p>It was a turkey-shoot, pure and simple, and the demons treated it as such.</p><p>“Hey, Captain!” a soldier yelled from McClane’s left flank. “Watch this!” Drawing his saber, he flicked his wrist, sending the blade across the street where it hit a man standing in front of a Blockbuster Video, impaling him against a poster for a forthcoming Sandra Bullock romantic comedy. The man twitched and squirmed like an insect on a collector’s pin, and then fell still. Closing his right eye, McClane watched the man’s aura curdling from bright red to a listless, uninteresting charcoal gray.</p><p>McClane giggled, then snorted, then found himself braying with laughter. Setback or no setback, exorcism or no exorcism, there was absolutely no part of this that he wasn’t loving with every fiber of his being. He was a demon, and he lived for this. It was Superbowl 666, and he was the starting quarterback.</p><p>Straightening in the saddle, he slowed his horse. The First Pentecostal Church of Mission’s Ridge lay straight ahead, three blocks down. Seeing it brought new gravity to the moment. It was time for strategy.</p><p>“You men take the right side of the street.” Then McClane swung his arm toward the other flank. “You all take the opposite side. Get up in those windows. Pick your positions carefully. Minimal exposure, clear line of sight—“</p><p>“What’s the plan, Captain?”</p><p>“I’m turning this place into Dealey Plaza,” McClane said. “When those boys come through with the noose, we’re gonna go Lee Harvey Oswald on their asses.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-37">CHAPTER 37</span><a href="#chapter-37" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sarah Rafferty grabbed hold of the flatcar and pulled herself up until she was standing next to the Gatling gun mounted there on a turret. Sheriff Daniels was already positioned behind it, inspecting the gun’s hand-crank. She grabbed the lever in both hands and struggled to turn it, pushing down with all her weight, but the mechanism was frozen in place.</p><p>“You think this is going to work?” Sarah said.</p><p>“Do I think...” Leaning out of the locomotive’s cab, Dean glanced down at Sam. “Tell ‘em, Sammy.”</p><p>“Tell me what?”</p><p>“Dean loves Clint Eastwood movies,” Sam said.</p><p>Sarah stared at the Winchester brothers.</p><p>“What am I missing?”</p><p>“Ever see The Gauntlet?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No, I don’t think so.”</p><p>Dean rolled his eyes. “No appreciation for the classics. Okay, Eastwood plays a washed-up cop bringing back an ex-hooker who’s testifying against this corrupt big-city police commissioner. All he has to do is get the witness back alive. Except the commish has every cop on the force out waiting for Eastwood and they’re armed to the teeth, turning the streets of downtown Phoenix into the world’s biggest shooting gallery. So Clint shows up on the outskirts of town in a clanking old Greyhound bus that he’s tricked out with sheet metal over the windshield, and he and his witness have to run the gauntlet.”</p><p>He looked at the women expectantly. Sarah and Sheriff Daniels were both staring at him blankly.</p><p>Sarah spoke first.</p><p>“And this is supposed to make me feel better how?”</p><p>Dean started to answer with something witty and sarcastic, when he turned to take his first good look around the steam engine’s cab.</p><p>Suddenly he wasn’t so sure either.</p><p>The massive iron boiler in front of him looked as big as a house. Gauges, levers, valves and pipes sprouted out from it in every direction. A chunky thing that looked like an aluminum teapot with a brass handle stuck out by his legs. Down below, the ancient firebox hung open, cold and dead like the mouth of a giant, exhaling the long-lost coal vapors from fuel that had burned up a century before.</p><p>Come on. Get ahold of yourself, he said silently. It’s just internal combustion, right? How different can it be from the Impala?</p><p>He grabbed the big lever that ran horizontally across the cab from left to right. It had to be the throttle. Gripping in both hands, he jerked on it as hard as he could.</p><p>It didn’t budge.</p><p>“Uh, Sam?”</p><p>Sam climbed through the empty coal car into the cab with the bloody wads of bundled up bandages in his arms.</p><p>“You better hang on.”</p><p>“What? Why—“</p><p>Without bothering to answer, Sam shoved half the demon-blood stained rags through the fire door into the empty box, slammed the metal grate, and stepped back.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>He and Dean stood momentarily silent, looking at it.</p><p>“I think when Doug Henning did this trick,” Dean said, “it worked out better.”</p><p>“Hang on.” Sam bent down and peered through the slots in the grate. He could see the rags piled up in there. They didn’t appear to have changed.</p><p>Pulling the fire door open again, he picked up a long iron poker that was leaning against the boiler and stuck it inside, extending it slowly toward the pile of fabric. He nudged it gently, like a kid poking a sleeping snake with a stick.</p><p>“I don’t get it.” He pushed harder, the tip of the poker scraping across the metal floor, throwing up sparks. “Maybe it needs more bl—“</p><p>The rags exploded.</p><p>It was like a rocket going off inside a tinderbox. Flame shot out of the fire door in a thick jet of blue headed right toward Sam’s face. At the last instant he jolted sideways, the poker flying from his hand, clattering across the floor, and for a dizzying second his equilibrium was gone and he almost fell out of the cab.</p><p>Dean’s hand swung down and grabbed his collar, pulling him back.</p><p>“Shut the door!” Sam shouted. “Get it closed!”</p><p>Dean grabbed the poker and rammed it forward, aiming at the grate again and clapping it shut. Blue flames spewed and flickered eagerly out of the slots, writhing like serpents’ tongues.</p><p>All around them, the railway cab gave a massive shudder and a sharp clank. Dean could hear the sound of old iron as the air around him filled with churning smoke, steam creaking through the engine’s pipes, its valves straining under long forgotten pressure. The needles sprang to life on the gauges in front of him, twitching and arrowing upward in great optimistic leaps.</p><p>He could see tiny puffs of vapor hissing from the boiler’s seams.</p><p>Dean clung onto a pipe, felt it growing hotter in his hand until he couldn’t hold on any longer. He leaned out of the doorway. One of the women—Dean thought it was the sheriff—was shouting up at him from the flatcar.</p><p>“What’s going on? Is it working?”</p><p>Before he could answer, the locomotive jerked forward. In July 1938, the locomotive Mallard set the land speed record for steam on a run from London’s King’s Cross station, England, on the East Coast Main Line. Officials clocked her at a hundred and twenty-six miles per hour before the engine’s bearings started to overheat and the engineer had to slow it down. “Any more speed, lads,” he’d supposedly told his fireman, “and we’d be sitting down for a kip with the Almighty Himself.”</p><p>When the Winchesters saw the outskirts of Mission’s Ridge coming up in front of them, they weren’t traveling quite that fast—probably only eighty, although it felt like a hundred up in the cab, where Dean had the throttle all the way open. The whistle screamed steadily overhead. The other valve-control was a hand-release lever called the Johnson bar. A half-mile from downtown, Dean had his Johnson running full-tilt, as well.</p><p>Within minutes, they’d be there.</p><p>The train rocketed hard down the tracks, pistons pounding, chuffing smoke. It was impossible not to think of it as a living thing. Dean held the regulator steady at maximum as the last of the woods blurred past them, giving way to houses and farms.</p><p>“Dean!”</p><p>Standing up in the cab, his eyes tearing up from the wind and velocity, Sam had to shout to be heard.</p><p>“We have to stop!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>“That’s crazy! It—“</p><p>Then Dean saw why.</p><p>Up ahead in the distance, where the first storefronts and shops marked the beginning of Mission’s Ridge proper, the tracks were covered with bodies.</p><p>And some of them appeared to be still alive.</p><p>McClane had gotten the idea at the last moment, looking at the poor bastard impaled in front of Blockbuster. He’d heard the locomotive’s whistle shrieking off in the distance and understood immediately how the Winchesters were bringing the noose back to the church.</p><p>Kneeling down in the middle of Main Street, resting his hands on the rails, he could already feel them humming.</p><p>“Quick!” he said. “Somebody get me some kids!”</p><p>They were tied to the tracks.</p><p>Dean could see the faces from a hundred yards away, though for a moment his mind refused to accept it. A little blonde girl in a blue dress and white tights, her face a pale porcelain sculpture of pure terror.</p><p>Behind her, arms and legs tied, were maybe a dozen other children from town, all looking up and screaming—some silently, others not. His heart froze. A single thought pulsed through his mind—Where are their parents?—but the answer was already there, pounding like the wheels underneath them.</p><p>Possessed. Or worse.</p><p>Dead. Dead. Dead.</p><p>Dean grabbed the air brake and yanked it back as hard as he could. Tortured metal howled. The engine lurched hard, its couplings slamming together between the cars, pistons fuming, wheels grinding, dumping off showers of sparks in every direction, but still ramming forward, ensnared in its own momentum.</p><p>“There’s not enough time!” Sam shouted.</p><p>The train scraped on, brake shoes hissing as the locomotive slithered inexorably down Main Street on insufficient friction. They were slowing down—twenty, now fifteen miles per hour—but the process was taking too long. Dean stood at the brake, his mouth pinched into an expression of absolute concentration, as if he could somehow stop their progress through sheer force of will.</p><p>Sam jumped.</p><p>Dean didn’t even realize Sam had done it until he saw his brother, not just running, but flat-out sprinting, ahead. He saw something flash in Sam’s hand, it looked like a pair of pliers, and then he was actually moving along the rails in front of the locomotive.</p><p>Reaching the blonde girl tied to the tracks, Sam pushed the pliers down and started snapping ropes, chopping through them as fast as he could. Once freed, the girl sprang up tearfully, and he turned to the next child, a five-year-old boy in a ripped t-shirt and grubby red shorts.</p><p>He got the boy’s arms free, but his legs were slick with sweat and grease from the tracks, and he wouldn’t hold still. Then Sam got it, and the boy scrabbled away.</p><p>He moved on to the next one, but behind him now, he could feel the bulk of the train roaring closer, not just shaking the rails but pounding them, shocking them to life with a steady, awful vibration of unthinkable force and power.</p><p>He looked up at the rest of the children. So many of them—too many of them—ten more at least, each tied tightly and separately into place.</p><p>They were all staring straight at him.</p><p>The shadow of the train swept down. And Sam Winchester understood he wouldn’t be able to save them all.</p><p>He turned around and looked.</p><p>The train was still coming.</p><p>Fifty feet away.</p><p>Thirty.</p><p>Twenty.</p><p>He stood paralyzed, riveted to the spot. Fate seemed to be pointing its skeletal finger directly at him. For one illogical moment he considered throwing himself down on the tracks in the hope of providing the last necessary bit of obstruction. Maybe it would save the last kid in line. Maybe it would—</p><p>He shut his eyes.</p><p>With a final scraping squeal, the engine halted.</p><p>He looked up again. It was less than three feet in front of him. He could have reached out and touched the cowcatcher.</p><p>“Sam!” Dean shouted, from up in the cab. “Cut those kids loose! We’re sitting—“</p><p>Then, from the upper windows of Main Street, the first gunshots rang out.</p><p>The adrenaline was on him now, and Sam worked fast, his trembling hands moving with almost superhuman speed. But he wasn’t fast enough. Two of the kids were injured, one cut by his pliers, the other hit in the leg by a stray bullet.</p><p>When he glanced around, Dean was next to him with Ruby’s knife, and they hunched together slashing the ropes in quick deliberate swipes, getting the kids loose and pushing them hard toward the nearest open doors on the far side of the street.</p><p>They could feel bits of sidewalk and asphalt spitting up at them as the muskets fired.</p><p>Sam didn’t need to look up to know what was happening.</p><p>Demons were shooting down from both sides, spanking the concrete with a hail of grapeshot.</p><p>They’re shooting around me, he thought. They still don’t want to harm the vessel.</p><p>When he flicked his gaze up again, he saw the last of the children ducking into the shelter of a restaurant called Whotta Lotta Pizza. Ten seconds later, the pizza parlour window burst apart under heavy gunfire. He hoped—prayed—that the kids were smart enough to stay down.</p><p>Hemmed in by bullets and utterly exposed, Sam looked at Dean. He could see the soldiers now and realized that the first fusillade of shots had been playful, meant to instill fear. But playtime was over. They were crouching in windows and standing on top of buildings, and the comparison to The Gauntlet wasn’t just some rallying cry anymore. It was happening, and they were in the middle of it.</p><p>We’re dead meat, he thought. Or at least Dean is.</p><p>Suddenly, from the flatcar at the back of the train, he heard a new sound, a mechanical clanking noise. A steady stream of blasts accompanied it, as if someone back there had just opened up with a machine gun.</p><p>What the—</p><p>Before Sam understood what was happening, the demons started falling. From above, along the rooftops, they dropped their weapons and were pitching backward in every direction, flung aside in twitching ballistic dances. Sagging, they went limp and then fell forward, plummeting to earth as if they themselves were no more than Hell’s own re-enactors, playing out their own Light-bringer’s famous descent from grace.</p><p>He glanced back at the flatcar.</p><p>Sheriff Daniels was standing behind the Civil War Gatling gun, turning the crank with a fierce concentration. The smoking barrels rotated steadily, spitting out a firestorm upward and around. The iron shafts were gleaming with a pale scarlet color where they’d been wiped down with the bloody rags.</p><p>Daniels worked the crank faster. Behind her, Sarah Rafferty held the turret of the gun, rotating the sheriff around to spray the upper rooftops.</p><p>The sheriff saw Sam watching her, and took one hand off the gun, pawing violently at the air.</p><p>“Get moving,” she shouted. “Run!”</p><h2><span id="chapter-38">CHAPTER 38</span><a href="#chapter-38" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lunging back up into the cab, Dean didn’t wait for further orders.</p><p>He disengaged the airbrake, only peripherally aware of Sam jumping in behind him as he grabbed the throttle with both hands and swung it wide. The train lurched forward on the rails. Bullets rattled and caroomed off the iron locomotive car in a steady clatter of lead.</p><p>Straight ahead and four blocks away, he saw the church. Its white steeple rose up into the blue morning sky like an annunciation from on high.</p><p>“Go!” Sam shouted.</p><p>A metal fragment whined and ricocheted past Dean’s ear, close enough that he felt the breeze, and he ducked belatedly, grim-faced. The next one could just as easily take his head off, he knew.</p><p>The engine was still picking up speed. It would’ve been faster to run.</p><p>We never would’ve made it.</p><p>In front of the engine, a phalanx of demons stood on the tracks, firing directly at the train as it rammed toward them. Sheriff Daniels brought the Gatling around and mowed them down. A second later the engine roared over their bodies, spitting out gobbets of flesh and shredded uniforms beneath the wheels.</p><p>Dean didn’t even see them. His eyes were nailed to the church, its front steps and its front door.</p><p>Two blocks now.</p><p>Closing in.</p><p>Get ready.</p><p>“Sam!” he shouted.</p><p>When Dean hit the brakes again, his brother was positioned halfway back in the coal car, clutching the sides, headed for the flatcar.</p><p>“Take the sheriff with you,” Sam called up. “I’ll stay here and try to hold them off as long as—“</p><p>His toe struck something soft. The words broke off in his throat, and he stared down at the body in the coal car. Something opened up in the pit of his stomach, hollow and quavering, as if he’d gone plunging downward.</p><p>The body of Sarah Rafferty lay motionless at his feet, her upturned eyes half-open, glassy. A bullet had struck her chest, creating a small red splotch that stained her blouse between her breasts, no bigger than a silver dollar. Beneath her, the stain was much bigger, and Sam realized that he was standing in a pool of her blood.</p><p>“Oh no...” Dean was shaking his head. “Is she...?”</p><p>Sam looked at his brother. He opened his mouth and closed it. When he spoke finally, his voice didn’t sound as if it belonged to him.</p><p>“Go.” Stepping over Sarah’s body, he got to the Gatling gun and touched Sheriff Daniels’ arm. “You have the last coil of the noose?”</p><p>She held it up.</p><p>“Right here.”</p><p>“Go with Dean.”</p><p>Daniels stepped out and Sam took her place, grabbing the gun’s blood-slick handle and cranking it hard. Out of the corner of his eye he saw Dean and Daniels jumping off the train and running between the pillars and up the front steps of the church. Two demons jumped out from behind one of the pillars, and Sam took aim and tore them to pieces.</p><p>Dean and the sheriff disappeared inside.</p><p>Sam dropped the Gatling’s crank and knelt down next to Sarah’s body, dragging her as far as he could into the relative cover of the coal car. Bullets spanged and rattled everywhere.</p><p>He put his hand to her throat to feel for a pulse. She was still warm—it had only been moments.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>“He’s in here somewhere,” Daniels whispered. “I can feel it.”</p><p>They crossed the sanctuary, the hardwood floor creaking faintly beneath their feet. Daniels’ voice sounded small amid the cavernous emptiness. Light coming from the variegated stained-glass windows fell across her face like a succession of ever-changing moods. Dean followed after her, padding in silence between rows of empty pews leading up to the dais. The only things he felt was hurt and tired.</p><p>And oddly cold. It was unnaturally frigid beneath the high arched ceiling, as if some lost vestige of winter had stayed canned up inside, waiting for them.</p><p>“Through here,” the sheriff said in a low voice.</p><p>She stopped in front of the pulpit. There was a high oak platform rising fifteen feet above them. Running her fingers along the outer edge, Daniels found what she was looking for and pressed on it. There was a click of some mechanism uncoupling, and the pulpit’s front panel dropped open to reveal a dark rectangle of dusty space directly in front of them.</p><p>Crouching, she ducked through it, vanishing inside. Dean heard her and wished for a flashlight.</p><p>Then blackness swallowed him whole.</p><p>They were in a narrow passage, the walls tight enough that he could feel them on both sides, brushing against his shoulders. Off in the void, the shuffling sounds of Daniels’ footfalls led him forward an inch at a time. Dean stretched his hands out in front of him, groping for something of substance and touching only air.</p><p>He crept forward.</p><p>Reaching...</p><p>And feeling something cold and tight grab him from behind. A hand.</p><p>“There you are,” McClane’s voice spoke brightly in his ear, laughing. “You made it after all.”</p><p>Hunched down in the coal car, Sam bent over Sarah, doing chest compressions, alternating with rescue breaths. When he pushed down on her chest, blood bubbled up from underneath her blouse.</p><p>She’s dead. You can’t save her.</p><p>He ignored the voice.</p><p>Kept working.</p><p>“Come on,” he said, unaware that he was speaking aloud. “Come on, Sarah.”</p><p>Her mouth dropped open slightly, as if she’d just remembered something she’d wanted to say. Instead, a shiny blood-bubble formed at her lips and burst, painting her lower lip with a bright smear of kabuki makeup.</p><p>Her head rolled to one side.</p><p>Footsteps rang out in the coal car behind him, and when Sam lifted his head, he saw five demons in blue and gray uniforms grinning down at him. The barrels of their muskets looked huge in his face.</p><p>“You should never have left the gun,” one of them said. It drew closer.</p><p>It’s up to you now, child.</p><p>Jackie Daniels came off the ladder and stepped down into the square, lead-lined room.</p><p>It was absolutely dark in here, drained of every germ of light, but that didn’t matter. She knew this space by heart. The walls, floors and ceiling, and the square of dirt in the middle where the reliquary waited—these intricacies were as familiar to her as her own body. She’d been made to learn all of it when she was young, instructed by her grandfather when he’d told her of the enormous responsibility that lay before her as the next guardian of the noose.</p><p>It’s up to you.</p><p>In the darkness, something clinked, dragging closer.</p><p>Daniels froze. Her scalp prickled, the sensation spreading down between her shoulder blades. Her heart sped up, pounding so hard that she could feel it in her throat. She smelled old animal skins, ancient fabric and dust.</p><p>The jingling, clinking sound grew closer.</p><p>“I brought it back,” she said into the darkness, and she forced herself to take another step. She almost expected to collide with the jingling shape—that was how close it felt. “The last coil. It’s here.”</p><p>The jingling shape moved again. It must have heard her, but it didn’t speak.</p><p>Kneeling down, she felt the damp crumbs of dirt and the cold edge of the reliquary. It was already in place—open and waiting.</p><p>She dropped the last coil inside, and snapped it shut.</p><p>For an instant nothing happened.</p><p>Then everything did.</p><p>* * *</p><p>In the darkness, McClane’s laughter was very close, the sound of it horribly familiar. It smelled like sweat and burning rubber and brimstone.</p><p>“You know something?” Dean said, doing everything he could to keep his voice steady. “You know the difference between you and me? I never bent down to kiss the devil’s ass.”</p><p>The laughter stopped.</p><p>Dean felt the other hand land on his throat.</p><p>Not a hand.</p><p>A claw.</p><p>Squeezing.</p><p>The vice-grip shut his airway down instantly, and there was an almost inaudible popping sound as the cartilage began to crush inside him.</p><p>Dean’s hand went to his belt, where he’d tucked the demon-killing knife, and he drew it out.</p><p>Hope you got it where it needs to go, Sheriff, he thought, and as the darkness began to spin, he plunged the blade into McClane’s chest.</p><p>Even on his knees inside the coal car, Sam could see the light erupting out of the church windows, flooding the stained-glass Bible scenes from the inside and spraying the colors into the morning air. A pillar of pure white light shattered its way through the steeple and into the sky, cutting a wide bright shaft of radiance straight up into the cloudless expanse. The old planks creaked, knocking together, rattling hard. Energy shuddered and throbbed from inside, a pulsing storm of megawatt intensity, as if some silent, benevolent detonation had just occurred.</p><p>At that point Sam stopped watching.</p><p>He was more preoccupied by the demons smoking out in front of him, their muskets falling to the bottom of the coal car. The last of them collapsed with a yowling cry of anger and dismay, its black substance swirling out through its nose and mouth.</p><p>The host-bodies lay where they fell.</p><p>Some groaned and awoke, injured, confused, bleeding from the injuries to which the demons had subjected them.</p><p>Others, like the body of Sarah Rafferty, remained still.</p><p>Dean didn’t just hear Tommy McClane scream—he felt it. He’d been prepared for the demon to flash out, but the simultaneous return of the coil to its proper resting place must have somehow amplified what happened. The demonic essence didn’t just flee, it exploded.</p><p>There was a loud, moist pop, accompanied by a spraying sensation against the bare skin of his cheek and forehead, and the crushing pressure on his throat was gone.</p><p>Just like that.</p><p>Dean cringed. His skin was freckled with something cold and sticky, as if a balloon covered in cold syrup had burst open in front of him. The stink was familiar, rotten and nauseating—halitosis from Hell.</p><p>Then the darkness itself exploded.</p><p>Dean’s hair stood up on the back of his neck, stiffening across his forearms. The numbing crackle of ozone filled the air. His first gut-reaction was that he’d been hit by lightning, and he began to back up as quickly as he could.</p><p>The lightstorm opened up around him in every direction. It was flashing through the sanctuary in vast, booming pavilions of pure luminescence as he charged out of the open passageway, down the center aisle, and through the front door.</p><p>Sam saw his brother racing for the front steps, leaping down them all at once and landing on the sidewalk, then whirling around to watch the last of the light ebbing away inside the First Pentecostal Church of Mission’s Ridge.</p><p>When it finished, he turned and looked up and down Main Street. Columns of smoke rose over the buildings, no doubt from a handful of fires that burned in various parts of town.</p><p>The demons’ host-bodies lay everywhere, dangling from windows and sprawled across rooftops. Sam watched them stirring, starting to stand up, wincing and clutching their injuries. Debris littered the sidewalks, broken glass and collapsed awnings, and a layer of airborne murk that was already dissolving in the atmosphere.</p><p>Car alarms hooted and shrilled, the modern day birdsong of early morning catastrophe.</p><p>“Sammy?”</p><p>Sam climbed down, carrying Sarah’s body.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Dean said.</p><p>“Where’s the sheriff?”</p><p>Dean nodded back at the church. Sirens were rising up now underneath the cacophony of car alarms. Sam imagined federal investigators, government officials and television reporters, state police, more suits and uniforms than he could imagine. They would descend upon Mission’s Ridge and turn it into a buzzing hornet’s nest of questions and accusations and delays.</p><p>“We don’t want to be here for this,” he said.</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Dean said, “I’m not leaving Sheriff Daniels.”</p><p>“Impala’s in the impound lot. Two blocks from here.”</p><p>Dean brightened at the prospect of getting his car back and somehow found the strength to smile.</p><p>“I’ll bring it around.”</p><p>“I’ll go in and look for the sheriff.” Sam set Sarah’s body down next to him, turned, and started toward the church.</p><p>As he did so, the front door squeaked open, and he saw Sheriff Daniels emerge from the church and into the light. Her face was glowing, almost sunburned, her eyes bright, utterly vibrant.</p><p>“Are you all right?” he asked.</p><p>She looked down at him, at first not seeming to recognize him, then out at the ruined streets of her town, the bodies of the citizens, and those who were regaining their bearings, coming out of hiding.</p><p>“Yes.” Her voice was far away. “Are they gone...?”</p><p>Sam nodded. He could already hear the familiar growl of the Impala’s engine making its way closer. A moment later it appeared around the corner and pulled up to the curb. Dean opened the door and climbed out. Sheriff Daniels stood looking at them.</p><p>“I guess none of us was straight with the other,” Dean said.</p><p>“I suppose not,” she agreed.</p><p>“My brother and I...” Sam began, and paused, unsure how to proceed. “We came because we knew there was demonic activity here. We’re hunters.”</p><p>The sheriff nodded.</p><p>“I’m glad you came. My job—my real job, protecting the noose—isn’t easy. My family has given their lives to it. Sometimes literally.” She shrugged. “I’m not used to having any help.”</p><p>Sam looked over at Sarah’s body.</p><p>“I wish we could have done more.”</p><p>“I probably wouldn’t have let you,” Daniels said. “I’m used to being the only one who knows what’s really going on. But it can be hard protecting everybody when you can’t trust anyone.”</p><p>The words seemed to weigh on Dean in particular.</p><p>“Yeah,” he said, “I get that.” And then, glancing back at the car, he added, “Well, we should get going.”</p><p>Daniels nodded.</p><p>“My grandfather always said, there’s a time for headlights and a time for rearview mirrors.” She paused. “If you see your friend again, tell him I hope he finds what he’s looking for.”</p><p>Sam nodded. He and Dean climbed into the Impala. The sheriff stood at the curb, watching them drive away.</p><h2><span id="epilogue">EPILOGUE</span><a href="#epilogue" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After the Civil War was over, the world watched the South’s long Reconstruction through newspapers and eyewitness reports and telegraphs. It was perhaps appropriate, then, that Sam and Dean Winchester watched the reconstruction of Mission’s Ridge on TV in St. Mary’s Medical Center in Athens, Georgia.</p><p>Dean’s most fervent wish, that the hospital’s cafeteria food would at least be decent, proved to be relevant—they didn’t leave there for almost two days.</p><p>Mission’s Ridge was on every channel, local and national. The town was still in flames, figuratively if not literally. In the wake of what had happened, investigators and the media were discussing everything from bioterrorism to mass hallucination to religious hysteria. All the usual analysts, crisis experts, and pundits were brought in to comment.</p><p>Larger discussions of the Civil War, Southern culture, and racism loomed large in the background, and Dean Winchester, who tended to think about “big themes” the same way that alcoholics think about hangovers, stopped listening.</p><p>But still he watched.</p><p>Sitting out in the waiting room, looking at the screen, he saw Sheriff Jacqueline Daniels talking to reporters from the steps in front of her office, patiently answering questions and proffering explanations. She didn’t seem worried. She looked calm and utterly professional.</p><p>Yet every so often Dean would see something in her eyes, a flicker of deeper recognition, as if she somehow knew he was out here, fifty miles away, watching her on TV.</p><p>Nah, she’s got bigger fish to fry, he mused. Besides, she was a real tough cookie.</p><p>He wondered what it might be like if he could drive back to the Ridge one more time, catch her in between interviews, take her out for a beer and a bump. Would a woman like that drink whiskey? Dean had no doubt that she would.</p><p>Give it up. Put her on the list. Ones that got away.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>He looked over and saw Sam standing next to him. The bandage on Sam’s face looked white, clean and entirely out of place.</p><p>“Ready to go?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>They walked back through the waiting area, out of the door toward the parking lot where the Impala was waiting. It was a perfect afternoon in late spring, cloudless, and Sam could smell the live oak. He glanced up to see a familiar figure standing next to the car waiting for them.</p><p>“Cass,” Dean said. “Sorry again about the whole Witness thing.”</p><p>Castiel looked away without comment.</p><p>“Did you ever talk to him?” Sam asked. “To Judas?”</p><p>“Yes.” Castiel appeared even more dour than usual, as if pressed down by some burden so heavy that he alone could measure its weight. “Enough to...”</p><p>He let the words trail off with a shrug.</p><p>“Can we give you a ride or something?” Dean asked.</p><p>The angel shook his head.</p><p>“I’ve made other arrangements.”</p><p>“So you just dropped by to bum us out?” Dean asked. “Make us feel bad for surviving another go-round with evil incarnate? You want me to buy you a balloon or something? How about a beer?”</p><p>“A beer?”</p><p>“You’ve heard of that—I bought you one before. And there’s a place not far from here. I’m ready for a brewskie myself.” Dean looked at Sam. “Come on, what do you say? I bet they have Bad Company on the jukebox.”</p><p>Castiel faced them gravely.</p><p>“Those demons were organized. They had a plan, and access to a relic against which we had almost no defense, and they fully expected to force Sam into becoming Lucifer’s vessel. These days are darker than ever.” His gaze was dark, galvanic with foreboding. “What happened in Mission’s Ridge was more than some freak incident. With the Apocalypse imminent, it was indication of things to come.”</p><p>“Look, Cass...” Dean started, and the rest of the words trailed away. I might as well be talking to empty space. He shook his head. “Great.”</p><p>“Come on,” Sam said to his brother. “Get in.”</p><p>They got in the Impala and Dean started the engine, pulling out of the parking lot and driving toward town. The bar they ended up at was called the Stars and Bars, and although there was indeed beer and Bad Company on the jukebox, they didn’t stay long—they drank their drinks and moved on.</p><p>By seven o’clock in the evening they were back on the highway, heading north. Sam was still thinking about Sarah, but he left the great state of Georgia with few regrets.</p><p>Sheriff Daniels was right, he realized.</p><p>There is a time for headlights and a time for rearview mirrors.</p><p>Tonight, that was good enough for him.</p><p><strong>THE END</strong></p><h2><span id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><a href="#acknowledgments" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Although this manuscript was edited on a book tour in hotel rooms and airports across the country, I wrote the first draft in my basement, under the tightest deadline of my life—a little over three weeks.

But as exhausted, dehydrated, and sleep deprived as she was, it was difficult to be sure.</p><p>Crammed into the first of several filthy, claustrophobic vans, nineteen-year-old Letty had felt self-conscious and anxious. She was one of only three females in a group composed primarily of rough, posturing men. A skinny, awkward girl that boys barely noticed back home in Tláhuac. But they noticed her now, and some of the men made crude comments about her, encouraging each other to pinch her meager breasts.</p><p>It had got worse after Marta, the only person who had been nice to her, had been bitten by a snake and had to be left behind. Marta tried to make Letty take her water, since she knew she was dying and didn’t want it to be wasted, but Letty couldn’t bring herself to leave the older woman with nothing. Now, in the unrelenting heat with the heartless sun burning her scalp and blurring her vision, Letty wished she’d taken the water after all. Maybe if she had, she wouldn’t be imagining things. Like the beautiful woman.</p><p>They’d made it over the border just before dawn and were hunkered down, waiting for nightfall. At which time another vehicle was supposed to pick them up and take them the rest of the way to the safe house in Phoenix. Their Coyote, a nickname given to border-crossing guides by the migrants they smuggled into the States, had left them. The spot where he told them to wait was nothing but a cluster of thorny brush and jagged rock. Barely enough shade to shelter a single person, let alone a large group. The Coyote himself had been picked up by another smuggler on an all-terrain vehicle (ATV), leaving behind a single two-liter bottle of warm, gritty water and dire warnings to stay hidden and listen for helicopters.</p><p>As morning became midday, the killing heat started picking them off one by one, like a lazy sniper. One of the young men who’d grabbed Letty’s breasts was now unconscious, slumped like a drunkard and barely breathing. He’d stopped sweating. A young woman whose name Letty had never learned was already dead. The flies had found her. The water was long gone.</p><p>But the beautiful woman didn’t seem phased by the heat at all. She sat in the sand with her legs crossed and the hood of her black sweatshirt up, shading her eyes. Her supple lips were not cracked and parched. Her smooth, pale skin was clean and untouched by sunburn. She didn’t have a backpack. She didn’t speak. She just watched the sun travel across the sky. No one seemed to notice her but Letty.</p><p>The unconscious man was dead by the time the promised vehicle arrived, a weary old cube truck with bald tires that did not look up to the task of navigating the rough, unpaved road. Two other men were barely alive and had to be dragged into the truck by their friends. Letty was so thirsty and so exhausted that she could barely stand, but she managed. She wasn’t about to give up now. The beautiful woman was close behind her as she staggered to the rear bumper of the truck and climbed inside. It smelled like urine and human misery. The Coyote pulled down the roll door and padlocked it with a heavy chain. The engine rumbled and coughed, filling the airless space with the stench of exhaust.</p><p>Letty sat on her backpack and concentrated on not throwing up. She couldn’t spare the water. That’s when she realized the beautiful woman was now sitting right beside her. The woman had pushed back her hood and her wild curly hair brushed Letty’s cheek, smelling like woodsmoke and copal.</p><p>“My name is Letty,” she whispered in Spanish to the beautiful woman, just to distract herself from the churning nausea.</p><p>It was too dark inside the truck to see the woman’s expression or if she was even listening at all. If she was, she didn’t reply.</p><p>“I’m going to Los Angeles to work in my cousin’s poultry shop,” Letty continued, nervous and talking too fast. “Plucking chickens. My brother thinks this is funny, because he calls me Chicken Neck. Ever since we were kids. Because I’m skinny, you know, like a chicken’s neck. He won’t think it’s so funny when he sees how much money I’ll be sending our grandmother. And soon, I’ll have enough money to bring her and my daughter to live with me. My daughter’s name is Marisol. She’s three.”</p><p>Even though it was too dark to see, Letty was suddenly certain that the woman was looking right at her, listening intently.</p><p>“Shut up,” one of the men hissed, digging an elbow into Letty’s ribs. “You sound just like a chicken.”</p><p>Letty shut up. Time passed. She could feel herself dozing, half dreaming of swimming naked through cool water.</p><p>Then Letty heard something that yanked her back into reality. Another engine. The crunch of tires. Another vehicle was approaching. There were a few short pulses of a siren and an incomprehensible foreign voice barked through a megaphone. A flash of desperate panic burned through the cramped and airless space and swiftly dissipated, leaving behind an apathetic kind of resignation. They were locked in. Nowhere to run. It was over. They were caught.</p><p>Letty was not proud of what she’d done to pay off the Coyote, and she knew in her heart that she could never put herself through that kind of hell again. This was her one and only chance to make it to the United States, to make a better life for her daughter. To make sure that Marisol would never have to do the kinds of things her mother had been forced to do. Now it was all falling apart. Her one chance, slipping through her fingers.</p><p>The truck slowed, then stopped. Without realizing she was doing it, Letty reached out and grasped the beautiful woman’s arm. At least that’s what she thought she had done. But what her fingers found didn’t feel anything like a woman’s skin. It felt first like the dirty, brittle hair clinging to a week-old roadkill dog and then more like the cold, chitinous plates of a scorpion’s tail. Then flesh again, human flesh burning with a fatal fever and squirming with movement like busy maggots wriggling just beneath the skin.</p><p>There was a strange sound. An unnatural growl so deep it was more felt than heard, rumbling beneath a wet crunching like fresh bones being cracked for marrow. Letty yanked her hand away, letting out a small, airless scream. Her head was spinning with vertigo, as if the beautiful woman were a deep hole and Letty were falling into her. Falling, or drowning. The smell of copal smoke sharpened in the airless space and that’s when the thing that used to be a beautiful woman leapt at Letty, not a hole anymore but real, all teeth and terrible, howling rage.</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Marco Salazar watched the smuggler’s truck approaching through night vision binoculars. Behind the wheel was a luckless Coyote named Fernando “Ojon” Ruiz Hierra. Ojon got his nickname because of his large bulging eyes, but it had become a joke around the station that Ojon couldn’t see a 747 flying an inch from his nose. He was a loser, plain and simple, notorious for letting his charges die from dehydration before they even hit the border. But he was cheap, and there was no shortage of desperate migrants willing to take that risk in hopes of making it through to the land of opportunity. He’d been popped twice by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and skated by both times by claiming to be just another migrant in the group. All their evidence against him was circumstantial and none of the people he smuggled would testify that he was a hired guide because of his connections with a local drug cartel. The second time, they’d tried to hold him on re-entering the U.S. as a prior deportee, but strings had been pulled and they’d had no choice but to send him back to Mexico again, along with all the others. Salazar figured it was only a matter of time before his connections decided Ojon was more trouble than he was worth and put him out of their mutual misery.</p><p>But it was looking like that time might come sooner rather than later. Now that they’d caught Ojon behind the wheel of a truck full of migrants, the charges against him would finally stick and he’d end up getting shanked in prison instead of gunned down in the street. Of course, taking him out of the picture wouldn’t stop the endless flow of migrants, but maybe there’d be fewer senseless deaths in Salazar’s sector.</p><p>Salazar’s earpiece crackled, and then CJ’s voice cut through the static. Not saying anything special, just confirming the visual on the approaching truck and asking for permission to move in. But the sound of her voice made him flush hot, suddenly sweating under his body armor despite the cool desert night.</p><p>Border Patrol Agent Cara Jean Hogeland had only been on his team for three months. She was twenty-seven, thirteen years younger than Salazar. Hardly a beauty, she had a long, horsy face and frizzy red hair that stuck out every which way, but she was six feet tall with legs that could kill a man and eyes that let you know she had your number. Salazar had been married for nine years and had never been unfaithful. CJ had made short work of that.</p><p>It had been a terrible idea from the start. Terrible because it would break Rena’s heart if she ever found out and terrible because he was CJ’s superior officer. The threat of a sexual misconduct charge was serious business in a division that was still more than eighty percent male, but even knowing he could lose both his job and his family over this kind of indiscretion, he just couldn’t keep away from CJ. In cheap motels, in the back of his SUV, and one memorable occasion in the men’s room at the gun range. He thought about her nearly every waking minute of every day. He thought about her when he really ought to be thinking about not getting shot. He was thinking about her right now as he watched her and her partner, veteran agent Davis Keene, move their vehicle into position for the intercept.</p><p>He gave Keene and CJ the go ahead, then shouldered his rifle to cover them, watching their SUV through the infrared scope. Both times they had arrested Ojon, he had made the same crazy headlong sprint into the brush. Both times he tripped and fell on his face within 100 yards and was easily apprehended. Yet, Salazar was willing to bet he was going to do the exact same thing tonight. Like somehow, this time would be different. No chance of that.</p><p>Salazar checked his watch. He figured they’d have Ojon in custody and the thirsty migrants processed and ready to be deported well before 3 a.m. Which would give Salazar three full hours with CJ before he had to go home to his sleeping wife and children.</p><p>Keene pulled their SUV into the road, cutting the truck off while CJ hit the spotlight. The truck braked in a swirling cloud of dust and Keene’s voice boomed over the loudspeaker, telling Ojon to keep his hands where they could see them and not make any sudden moves. Of course, Ojon threw the driver’s side door wide open and took off into the scrub.</p><p>Salazar didn’t bother to shoot him. It was more entertaining to watch him run and fall. Keene took off at a comfortable pace after the fleeing Ojon. Salazar watched CJ’s white-hot, shimmering shape in his infrared scope as she threw her head back and laughed. He thought about the way she’d throw her head back just like that when she was on top of him. He wiped his sweaty hand on the leg of his uniform pants and then put his finger back on the trigger.</p><p>CJ made her way around to the back of the truck, checked the padlocked chain wound around the door latch, then took a sudden step back, hand on the butt of her side arm.</p><p>Salazar’s heartbeat surged, senses suddenly sharp and all thoughts of CJ’s anatomy washed away in a gush of adrenaline. Something was very wrong. He could feel it in his gut.</p><p>“Talk to me, CJ,” he said, instantly wishing he’d called her by her last name like every other officer on his team, but too concerned about her safety to worry about sounding overly familiar on an open frequency. “What the hell’s going on down there?”</p><p>“Sounds like...” CJ replied. “Like he’s got some kind of... zoo animal in there...” Salazar could hear a burst of terrified screams in the background. The truck was rocking on its axles. CJ drew her gun and took another step back. “Oh my God it’s...”</p><p>“Hold your position, Hogeland,” Salazar said, already half-running, half-sliding down the steep embankment toward the truck. “Keene, forget Ojon. We got a major situation here.”</p><p>“I just got him zipped,” Keene replied.</p><p>“Leave him!” Salazar said. “We’ll pick him up later.”</p><p>That was when the back of the truck burst open, roll-up door wrenched from its hinges and left dangling by the padlocked chain. Something leapt out and took CJ down, some kind of huge, lanky dog maybe, but whatever it was, it was inexplicably difficult to look at. Like its edges weren’t solid, but jittering and shifting with a seizure-like intensity. It gave off waves of rage like heat off a desert road at high noon.</p><p>Salazar tried to draw a bead on it, but focusing on its roiling shape was almost impossible and made the backs of his eyeballs ache. All he could see was CJ, laying there in the sand, head thrown back like it had been when she was laughing, when she was making love to him. Only now that sleek, muscular neck had been torn wide open, a fine crimson mist filling the air around what used to be her face as her body still tried to breathe through a ruptured windpipe. And then suddenly, that fierce, feral rage was focused on him.</p><p>He got off two shots before it was on him, tearing the rifle from his grip.</p><p>Ojon knelt in the sand, hands zip-tied behind his back. He couldn’t believe this was happening now, tonight. He had this blonde stripper in Phoenix who he was pretty sure would give it up the next time he saw her. He could tell she really liked him, not like all those other guys in the club. She obviously respected him, because of his reputation and connections to Las Maras. And even though she said she didn’t do that kind of thing, he knew she’d feel different when she saw the fat roll he collected from this latest crossing. Not to mention the nice clean eighth of coke he was planning to give her as a tip. La pinché Migra. They’d probably take that too.</p><p>Truth was, he was getting tired of these Coyote runs. It was way too hard, guiding all these stupid goats through the harsh desert. Sure, the pay was good and it got him laid by desperate women that were dying to get to the States, but he felt like it was high time he moved up in the organization. Something cushy, like sitting in a big office somewhere, telling people what to do over the phone while getting a chupada from his sexy secretary. He figured he’d talk to his cousin Beto about that as soon as he was processed and released.</p><p>When he heard shots, Ojon scrambled awkwardly to his feet and spun toward the truck. He couldn’t see what was happening from his angle, so he crept closer, peering through the brush and trying to get a glimpse of the action. When he did, he wished he hadn’t.</p><p>At first, he thought he was looking at a naked woman with wild black hair, facing away from him as one of the CBP officers drew down on her. If there had been a woman like that in the group, Ojon was sure he would have noticed. In fact, he definitely would have offered her his special discount. The officer was an older man, late forties with salt-and-pepper hair and a thick mustache. Ojon remembered him from one of his previous arrests, remembered that he was a real hardass. But he wasn’t acting like a hardass now. He was staring at the naked woman with wide eyes and a look first of horrified recognition and then stunned disbelief. The disbelief became terror as the thing that looked like a naked woman melted into something different. Something terrible.</p><p>Ojon turned and ran.</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean Winchester eased the Impala up to eighty miles per hour. It was a knockout of a day. Sunny and perfect, like a vintage ad for America the Beautiful. Sky so blue it hurt. The red rock canyons of Sedona, Arizona had given way to windswept dunes as they headed west, toward the California border. He had a belly full of good greasy burgers from a Mom and Pop roadside stand a few miles back. Iron Maiden’s “Running Free” pumped through the speakers. His brother Sam rode shotgun, long legs bent at what had to be an uncomfortable angle and balancing his laptop on his knees, a scattering of clippings and photos spilling across his seat. The road seemed to stretch out forever. If Dean squinted, he could almost pretend things were the way they used to be. The way they were supposed to be.</p><p>Then the song ended and a new one came on. When Dean heard the opening riff of ACDC’s “Hell Ain’t a Bad Place to Be” he reached out and switched the music off.</p><p>Sam didn’t seem to notice or care that the music had stopped. He was utterly absorbed in whatever he was reading.</p><p>“Got something?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Maybe,” Sam replied.</p><p>Minutes and miles rolled by in silence, broken only by the shuffle of pages and the click of keystrokes. Dean could feel the cumulative weight of everything he’d been trying to forget crouching between them like a solid living thing. The elephant in the room. So much left unsaid. So much that had already been said and could never be taken back.</p><p>“So,” Dean finally said. “You gonna share with the rest of the class?”</p><p>“Border Patrol intercepted a truck full of illegals just south of Choulic,” Sam responded. “A routine stop. Only something went wrong and the officers involved never reported back at the station. When they sent a back-up unit out to the last known location, they found fifteen mutilated corpses, including the three officers. COD is listed as ‘wild animal attack.’”</p><p>“Fifteen corpses, at least three of which were heavily armed and probably wearing body armor? That’s some animal.”</p><p>“Our kinda animal,” Sam said, clicking through to another page. “Truck door was busted open from the inside. Says here there’s been some speculation that the smugglers involved may have been trying to import some type of large exotic mammal, like a tiger or a bear.”</p><p>“Great.” Dean rolled his eyes. “Not another damn werewolf.”</p><p>Sam shook his head. “It gets weirder.”</p><p>“Doesn’t it always?”</p><p>Sam showed one of the photos to Dean, who glanced sideways to look at it.</p><p>“Can a werewolf do something like this?” Sam said.</p><p>The photo showed an official Customs and Border Protection SUV. Well, half an SUV. A little less than half, to be precise. The front half was perfectly normal, undamaged. The back half had been removed with surgical precision, metal and plastic melted shiny smooth along the cut edges. As if someone had drawn a slightly curved line in the sand and everything on one side of the line had simply vanished, while the rest remained untouched. On the ground nearby was the uniformed body of a CBP officer. His Kevlar vest was torn to rags. So was he. And he didn’t have a head.</p><p>“Werewolves are stronger than any normal predator, but their claws can’t go through Kevlar like that.” Sam tapped the photo. “And what the hell happened to the SUV? It looks almost like some kind of large protective circle had been drawn and then everything inside the circle disappeared. Transported, maybe. But where?”</p><p>Dean glanced over at his kid brother. Sam was staring intently at the laptop screen once more. He’d caught the scent of something new and was intrigued. It was the closest thing to a human emotion that Dean had seen in his brother’s face since Sam had been brought back from Hell.</p><p>Maybe this was just what they needed. Something to take their minds off the big picture.</p><p>Dean could feel the old, familiar excitement building inside him. The thrill of the hunt. He looked away toward the raw, jagged mountains. Was he kidding himself to think that they could forget the past and the weight of a potentially bleak and hopeless future and lose themselves in an interesting job? Maybe so, but that wasn’t gonna stop him from trying. He needed a distraction too badly.</p><p>“Where the hell is Choulic anyway?” Dean asked, turning back to Sam.</p><p>The corner of Sam’s mouth twitched, just a little. Dean chose to interpret that as a smile.</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Choulic, Arizona turned out to be pretty much nowhere. A few trailers, and a ranch with three stoic horses watching the Impala from behind a crooked, endlessly repaired fence. A gas station straight out of the forties that sold beer and Jarritos soda from a Styrofoam cooler, along with weird “Indian Curios.” A billboard advertising a rattlesnake roundup that was supposedly “fun for the whole family.” That particular episode of wholesale reptile genocide had already happened more than four months ago.</p><p>If the town of Choulic itself was nowhere, the actual location where the truck and the bodies had been found was even further away from anywhere. The road, such as it was, was barely more than two hardened ruts in the stony ground. The amount of abrasive grit and yellow desert dust that was rapidly coating the Impala’s slick black skin was starting to give Dean heart palpitations. He silently promised her a carwash the second they got what they needed from this particular patch of nowhere.</p><p>Sam was out the passenger door even before Dean had come to a complete stop. Dean sat for a moment with his hand on the key in the ignition, just watching. Sam had the EMF meter out and was walking a careful grid across the area where the event had occurred. Dean killed the engine and got out himself. He already felt that there was something disturbing about the place.</p><p>The heat was all over him the second he left the air-conditioned comfort of the Impala. There was hot and then there was this. Within seconds, his T-shirt was soaked through with sweat. The sun was swiftly barbecuing the top of his head and forcing his eyes down to a tight squint even behind his dark sunglasses. Suddenly, the idea of wearing a cowboy hat made perfect sense. He tried to imagine what it would be like to cross this inhospitable desert on foot.</p><p>“How do people live out here?” Dean asked, stepping up next to Sam and pulling his damp shirt away from his sticky chest. “I’ve been here five minutes and I already feel like a 7-Eleven hotdog in a microwave.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam replied, smirking without looking up from the readout. “But it’s a dry heat.”</p><p>“Hell’s a dry heat, too,” Dean said. “It still sucks. Let me know if you pull anything. I’m gonna go get a cold beer and pour it down my pants.” He looked around uneasily.</p><p>“I got nothing,” Sam replied, shrugging. “The area’s clean. Whatever happened here, I don’t think it’s tied to this location and it didn’t leave behind any detectable fluctuations.”</p><p>If there had been any ordinary physical evidence, blood or tire tracks or anything like that, the stealthy, endlessly shifting sand had erased it. Nothing physical and nothing electromagnetic. No sulfur. No visible hexes. Nothing at all except for a strange feeling in the pit of Dean’s stomach. A sense of profound wrongness about what had happened there.</p><p>“Heads up,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean turned to face his brother. Sam gestured to the left with his chin.</p><p>“Looks like we got company,” he said.</p><p>There was a rocky ridge about twenty-five feet away from the road that Dean realized gave a perfect sniper’s view of the location where the attack had occurred. At the crest of the ridge was a figure in black astride a matte-black custom Suzuki Hayabusa motorcycle. The figure’s eyes were hidden behind the dark visor of a full-face helmet, but there was no doubt that the brothers were being watched.</p><p>For a handful of heartbeats, nothing happened. The three of them just regarded each other in silence. Then the Hayabusa’s engine turned over with a throaty roar, the bike spun 180 degrees in a spray of gravel and dust, and the mysterious figure was gone.</p><p>As the sound of the bike’s engine faded into the distance, Dean turned to Sam with a slight frown.</p><p>“Nice bike, the Hayabusa,” he said. “But pretty noisy.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam said. “So?”</p><p>“So,” Dean said. “Did you hear a motorcycle engine at any point since we got here?”</p><p>The desert around them was quiet and peaceful. The only sounds were the raspy, repetitive call of a small bird, the bone-dry rattle of wind through thorny brush, and the whisper of sand around their boots.</p><p>“Or how about on the drive out here?” Dean continued. “Hell, I don’t think we passed a single vehicle on the road since that crappy pick-up about ten miles back.”</p><p>Sam’s eyes went wide. He got it.</p><p>“Whoever that was,” Dean said. “They were already here. Waiting for us.”</p><p>The brothers didn’t discuss the appearance of the mysterious rider on the drive from Choulic to Bullhead City, but Dean found himself mulling over the incident, wondering. Could it have been an off-duty CBP officer who had taken a special interest in the case? If so, how did they know Sam and Dean would be there? Or did they? Was Dean reading too much into it? Could it be a simple coincidence that they both chose the same time on the same day to check out the location? But Dean didn’t think so. Coincidence was a concept that normal people used to explain away things they didn’t understand. Things Dean understood all too well.</p><p>Maybe it had been the perp, returning to the scene of the crime?</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, pulling the Impala up to a modest but immaculately landscaped Spanish-style home on a residential street. “Tell me more about Officer Headless.”</p><p>“Davis James Keene,” Sam replied. “Age forty-seven. Hardcore evangelical Christian. Born and raised right here in Bullhead. Highway patrol officer for ten years before joining CBP. Wife Loretta doesn’t work outside the home. Four kids. All boys, all grown.”</p><p>“But the question is, what makes him different than the other two murdered Border Patrol agents?” Dean asked, killing the engine and pulling the keys from the ignition. “I mean all the corpses were in bad shape, but Keene’s body seems to have suffered way more damage than the other victims. Like whatever did this was particularly pissed at him.”</p><p>Too hot and sweaty—at least in Dean’s case—to face putting on their FBI suits, they had decided to go plain-clothed for this interview, figuring the grieving widow would have other things on her mind than to question their attire. Dean opened the glove compartment and pulled out a pair of fake FBI badges and handed one to Sam. Sam took the badge and shrugged.</p><p>“I guess that’s what we’re here to find out,” he said.</p><p>The woman who answered the door was surprisingly beautiful. From Sam’s description, Dean had been expecting some kind of sweet, chubby church-lady type. Loretta Keene looked more like a retired fashion model. Mile-high legs under a short sundress. Elegant cheekbones and big blue eyes that were just starting to crinkle at their corners. Thick blonde hair pulled back in a casual ponytail. Her feet were bare, toenails perfectly polished. She looked tired, like she’d been crying.</p><p>Dean showed her his badge.</p><p>“Mrs. Keene?”</p><p>The woman nodded, let out a resigned sigh. She stepped aside to let Dean and Sam enter without asking them who they were or what they wanted.</p><p>The interior of the house was just as immaculate as the exterior. Tasteful, but not too expensive. Simple brown-leather furniture and lots of well-groomed houseplants. Photos of four good-looking, athletic boys at various ages. A fresh lemony smell of recently applied furniture polish. The large windows were crystal clean. Not a speck of dust or a single item out of place.</p><p>But the thing that Dean found the most unusual about the room was what wasn’t there. Not one single religious object. No bibles. No crosses. No framed religious sayings. Nothing to indicate that they were in the home of an evangelical Christian.</p><p>“I’m Special Agent Crockett,” Dean told the woman. “This is Special Agent Tubbs.” Sam shot Dean a warning look, but Dean ignored him, face still deadpan serious. “We’re investigating the unusual circumstances surrounding your husband’s death.”</p><p>Loretta Keene picked up a small spray bottle and started misting the leaves of a large potted ficus, her back to Dean.</p><p>“It’s like he knew this was coming,” she said, almost too softly for them to hear.</p><p>“What makes you say that,” Sam asked, frowning slightly and taking a step closer to the widow.</p><p>She looked down at the spray bottle and shrugged.</p><p>“From the day Davis and I met, it was... We had this... this crazy kind of passion. That’s the only word I can think of to describe it. Passion. He was the love of my life. We couldn’t keep our hands off each other.” She blushed and turned back to the plant, spraying it again, even though it was already soaked. “All my girlfriends said that would change once our first baby was born, but it didn’t. Not then, anyway. Not until years later.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam but didn’t say anything. They just waited for her to continue.</p><p>“This was fifteen years ago. Ritchie, our youngest, was seven. I remember because it was the day after his seventh birthday party. Everything was normal, the way it always was. Davis had just started working for the CBP. Nights, which was tough for me, because we really only saw each other for a short time each evening before he left. But we would always... Anyway, he left for work that night and...”</p><p>She finally turned to look at Dean. Her eyes were shimmering with unshed tears.</p><p>“I feel like that was the last time I saw my husband.” She put the spray bottle down on the windowsill beside the damp ficus. “I’d like a drink. Would you boys like a drink?”</p><p>“We’re not allowed to drink on the job, ma’am,” Sam replied before Dean could say yes.</p><p>“I’d like a drink,” she said again, to no one in particular, then drifted slowly out of the room.</p><p>“Crockett and Tubbs?” Sam said, leaning close to Dean and speaking fast and low. “Come on. Isn’t that a little too obvious? You oughta stick with your usual obscure rock and roll names.”</p><p>“Just trying to spice up our relationship,” Dean replied. “But listen, never mind that.” He tipped his chin toward the doorway though which Mrs. Keene had drifted. “Booze in the house. No visible religious stuff. All this sex talk. You sure about this born-again thing?”</p><p>Sam looked down at the file folder in his hand. Rifled through some papers.</p><p>“According to this, the Keenes have been active members of the Living Word Baptist Church for fifteen years.”</p><p>“Fifteen years,” Dean echoed.</p><p>Mrs. Keene returned with a heroic three-finger knock of straight Bourbon in a thick, square glass. She tossed back more than half the amber liquid and then drifted over to the glossy leather couch. She didn’t sit, just stood there.</p><p>“You were saying,” Dean prompted.</p><p>“Was I?” Mrs. Keene looked puzzled and slightly anxious, like she’d just woken up in an unfamiliar bed. She sat down after all.</p><p>“You were saying,” Sam reminded her. “That you felt like the last time you saw your husband was fifteen years ago.”</p><p>“Right,” she said. “The day after Ritchie’s seventh birthday party.” She downed the rest of her bourbon. “Davis went to work that night just like he always did, but when he came home, he was like a different person. Shut down inside. He never touched me again.”</p><p>She shook her head, shifting the empty glass from one hand to the other. Dean felt a terrible empathy for her, all alone in that clean, perfect house, as empty as her glass.</p><p>“I know something happened that night,” she continued. “But he would never talk about it. He made us all get baptized the next day. I went along with it because it was easier than trying to argue him out of it, but I never really believed. I haven’t been back to church since his funeral. Closed casket, of course, since they never found his head.” She was suddenly angry, bitter as frostbite. “I mean, what’s the point? So I can listen to a bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites tell me that what happened to Davis was God’s will?” She made a harsh, half-suffocated sound that was probably meant to be a laugh. “God’s will? I don’t want any part of a God that would let something like that happen to one of his followers.”</p><p>Lady, Dean thought, you don’t know the half of it.</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Border patrol officer Manuel Léon didn’t know what to make of his new partner. Charlie Himes was a decent guy, but very guarded. Didn’t joke around. Didn’t say a single word that wasn’t directly related to the job or responding to a specific request. He was the only black guy on the Tijuana River ATV team and he was also the oldest by a good ten years. Léon was the youngest. They were a Mutt and Jeff team, Himes tall and wiry and Léon short and stocky. Their CO called them Rocky and Bullwinkle. But despite their differences, they’d been working pretty well together for these past four days. Himes been showing Léon the ropes along the river, and although Léon might have preferred to partner with someone he could kid around with a little every now and then, Himes was a crack shot, had a black belt in Brazilian Jiujitsu, and held the highest arrest record in the unit. He was in better shape than most guys half his age. Léon could do worse.</p><p>Their designated section of the Tijuana River was barely what you’d call a river. It was more like sludgy trickle of toxic chemicals and raw sewage that ran along a wide cement channel littered with dead dogs, burning tires, and discarded needles. The stench was overwhelming, but that never stopped people from wading through the filth to try and make it to the American side. Himes claimed that you got used to the smell after a while. Léon wasn’t sure if he believed that. There weren’t enough showers in the world to wash the memory of that smell out of Léon’s head.</p><p>It was just after midnight when they spotted a trio of junkies squatting and huddled together on the American edge of the river. Male in an illegible death metal T-shirt and dirty jeans. Long, tangled hair and lurid red Kaposi’s sarcoma legions on his arms and face. Two females. One overweight and painfully young. Childish, pink-and-black T-shirt featuring a bad knock-off of Hello Kitty. Way too much bloated belly exposed between the hem of the shirt and the saggy waistband of her torn pink leggings. Faded pink hair, with a good six inches of black roots. Maybe sixteen, tops. Dead, hopeless eyes. If she was sharing needles, and who knew what else, with her male companion, she was probably already HIV-positive. Léon hoped she was just fat, and not pregnant. The second female wore a hooded sweatshirt, hood up and curly black hair spilling out from around its edges. Jeans and dusty hiking boots. What skin was visible was corpse pale in the harsh sodium lights. The first two were totally absorbed doing something furtive with their hands, probably prepping their heroin, but the second female sat stone still and seemed to be watching the border patrol agents. Léon couldn’t see her eyes under the hood, but she gave him the creeps.</p><p>“Paid diversion,” Himes said as they pulled their ATVs up on the lip of the channel.</p><p>“Paid?”</p><p>“Smugglers pay junkies to shoot up along the river,” Himes told him. “Divert our attention away from their operations.”</p><p>Himes lifted the visor of his helmet and raised a pair of compact binoculars to his eyes to get a closer look at the action. He watched the junkies for a silent minute, then handed the binocs over to Léon. Léon pushed up his own visor and scoped the trio for himself, adjusting the focus and zooming in on the male junkie’s hands.</p><p>Sure enough, he was dumping something from a tiny plastic envelope into a metal bottle cap. The chubby girl was pressed up against him, holding a disposable lighter and a syringe. She had sparkly glitter polish on her bitten nails, and a cheap ring shaped like a star.</p><p>“Should we try to apprehend them?” Léon asked.</p><p>“We can try,” Himes said. “But they’ll probably run back over to the Mexican side.”</p><p>“So, what?” Léon said. “We just watch them?”</p><p>Léon was zoomed in so tight that when something suddenly happened, it just looked like a fast shuffle and blur. He lowered the binocs, squinting at the three junkies. Now there were only two of them. They were both laying face down in the oily sewage, rivulets of crimson feeding out into the sluggish current. The chubby girl didn’t seem to have a head.</p><p>“What the...”</p><p>He turned to Himes and saw that the second female was standing right beside them, between the two ATVs. She was inexplicably nude. Impossible, but not any less possible than her running all the way up to the top of the steep concrete bank in the half a second it took Léon to lower his binocs. Her chin and chest were slick with gore. Her eyes did not reflect any light, just swallowed it all and gave nothing back. She was holding something, something that Léon’s baffled brain translated as a dirty red mop. But when he saw that the mop had streaks of pink, he realized what he was really looking at. It was a human spine with the head still attached, clotted pink hair brushing back and forth against the naked woman’s bare toes.</p><p>Léon looked at his partner. Crack-shot, bad ass Himes. Highest arrest record on the team. He didn’t draw his weapon. Didn’t take action. He was just staring at the woman with a drowsy kind of dread, like a suicide on a ledge, looking down. Like he knew what was coming. Like he deserved it.</p><p>When the girl dropped the spine and leapt on Himes like a hungry animal, Léon scrambled sideways off his ATV, thought processes utterly short-circuited by what he was seeing. It would have made sense to punch the gas and speed away, but he wasn’t thinking. Couldn’t think. All he could do was stumble backward, hands up and head shaking in endless, wordless denial. Because the woman was changing, form and substance flickering like a fire, bleeding off into the air around her as she tore into Himes with raptor claws and a thousand jagged teeth dripping glistening venom like rattlesnake fangs.</p><p>Léon tripped and fell on his ass as what used to be a woman threw back what used to be a head and screamed. That sound, that agonized, furious scream, was the single most terrible sound Léon had ever heard. Then something happened that was so strange, stranger even than all the other madness of the previous impossible moments, that Léon could feel his mind snap like a broken bone. In a way, it was almost a relief, not to have to try and make sense of anything anymore. Because there was no way to make sense of what he was seeing.</p><p>The sky around the woman’s head was unfolding. The earth was torn wide open like Himes’ corpse and things started to fall upward, twisting like trash caught in a high wind. There was a blinding flash and a burst of excruciating pain like a plane crash inside Léon’s head and then the woman was gone. So were the two ATVs and Himes’ body. So was the lower half of Léon’s body. Everything from the navel down was gone, neatly severed and bloodless for a surreal moment. Then, the blood came in a dizzy sickening rush, flowing down into the oily river and mingling with the blood of the dead junkies. Léon thought he heard the buzz of ATVs, backup on the way, but it didn’t matter. It was too late.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean stood at the single window of a motel room. He’d been looking out at the freshly washed Impala sitting in the mostly empty parking lot, but now let the scratchy plaid curtain drop. The room was identical to every room he’d ever stayed in, nearly invisible in its generic blandness. The only thing that stood out and reminded him that he was in Arizona rather than Nebraska or Montana or Vermont was a creepy painting of an anthropomorphic saguaro cactus wearing a cowboy hat and a mildly demented expression on its prickly green face. When they first checked in, he’d been tempted to take it down and stash it in the closet, but discovered that it was bolted to the wall. Like anyone in their right mind would want to steal that atrocity.</p><p>Sam had his laptop set up on the rickety table on the other side of the narrow room, surrounded by open files and crumpled papers.</p><p>“So what have you got on little Ritchie Keene?”</p><p>“He’s in a band.” Sam said. “They’re terrible.”</p><p>“How about something useful? Like his DOB?”</p><p>“April 16th,” Sam read off the screen. “1988.”</p><p>“When Mrs. Keene was talking about whatever she thinks might have happened to her husband on the job,” Dean said, “she referred to it as the day after the youngest son’s seventh birthday party. Not the day after his actual birthday.”</p><p>“Still,” Sam said. “At least that narrows it down, gives us a window of about a week or so. I’d say we should look for something that occurred between April 10th and 20th, 1995.”</p><p>“Looks like I’d better pay a visit to our friends at Customs and Border Protection,” Dean said. “Where was Keene stationed?”</p><p>“There’s no way either one of us is getting into a CBP station,” Sam said.</p><p>“Why not?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Look,” Sam replied. “I want to bag this creature too, but we need to play it smart. Weigh the risks. A CBP station isn’t some podunk sheriff ‘s office where you can fool everyone with slick talk and a fake badge. In case you haven’t been keeping up on current events over the past eight years, the CBP and the Department of Homeland Security have combined forces to crack down on any possible terrorist threat to our great nation. And they take their jobs very, very seriously. I think it’s safe to say they’re basically Dean-proof.”</p><p>“I’m deeply hurt by your lack of faith in my ability to sweet-talk,” Dean replied, opening the closet door and pulling out a garment bag containing two unremarkable navy-blue suits. He unzipped it, removing the smaller of the two jackets. “I’m like the Chuck Norris of sweet-talking.”</p><p>“I’m serious, Dean,” Sam said. “Federal prison serious.”</p><p>Dean pulled off his T-shirt and slipped into the white button-down that had been hung underneath the jacket.</p><p>“What? You’re saying you couldn’t go on without me?” Dean buttoned the shirt and draped a dull striped tie around his neck. “You love your dear big brother so much that it would break your heart if I went to prison?”</p><p>Sam looked away.</p><p>“I’m just trying to be practical,” he said.</p><p>“Practical,” Dean repeated, tightening the knot on the tie. “Uh huh. Just give me the damn address.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The Nogales Station of the CBP was probably one of the most unfriendly looking buildings Dean had ever seen. He’d seen prisons that looked more welcoming.</p><p>The officer at the archive check-in desk was female. According to her laminated photo ID, her name was Ariana Cruz. She looked way too young for the job. Wide, heart-shaped face and big brown eyes. Pretty, even with minimal make-up and her dark hair pulled back into a no-nonsense bun. The sweet, kid sister type. No wedding ring.</p><p>“You must be Ariana,” he said, flashing the most charming smile in his arsenal. “Ray Sandoval told me that you were the one to talk to about pulling some old records.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, you are...?” She blushed, dropping her gaze.</p><p>“I’m Special Agent Allman,” Dean told her. “I’m sure Sandoval must have mentioned that I was coming.”</p><p>He badged her with the FBI ID, holding it low, just to the left of his belt buckle. Trying to make her feel embarrassed about looking too closely at that area of his body and keep her focus upstairs, on his face.</p><p>“Well... I...” She picked up a clipboard, scanning over a list of some sort.</p><p>He took a step closer, one hand on her desk. He didn’t want to overplay it and act all pervy. Just give her the impression that he liked what he saw but was trying to be professional about it.</p><p>“It took me three weeks to get all the paperwork together to cover the transfer of document custody,” he told her. “I’d hate to have to go through that all over again.”</p><p>“I’ll need your badge number,” she said.</p><p>Dean pulled out a very official-looking business card with the FBI logo and Bobby Singer’s phone number. Held it out to her.</p><p>“If there’s a problem you can contact my superior back in DC,” he told her.</p><p>“I need to enter your badge number into the system for security cross-check,” she said. “It’s standard procedure.”</p><p>“Listen, Ariana,” he said, leaning in and lowering his voice, making it softer, more intimate. “I know you hate all that paperwork just as much as I do...”</p><p>She cut him off before he could continue.</p><p>“You’ve always had it easy with women, haven’t you?” she said. A funny little smile curled in the corner of her mouth. “I can see why. And, you know what, I’d love to lie to you and tell you that I can get you past security if you take me back into the supply closet and show me a good time. Just for my own selfish reasons.”</p><p>Dean couldn’t help but laugh. Some innocent kid sister.</p><p>“But let’s face facts,” she continued. “Even if you rocked my world, which I have no doubt that you would, I still don’t have the power to let you in without performing a security cross-check and issuing a bar-coded visitor ID. If you want to bypass security, you’ll have to show my superior officer a good time.”</p><p>A new voice, masculine, deep and slightly accented, spoke up behind Dean.</p><p>“That would be me.”</p><p>Dean turned to face the owner of the voice. Latino, late fifties with thick, perfectly groomed white hair and incongruous pale-blue eyes set in a deeply lined face the color and texture of old saddle leather. He wore the same uniform as Cruz but with higher-ranking insignia. His photo ID read “Raphael De La Paz.”</p><p>“Sorry, sir,” Cruz replied, blushing even deeper and awkwardly shuffling papers on her desk. “This is Special Agent Allman, here about some old case files. I just need to get his badge number...”</p><p>De La Paz looked at Dean.</p><p>Dean couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt so profoundly scrutinized. By a normal human being, anyway. It was like that unflinching gaze was riffling through the drawers of his mind. Dean was sure the game was up.</p><p>There was a fingerprint scanner beside the clipboard on Cruz’s desk. If they printed him, it would only take a few clicks on a computer to call up Dean’s less-than-sterling history with law enforcement. Sam had been right. This was a spectacularly bad idea.</p><p>“Come into my office, Agent...” De La Paz gave Dean another searching look. “What did you say your name was again?”</p><p>“Allman,” Dean said, sweating in earnest now. He knew perfectly well that the older man hadn’t forgotton the fake name he’d given Cruz.</p><p>“Right,” De La Paz said. “Cruz, take a break. Smoke. Coffee. Facebook. Whatever.”</p><p>“Yes, sir,” she said.</p><p>De La Paz turned and headed down the drab, fluorescent-lit corridor. Dean saw no choice but to follow. As they walked, Dean noticed the older man limping slightly on his right leg. De La Paz opened a metal door labeled with his name and gestured for Dean to enter.</p><p>Dean stepped inside the cramped, windowless office. It was pin-neat and minimalist. Standard, government-issue metal desk, nearly bare except for a phone, a small, outdated computer monitor, and a single framed photo facing away from Dean. Two identical chairs, one behind the desk and one in front. One wall was lined with large, alphabetized filing cabinets, making the small room feel even smaller.</p><p>De La Paz stepped in behind Dean and closed the door. There was barely enough room for the two of them to stand side by side in front of the desk. Dean wondered for a moment if maybe Cruz had been serious about him showing her boss a good time, but De La Paz just squeezed past him and sat down behind the desk. He motioned for Dean to take the other chair.</p><p>“I’ve worked Border Patrol for twenty years,” De La Paz said. “Seventeen of those years in the field, before a Zeta bullet put me behind this desk. People tell you all kinds of stories. Some are true. Most aren’t. You learn to know the difference just by looking at ‘em. At their eyes. I never even listen to what people say anymore. I just look at their eyes.”</p><p>Dean shifted in the uncomfortable chair, feeling like he was twelve years old again and back in the principal’s office.</p><p>“I know you’re not an FBI agent.”</p><p>The uncomfortable chair squeaked under Dean’s weight as he shifted again, a subtle torture device that amped his discomfort up to eleven. He ran every angle, every possible response over and over in his head and still came up empty. He looked down at his sweating hands. Some Chuck Norris.</p><p>“But I also know you’re not a criminal or a terrorist,” De La Paz continued. “You probably like to think of yourself as some kind of rebel, but you have the soul of a lawman. I see that in your eyes.”</p><p>Dean squinted at the older man, wondering where he was going with this.</p><p>“You’re carrying a hell of a lot of scar tissue for someone as young as you are.” De La Paz sat stone still, never taking his eyes off Dean as he spoke. “But we all get calloused on account of the things we’ve seen on the job. Things we’ve done. Things the people we protect could never understand. Those things have made you cynical, but deep in your heart you still believe in justice, don’t you?”</p><p>Did he? Dean had no idea how to answer a question like that.</p><p>“You know I oughta turn you in,” De La Paz said.</p><p>“What’s stopping you?” Dean asked. If De La Paz really was going to blow the whistle, Dean wished he’d just get it over with already.</p><p>“Maybe the fact that you remind me of someone.” De La Paz pulled a bottle of top-shelf tequila from a desk drawer, along with two shot glasses. “A complicated, driven man with eyes like just yours. Met him back when I was your age. Still young enough to think I knew everything about everything.” He looked down at the bottle, shaking his head with a slight smile. “That man sure proved me wrong.” He opened the bottle, poured two modest shots. “His name was Winchester. John Winchester.”</p><p>De La Paz held one of the shot glasses out to Dean.</p><p>“Pleased to meet you, Dean,” De La Paz said, raising his shot glass and clinking it against Dean’s.</p><p>Dean tried to no-sell his surprise, but he was pretty sure his jaw was in his lap.</p><p>“You knew who I was this whole time?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I had a pretty good idea.” He smiled. “I suppose you might have been Sam, but you’ve got firstborn written all over you.” He tossed back the tequila and set the glass down on his desk. “Now why don’t you tell me what this is really about.”</p><p>Dean looked at the older man for a moment, then at the tequila. He wondered what supernatural horror had brought his dad and this guy together, but figured this wasn’t the time to ask. He just had to hope that they had both been on the same side. He sucked in a deep breath, downed the shot, and took a risk. A risk he was probably out of his mind for taking. He told De La Paz what this was really about.</p><p>Dean laid out everything they knew. Everything they’d found out up to that point. Including their suspicion that the thing responsible for the attacks wasn’t human.</p><p>De La Paz listened without interrupting, poker-faced and giving Dean no idea if he was buying it or if he was planning to call the men in white coats to come take Dean away.</p><p>When Dean was finished, De La Paz nodded. He didn’t immediately arrest him or call the men in white coats, he just sat there for a minute in thoughtful silence.</p><p>“So you’re saying that you think someone, or something, had it out for Keene because of an event that occurred on the job fifteen years ago?”</p><p>“Pretty much.”</p><p>More silence. Had Dean made a mistake, trusting De La Paz? Just because the older man knew their father didn’t necessarily mean he knew everything. Maybe they just had a couple of beers and talked about baseball. But there was something about De La Paz that Dean couldn’t quite put his finger on. Something that made Dean instinctively trust him.</p><p>The phone on De La Paz’s desk rang, startling Dean a little.</p><p>“Excuse me,” the older man said, lifting the receiver. “De La Paz.”</p><p>He spoke for a minute in Spanish, his tone intimate and soothing, like he was telling someone not to worry. He covered the mouthpiece and whispered to Dean.</p><p>“My wife. Every time she sees something on the news, she thinks I’m in danger, even though I’ve been working archives for three years now.”</p><p>De La Paz listened to whatever was being said to him, and suddenly, his eyes went wide. He made a quick excuse to his wife and hung up.</p><p>“What...?” Dean began, but De La Paz held up his hand for quiet and then started tapping away on the computer.</p><p>Dean waited, feeling that hot excitement building inside him again. He had the feeling that he was moving in on their prey.</p><p>“There’s been another ‘animal attack’ against our field officers,” De La Paz said. “Three, possibly four victims this time. One of them may have been Charlie Himes, currently MIA.”</p><p>Dean waited for the older man to elaborate.</p><p>“Himes was partners with Davis Keene, back when they were rookies, but he put in for transfer to San Diego...”</p><p>De La Paz stood and pulled open a file drawer, riffling through files till he found the one he wanted. He laid it on the desk, flipped through it until he found a particular piece of paper, then turned it around so it was facing Dean.</p><p>It was an application for transfer. De La Paz tapped the date with a thick, nicotine-stained finger. It said “April 18th, 1995.”</p><p>“...fifteen years ago,” De La Paz said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>De La Paz led Dean down another hallway to a door labeled “DOCUMENTS.” De La Paz swiped his ID through a bar-code reader next to the doorknob and pushed the thick metal door open.</p><p>“Welcome to the graveyard,” he said.</p><p>The room they entered was a cavernous, dusty warehouse space packed with row upon row of floor-to-ceiling metal shelving. The shelves were lined with thousands of identical cardboard file boxes.</p><p>“We’re working on getting all this old paperwork uploaded into the system,” De La Paz said. “But it’s a monumental task for which we are desperately understaffed. All the personnel files are in my office but any incident reports involving Himes and Keene from April of ‘95 would be stored here.”</p><p>Dean walked with De La Paz down the dimly lit rows, past 1997 and 1996, until they found a section marked 1995. The file boxes were in rough chronological order, but not exact, so it took them a few minutes to locate the later half of April.</p><p>“Okay, fifteen, sixteen,” De La Paz was saying under his breath. “Right, here’s the nightshift report that covers April 17th and 18th.” He pulled a file, opened it. “Officers Keene and Himes were teamed up with José Porcayo and Gilberto Brewer that night. At 8:37 p.m. on the 17th, there was a pretty substantial narcotics intercept. Three arrests, 500 pounds of cocaine seized. Then nothing all night until 2:58 a.m. on the 18th, when a small group of migrants was apprehended trying to cross the border, including an abandoned female infant, aged nine months, whose mother was never found.” De La Paz shrugged. “Doesn’t sound like anything out of the ordinary.”</p><p>Dean scribbled down the names of the two other officers in a small notebook, but he could feel a mounting frustration making him antsy, impatient. He’d always hated this kind of research. Sam was the librarian in the family. Dean much would rather be duking it out with demons than shuffling through old paperwork.</p><p>“But wait,” De La Paz said, just as Dean was about to thank him for his time and give up on this angle of inquiry. “This is strange.”</p><p>“I love strange,” Dean said, interest renewed. “Lay it on me.”</p><p>“One of the migrants picked up that night was a sixteen-year-old kid named Anibal Obregon Hernandez. In his statement, he asked to file a complaint against the arresting officers. At first he claimed they raped and murdered a woman in the group. Several hours later, he changed his story and claimed the four officers, quote, ‘put a magic spell on her that turned her into a coyote.’ Unquote.”</p><p>“Bingo!” Dean said.</p><p>“You don’t really believe that’s what actually happened, do you?” De La Paz said, thick white eyebrow arched at Dean.</p><p>“Maybe not exactly,” Dean said. “Maybe that’s just a scared sixteen-year-old trying to make sense out of something he didn’t understand.”</p><p>De La Paz shuffled to another page and swore softly in Spanish.</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Hernandez recanted his testimony the next morning,” De La Paz said. “The complaint was never filed. They found him hanging in the holding cell less than thirty minutes before he was scheduled to be deported. He’d made a noose out of his own T-shirt.”</p><p>“Damn,” Dean said. “Do you think the officers involved may have gotten to him somehow, forced him to change his story?”</p><p>“Look, I don’t know much about magic spells or anything like that,” De La Paz said. “But these officers were good men. Regular guys you’d play cards with on your day off or invite to a family barbeque. I didn’t know Brewer that well, but Himes’s little girl went to first grade with my daughter. These guys aren’t some kind of evil wizards or satanists or anything like that. They’re just... guys. I’m having a really hard time believing they would do something like what that Mexican kid described. Magic or no magic.”</p><p>“Well, clearly something happened that night that scared the hell out of everyone who saw it,” Dean said. “Where are Brewer and Porcayo now?”</p><p>“Brewer retired early on disability,” De La Paz said, slipping the file back into the box. “Diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Porcayo left CBP to work in the private sector.” He turned back to Dean. “You don’t think that they’re in danger too, from whatever animal is doing this?”</p><p>Dean nodded, slipped the little notebook back in the breast pocket of his jacket.</p><p>“That’s exactly what I think,” he said.</p><p>Dean shook De La Paz’s thick mitt as he was leaving. The older man’s grip was strong and warm. The way things were, Dean found it difficult to trust anyone, even his own family, and it was astoundingly rare for him to meet a normal person as honest and open-minded as De La Paz.</p><p>“You didn’t have to help me,” Dean said. “Thanks.” He looked into the older man’s pale eyes. “And if you want the truth, I don’t know if I believe in justice anymore. I want to, but...”</p><p>“I understand,” De La Paz said. “Good luck out there, kid. You’re gonna need it.”</p><p>Once outside the CBP station’s air-conditioned cocoon, Dean trudged across the vast parking lot with his head down, feeling like an ant crossing a frying pan. He was sure the thin soles of his dress shoes were going to catch fire before he made it to the Impala. When he got there, the Impala’s door handle was almost too hot to touch.</p><p>He was pulling off his sweaty, wrinkled jacket and tossing it into the back seat when he spotted the rider in black right on the other side of the razor-wire fence.</p><p>The rider was much closer now, less than ten feet away, standing beside the parked Hayabusa. While the face was still hidden beneath a black helmet, it was clear that the body beneath the distressed, well-worn leather pants and black wife-beater tank top was curvy, unquestionably feminine. Every inch of visible, caramel-colored skin was covered in tattoos, all intricate, Aztec designs. Serpents and jaguars and skeletons. Women in elaborate feathered headdresses wielding leaf-shaped obsidian knives. Arcane symbols. Most were rendered in only black ink but the large, anatomically realistic heart on the left side of her chest was in lurid color, all lush red and purple, surrounded by golden flames.</p><p>Like a gunslinger in a classic Western, she wore a low-slung, elaborately tooled black-and-silver gun-belt with a holster on each hip. The nose of each holster was bound to one of her thick, muscular thighs with a leather strap. But rather than old-school six-shooters, Dean could make out the modern, ergonomic grips of what looked to be a pair of Heckler &amp; Koch tactical pistols. She was also wearing heavy, masculine boots and tight, wrist-length black leather gloves. She was not wearing a bra.</p><p>There was no way he could climb over the double razor-wire fence in time to catch her before she could get that bike fired up and away. And as much as he loved the Impala, she was no match, speed wise, for what was widely considered to be the world’s fastest motorcycle. The Hayabusa would be pushing 190 miles per hour before he could get the Impala up to fifty-five.</p><p>Dean approached the barrier.</p><p>“Who are you?” he asked, gripping the chain link of the fence between them.</p><p>She didn’t reply. Just regarded him for a moment through the smoked glass of her visor, then got back on her bike and was gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the way back to the motel, Dean took care of a few errands. Gassed up the Impala. Bottled water and beer. Ammo run. Unsurprisingly, it was pretty hard to find rock salt in the desert. Not a lot of icy driveways. One smartass clerk told Dean that if he wanted salt that badly, he should just grab a pickax and drive out to the Death Valley salt flats. Dean ended up with an obscenely expensive ten-pound bag of fancy gourmet salt crystals that were infused with truffle essence or some nonsense. He almost felt bad for the local restaurant he’d conned the supplier into charging for the salt, but he was sure the next demon he shot with the stuff would appreciate the “complex, earthy aroma and crisp mineral profile.”</p><p>He was deeply grateful that the endlessly glaring sun was finally sinking down behind the mountains by the time he got back to the motel. There was so much to process. So much he needed to tell Sam. Plans to be made. He figured the best course of action would be to have Sam dig up addresses for the other two men involved in the unexplained incident of April 18th, 1995 and then find them and warn them. Maybe stake them out, wait for their vengeful “animal” to show up and then gank the thing before it had a chance to hurt anyone else. But how could they pick which man to visit first? What if they picked wrong?</p><p>These were the thoughts running though his head as he fished the gaudy plastic key-tag from his pocket and unlocked the motel room door. He pushed it open, stepping gratefully out of the heat and into the room’s dim, cave-like sanctuary.</p><p>“You’re not gonna believe...” he began but stopped dead in mid sentence.</p><p>It wasn’t Sam sitting at the table, hunched over the laptop. It was the rider in black.</p><p>Her helmet was off, revealing dark, almond-shaped eyes, a fierce, pre-Columbian profile and wide, smirking lips. Her crow-black hair hung in a pair of thick, waist-length braids bound with leather strips.</p><p>Dean lunged forward to grab her and she leapt up, kicking the chair at him, jumping onto the rickety table and then diving for the open window. He batted the chair aside and swore under his breath as he threw his body in her path, blocking her escape.</p><p>She squared off, facing him, eyes wide and gloved fists raised. Standing toe to toe like this, he realized that, despite the aura of tightly coiled menace she radiated, she was actually surprisingly petite. Five foot three inches, tops. He had a good sixty pounds on her and was almost a full foot taller.</p><p>“Look,” Dean said, palms out. “I don’t want to hurt you.”</p><p>Before he could blink, she’d scaled him like a cliff-face, taking a step off his knee and another off his hip and then throwing a sharp, spinning kick to his face. He was quick enough to dodge the full force of the kick, but still caught a glancing blow on the jaw. He staggered backward.</p><p>She made a run for the door, but he grabbed one of her flying braids and yanked her back toward him, wrapping his arms around her from behind. She dropped straight down and out of his grasp, slippery as mercury, and then ducked backward between his legs. He spun to face her, narrowly avoiding an uppercut to the junk. He was finally angry enough to take a serious swing at her, but he may as well have sent her a Christmas card last year to let her know the punch was coming. She slipped in under his swing and gave him three short, tight body shots in the time it took him to throw just one.</p><p>Fighting her was like trying to fight a hummingbird. She was so small and so fast, but she didn’t really have enough power behind her punches to knock him out. Just piss him off. On the other hand, she still had those guns on her hips and she could decide to use them at any moment. Dean had a feeling she was a pretty quick draw.</p><p>He had no choice but to bull-rush her, using his size and strength advantage to power her into a takedown. He could tell he’d knocked the wind out of her and worked swiftly to immobilize her arms and keep both her hands up high, away from those pistols. She hissed and squirmed beneath him like an angry snake, and he was suddenly intensely aware of her braless breasts pressing against his chest and her leather-clad hips grinding against him as she struggled to free herself. She noticed him noticing and arch amusement flashed in her eyes. Dark eyes, just like Lisa’s. He felt a swift flush of heat, followed almost instantly by a cold chaser of guilt. That’s when he heard the soft, deadly snick of a switchblade.</p><p>Dean froze. He could feel the narrow blade pressed up under his chin as she rolled him onto his back and straddled him. Her face was inches from his. He could feel her breath against his lips.</p><p>“Take it easy,” Dean said, chin held high and eyes wide. “There’s no need for all this. I just want to talk.”</p><p>“So talk,” she said.</p><p>“Well for starters, how about telling me who the hell you are and why you’re following us?”</p><p>“I’m Xochi Cazadora,” she replied. “And I could ask you the same question.”</p><p>She had a fairly strong accent that wasn’t entirely Mexican. Something a little harder around the consonants</p><p>“Where are you from?” Dean asked, intrigued.</p><p>“Tenochtitlan. El D.F.” She pronounced it Dey Efey. “You call it Mexico City. My bloodline is Aztec.”</p><p>“You’re not gonna cut my heart out, are you?” Dean asked, looking down to see the knife still too close to his chin for comfort.</p><p>She smiled. “Try me.”</p><p>“Wait a sec,” Dean said. “Isn’t Cazadora a Spanish name? I thought you guys hated the Spaniards, because of that whole smallpox thing.”</p><p>“My people don’t have surnames.” She eased back on the blade just a touch. “Cazadora isn’t a name, it’s a job description. It means huntress.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The door to the motel room opened and Sam walked in with an armful of upscale Mexican takeout. He arched an eyebrow at the sight of his brother sprawled out on the carpet and straddled by a hot tattooed chick in leather pants.</p><p>“Am I interrupting...?”</p><p>“She’s got a knife on me, dude,” Dean said.</p><p>“Hey, man,” Sam said, setting the food on the table. “Whatever lifts your skirt.”</p><p>Xochi closed the blade and stood, offering Dean her hand to help him up. He didn’t take it, just stood up on his own.</p><p>“This is Xochi Cazadora,” Dean said to Sam. “She’s a hunter.”</p><p>“Sam Winchester,” Sam said, pulling a giant, foil-wrapped package from one of the brightly colored paper bags. “You’ve obviously met my brother Dean.” He offered the package to Dean. Dean shook his head so Sam offered it to Xochi instead. “Burrito?”</p><p>Xochi looked back at Dean, the same amusement still there in her eyes. She took the burrito.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, pocketing her gloves, unwrapping the foil and taking a large, voracious bite. She frowned down at the burrito’s contents. “What is this?”</p><p>“It’s a chicken fajita burrito,” Sam said with a shrug, taking out one for himself. “Don’t you like Mexican food?”</p><p>“Whatever this is,” she said. “It’s not Mexican food.” She shrugged, took another bite. “But it’s much better than raw rattlesnake. Got any hot sauce?”</p><p>“Um, hello?” Dean said. “I hate to interrupt your little dinner party, kids, but I’ve still got a few questions over here.”</p><p>Xochi walked over to the bags on the table, rummaged around until she found a large container of hot sauce and dumped it all on the burrito. Now that her gloves were off, Dean could see that her hands were heavily scarred. Knuckles crushed flat. Nails unpainted, cut short. A fighter’s hands.</p><p>“I’m not following you,” Xochi said. “You are not following me. Don’t you understand? We are both following the Borderwalker.”</p><p>“Borderwalker?” Dean eyed her suspiciously, trying to get a read on her. Figure out if she was on the level. “You mean you know what this thing is?”</p><p>She nodded. “I do. But I’ve been on the road a long time and I’m hungry. Tell me what you know while I eat, and then I will tell you what I know.”</p><p>“How do we know we can trust you?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You don’t,” she said.</p><p>“Forget it,” Dean said. “We don’t need your help.”</p><p>She paused for a moment with the burrito halfway to her lips, shot Dean a curious look, then went ahead and took the bite.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” she said, chewing. “I will still eat your burrito.”</p><p>“What do we have to lose, Dean?” Sam asked. “I think we should hear her out.”</p><p>Dean frowned. Sam’s face was unreadable.</p><p>“Give us a minute,” Dean said. “I need to talk to my brother. Alone.”</p><p>Xochi shrugged and took her dinner outside.</p><p>“We don’t know anything about this chick,” Dean said as soon as the door was closed. “We don’t even know for sure if she’s human. I don’t trust her.”</p><p>“Trust has nothing to do with it,” Sam said. “I want to hear what she knows about this thing.”</p><p>“Okay, so we just listen to what she has to say,” Dean said. “And then she leaves, right? I don’t want her tagging along with us.”</p><p>“Why not?” Sam asked. “Because you don’t want to let a girl into the Monster Club? Or is it because of what happened to Jo Harvelle?”</p><p>“What the hell does that have to do with anything?” Dean asked, feeling like he had lost the argument before it had even started.</p><p>“Look, from what I saw, this girl’s got skills,” Sam said.</p><p>“She can obviously take care of herself and she knows what we’re dealing with here. Why not take advantage of that? We can use her to help us hunt this thing and if she tries to screw us over along the way, well, then I’ll handle her.”</p><p>“Handle her?” Dean frowned. “What do you mean handle her? Give her a stern talking to? Put her over your knee?”</p><p>“Is this gonna be another one of your Jiminy Cricket lectures?”</p><p>“You mean kill her, don’t you?” Dean couldn’t believe he was actually having this conversation. “Sam, what if she is human?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. Dean shook his head, made a disgusted noise.</p><p>“Just trying to be practical, huh?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam didn’t answer.</p><p>Dean had to look away from Sam. From the Sam-shaped thing standing next to him with nothing but calm, cold logic in those empty eyes. What difference did it make anyway? Why not have a whole team of enigmatic strangers whose motivations he didn’t completely trust? He had been kidding himself, thinking this job would be just like old times. That version of their lives was dead and buried in a thousand different graves.</p><p>“Fine,” Dean said. “She’s your responsibility. I want you on her day and night, watching her, but if you think something’s not right, you come to me. Come to me, you hear me? And I can’t believe I’m the one saying this, but I have to say it anyway. The day we start ganking innocent humans is the day we become what we’re hunting. Hell, you’re the one who taught me that. Remember?”</p><p>Dean could see that Sam was seriously thinking about what he was saying, but he had no way of knowing what was really going on inside that head.</p><p>“Go on,” Dean said with a resigned sigh. “Call her back in.”</p><p>Dean filled Sam and Xochi in on everything he’d learned from De La Paz. Sam, in turn, laid out the details of the more recent attack, including several grisly photos. The gory details didn’t seem to have any affect on Xochi’s appetite. She had finished the burrito and was powering her way through the remaining tortilla chips. She would dunk each chip into the salsa and then pour nearly an entire packet of salt onto every single bite. He’d never seen anyone eat so much salt in one meal. It was making him thirsty just watching her. Even though he still didn’t completely trust her, it was safe to say that she definitely wasn’t a demon.</p><p>“Interesting,” Xochi said. “But this information gives me more questions than answers.”</p><p>“Yeah, well speaking of questions,” Dean said. “It’s quid pro quo time. What’s a Borderwalker?”</p><p>“Do you have any beer?” Xochi asked.</p><p>Dean gestured grudgingly toward the dented mini fridge beside the television.</p><p>“Help yourself,” he said.</p><p>She sauntered across the room and bent over to pull a bottle of Negra Modelo out of the low fridge. Dean tried not to stare. Sam made no such effort.</p><p>“A Borderwalker is a creature that used to be human,” she said, popping the cap off her bottle and taking a swig. “Transformed by an ancient supernatural affliction that originated with a trick played on a mortal woman by the god Huehuecoyotl. He was smitten by a legendary beauty, so he tricked her into swallowing a lump of white copal that would make her fall in love with him. But the trick backfired and her love was so strong that she did not want him go back to the realm of the gods. She clung to him as he was shifting form to leave the realm of humans and her soul was caught in the portal, trapped in the borderland between the worlds. She became a shadow dweller, neither alive nor dead, lost between dreaming and waking, between beast and human. Like vampirism or your European lycanthropy, this affliction can be passed on to others, but only to women and only in the moments before their death. It’s known as the Coyote’s Kiss.”</p><p>Dean walked over to the fridge to grab a beer of his own. He motioned for her to continue.</p><p>“Borderwalkers are found only in the deepest desert,” she said. “And are generally very shy, rarely making contact with living humans. But they are attracted by dying women and will often make an offer to either guide their soul to the realm of the dead or pass on the legacy of the Coyote’s Kiss, allowing them to live on in dream form.”</p><p>“That’s a very nice bedtime story,” Dean said. “But you’re way off base. Whatever it is that attacked those Border Patrol officers certainly isn’t shy. It’s murdered at least twenty people that we know of.”</p><p>“Butchered them,” Sam said. “Tore them to pieces. This isn’t some mopey romantic ghost we’re dealing with. This thing is a bloodthirsty killer.”</p><p>“Isn’t that why we’re both here?” Xochi asked.</p><p>“I don’t follow,” Dean said.</p><p>“Aren’t you here because of the...” She paused, searching for the correct English word. “The wrongness? You are hunters, like me. Our job is to keep the balance, no?”</p><p>“Our job is to gank monsters,” Dean said.</p><p>“Now I don’t follow.” She looked genuinely puzzled. “You don’t dive into the river and slaughter a crocodile in her nest. She is a natural part of life and death in that river. She belongs there. You do not. But if that same crocodile comes into your swimming pool and eats your dog and your baby, she is no longer in her natural place. She has disrupted the balance and must be killed. That’s my job. It has been the job of my family for more than 500 years.</p><p>“Something is horribly wrong with this Borderwalker. She has become corrupted, her powers both intensified and twisted. I feel sure that understanding what happened on that night fifteen years ago is the key to understanding this tortured creature.”</p><p>“Okay, but hold on a second,” Sam said. “I’m still stuck on this.” He handed the photo of the halved SUV to Xochi. “What the hell happened here?”</p><p>Xochi took the photo, ran her finger over the image.</p><p>“Borderwalkers have the power to transport people and objects between worlds,” Xochi said. “In this case, it looks like our Borderwalker is so out of control that she is pulling things out of our world without intention. I believe that is also what happened to Davis Keene’s head.”</p><p>“Lovely,” Dean said.</p><p>“That kid Anibal,” Sam said. “The one who said he saw the border patrol officers turn a woman into a coyote. What do you make of that?”</p><p>“He may have seen her mortally wounded by the officers and then witnessed the appearance of the Borderwalker who turned her,” Xochi said. “That would explain her vendetta, but it doesn’t explain what went wrong in the transition.”</p><p>“Why wait for fifteen years?” Dean asked. “Why didn’t she come after these guys sooner?”</p><p>“In the Borderland between the worlds, where the transformation takes place, time passes differently. What seems like a single second can be a decade, or the other way around. There is no exact formula to it. Some take years. Some are instantaneous. Every transformation is different.”</p><p>“So how do we kill it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“A normal Borderwalker is a shape-shifter, able to take on aspects of various desert animals such as the coyote, the scorpion or the rattlesnake. But she is weakest in her human form. If we can find a way to connect emotionally with her human soul she will become vulnerable to attack with ordinary weapons.”</p><p>“That’s all you, Dean,” Sam said.</p><p>“Of course,” Xochi said. “That’s a normal Borderwalker. A normal Borderwalker cannot tear through a bulletproof vest. A normal Borderwalker would have no reason to even attempt such a thing. This creature that we are dealing with is driven by a kind of all-consuming rage. Her vendetta has transformed her into something unnatural. Something terrible. There is no precedent. I think it would be wise to assume there are no rules.”</p><p>“What about silver?” Dean asked. “Works against most other shifters.”</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “It does, but not against Borderwalkers. It will not kill her if used as a weapon, but may thwart her attack if worn for protection. Obsidian, perhaps, would be more effective...” She trailed off, seeming lost in reflection for a moment.</p><p>“Is there some kind of herb we could use?” Sam suggested. “The Borderwalker equivalent to wolfsbane or garlic? You mentioned something about copal. That’s a kind of tree resin, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Borderwalkers have copal smoke for blood,” Xochi said. “And copal is often burned to help lost souls find their way back home on the Day of the Dead. But I don’t think it would give us any advantage against her. However, Cempoalxochitl... how do you say... marigold? These flowers are very powerful and may offer us some additional protection.”</p><p>“Marigolds?” Dean raised an eyebrow. “You mean those little orange puffballs in old ladies’ window boxes?”</p><p>“Marigolds are the most sacred plant of my people,” Xochi said with a thundery frown. “I wear them in my hair whenever I go into battle.”</p><p>“No disrespect to your people,” Dean said. “But we’re not going to San Francisco here. I ain’t wearing any flowers in my hair.”</p><p>“I’m with Dean on this,” Sam said. “I wouldn’t even let them put a lei on me if I went to Hawaii.”</p><p>“No problem,” she said, shrugging. “I’m sure your big fat cojones will be more than enough to protect you.”</p><p>“So what’s the plan then?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We need to talk to the two remaining men,” Dean said. “Find out what really happened that night. Maybe warn them, if they’ll listen. Then stake them out and wait for our Borderwalker to show up.”</p><p>“So, what?” Sam said. “We should split up? Each take one guy?”</p><p>“No,” Xochi said firmly. “We stay together. It’s the only way.”</p><p>“What makes you say that?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Listen,” she said, throwing a loaded gaze in Dean’s direction, then turning and putting her hand in the center of Sam’s chest. “I need you.”</p><p>Sam grinned. “Anytime, baby.”</p><p>“Not for that,” she said. She looked up into Sam’s eyes, searching. “I need you because of your... dislocated soul. The motivations of your gods are hidden from me, but I know that you are here for a reason.”</p><p>“Hold on a minute,” Dean said. “What do you know about his soul?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she said. “Only that it is missing from his body. And that without him, this hunt will ultimately fail. We need to work together to fight this thing. It’s the only way.”</p><p>“Okay, so you need him,” Dean said. “But why do we need you?”</p><p>Xochi looked him over.</p><p>“¿Hablas Español?”</p><p>“Mas cerveza por favor,” Dean said with a sheepish half-smile. “That’s pretty much it.”</p><p>She turned to Sam. “You?”</p><p>“I remember some of my high school Spanish,” Sam said. “I can get my point across when I need to.”</p><p>“What if our Borderwalker chooses to move south? You are familiar with the towns on the other side of the border? Nogales? Agua Prieta? Cuidad Juarez?”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. They both shook their heads.</p><p>“These are some of the most dangerous places in my country,” she said. “I’m sure you’ve seen the news. The gruesome executions. Torture. Women and children gunned down in the street. There is open war between the drug cartels, but I’m sure they will be happy to stop shooting each other long enough to give directions to a couple of lost gringos.”</p><p>“Point taken,” Dean said. “But what makes you think we won’t catch it here on this side of the border?”</p><p>“Maybe we will,” she said. “Or maybe we won’t. You like to gamble, Dean? I do not.”</p><p>“So we stay together,” Dean said. “But how do we know who to visit first?”</p><p>“I will go into the desert,” Xochi said. “Pray to Huehuecoyotl and ask him to help us find his wayward granddaughter. His answers are not always trustworthy, but his lies often reveal more than the truth.”</p><p>“I’ll work on tracking down current addresses for the two men,” Sam said. “And any other information I can dig up on the recent killings in San Diego.”</p><p>Dean nodded, pushed his fingers through his hair. He wasn’t exactly happy with this uneasy alliance, but it seemed almost like it could work.</p><p>“I must go now,” Xochi said. “But I will return in the morning.”</p><p>She walked over to Sam, stood high on her booted toes and pulled his shaggy head down so she could kiss his cheek.</p><p>“Thank you for the food,” she said.</p><p>“De nada,” Sam said with a wink.</p><p>She turned and locked eyes with Dean. She came to him slow and slid her arms around him, curvy little body pressed against his like it had been when she was struggling under him on the scratchy carpet.</p><p>“And thank you, Dean,” she said, low and close to his ear. “For giving me a chance to prove my intentions.”</p><p>Dean gripped her by the upper arms and stepped back, out of her embrace.</p><p>“Yeah, okay great.” he said. “See you tomorrow.”</p><p>She paused for a moment, looking up into his eyes.</p><p>“Tomorrow,” she said.</p><p>She turned and left. Dean closed the door and locked it. Let out a breath he hadn’t realized he was holding.</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Dude,” Sam said. “What’s with you?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“That chick’s a hammer. I’ll bet she could crack walnuts with that ass.”</p><p>“Yeah, so?”</p><p>“So she’s obviously into you,” Sam said. “You ought to hit that while it’s hot.”</p><p>Dean went for a much-needed drink, bypassing the beer and going straight to the whisky he’d stashed in the bedside drawer beside the King James Bible.</p><p>“Come on,” he said, breaking the seal and swigging directly from the bottle. “We’ve got more important things to think about right now.”</p><p>“You’re the one who keeps on saying you don’t believe I’m really me,” Sam said, hands held out in exaggerated disbelief. “But who the hell are you? My big brother, the unrepentant womanizer, just let an ass like that walk out the door because he’s got more important things to think about?”</p><p>“Look, if you think she’s so hot, why don’t you...:”</p><p>Sam cut him off before he could finish.</p><p>“Why are you still doing this to yourself?”</p><p>“Doing what, exactly?”</p><p>“Not like it matters to me one way or the other, but you and Lisa have been separated for how long now?”</p><p>“You were the one who wanted me to be with her so badly in the first place,” Dean said. “Besides, I’m just...”</p><p>“Just what?” Sam said. “Just not getting any. That’s what. Look, you gave the whole apple pie thing a shot, but it didn’t work out. Moping around and acting like there aren’t any other women in the world isn’t gonna change that. You need to lighten up. Have a little harmless fun. Clear out your pipes, because they’re obviously starting to back up and overflow into your brain.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Dean took another swig. “If you had a soul, maybe you’d understand.”</p><p>“You really think she hasn’t been with anyone else since you left?”</p><p>Dean turned to face his brother, eyes narrow.</p><p>“I really think you oughta mind your own damn business,” Dean said. He set the bottle down hard on the table, contents sloshing, nearly spilling.</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Sam said, shrugging. Unruffled as a reptile.</p><p>“Well don’t,” Dean said, hands curling into fists.</p><p>He was itching to let Sam have it, but there was no point. He was right, of course. Just trying to be practical. Besides, it wasn’t as if the idea hadn’t crossed Dean’s mind before. More times than he wanted to admit. Even though it made him crazy to think of anyone else touching Lisa, she deserved to find someone who could keep her safe and make her happy. Someone stable and decent and honest. Someone who could be a good role model for Ben. Someone who would never expose them to the kind of ugliness that Dean had brought into their lives. In short, someone who wasn’t him.</p><p>So why couldn’t he let go? Lighten up? Have a little harmless fun?</p><p>He grabbed the bottle by the neck and walked out the motel door.</p><p>Dean sat behind the wheel of the Impala, staring through the bug-splattered windshield at the motel parking lot. That car had always been more of a home to him than any house or any town anywhere in the country. It was where he went whenever he felt rocky. Disconnected. But sitting there that night, he just couldn’t shake the feeling of emotional freefall. Like he’d completely lost sight of what he was supposed to be doing with his life. Sam’s question was still echoing inside his head. Who the hell are you? Dean couldn’t make things work with Lisa, but he couldn’t just go back to who he used to be either. All he could do was keep busy, keep moving, and keep all his emotions crushed down and buried deep, like he always did. Numb up and nut up. Lose himself in the hunt. But it was the quiet times like this that got to him. Those long, lonely hours when night became morning, when no matter how much he drank, he just couldn’t seem to drown all the doubt and regret. The bottle propped between his legs was half empty. The pessimists’ verdict. Half empty, like he was. He took another pull, swiftly working his way toward completely empty. He thought of De La Paz, asking him if he still believed in justice.</p><p>When he first came out to the car, he had this absurd hope that Xochi would still be there, silently waiting astride her Hayabusa. He’d gotten into his head that if he saw her, he’d give her what she wanted. In spades. Toss her in the back seat of the Impala and prove to her that he wasn’t so hung up on the past he couldn’t have a little harmless fun. Prove it to himself. But she wasn’t there. So he sat in the car alone, drinking himself maudlin. Still hung up on the past.</p><p>He took out his cell phone. Lisa’s number remained on the screen from the previous dozen times he’d looked at it but didn’t dial it. He stared at it until the little screen went dark to conserve power, then put the phone back in his pocket.</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi had parked the Hayabusa beside a dying Joshua tree and hiked off into the desert. She had nothing with her but a thin bedroll, a canteen and a small pouch containing sacred tools and herbs. She had a flashlight, but didn’t use it. She didn’t need it. Her night vision was sharp as a cat’s, but she wasn’t following a visible path. She was following ley lines. Veins of psychic energy that flow like blood just beneath the skin of the world. Leading her to a powerful nexus point where her prayer to Huehuecoyotl would be most likely to be heard.</p><p>The sky above her was cloudless, a heavy three-quarter moon low on the horizon. She searched the scatter of stars for the Tianquiztli cluster out of childhood habit, feeling reassured and centered when she found it. She could hear the frantic, high-pitched yipping of coyotes in the distance.</p><p>The harsh, moonlit landscape gave no indication that humans had ever existed and seemed to actively resent her presence. The slithering sand filled in her footprints seconds after she made them.</p><p>It took several hours for her to reach the nexus. As she walked, she thought of the two big green-eyed gringos. So infuriatingly American in their approach, all cowboy muscle and cocky, self-centered entitlement, yet she could clearly see that their destinies were inextricably intertwined with her own.</p><p>The older brother was going to be a problem, but he was a problem that intrigued her. Sure, he was distractingly handsome, a ripe mango, and she couldn’t deny a certain raw physical attraction. But there was so much more going on under the surface. He was complicated, a haunted warrior. She knew she couldn’t just break into a man like that the way she’d broken into his cheap motel room. She needed to find a way to earn his trust, and cheap seduction was not the way to do it.</p><p>As for the younger, soulless brother, she knew from the first second she saw him that he was the key. But why couldn’t she see the shape of the lock?</p><p>The area around the nexus was no different visually than the hundreds of miles of surrounding desert. A slight indentation in the sand, to the left of a pair of large squarish boulders like dice thrown by bored gods. To the right, a thick stand of spindly creosote, an impossibly long-lived desert dweller that was already ancient back when the great city of Tenochtitlan was still young.</p><p>She unrolled her striped woolen blanket near the center of the indentation and started gathering kindling for a small fire. Once she’d collected enough, she dug a shallow pit, ringed it with smooth stones and stacked the gathered branches in a loose basket shape with the smallest underneath and the thickest at the top. She tucked a handful of dried leaves under the kindling and lit them with a silver Zippo. She was an old-fashioned girl, but not above modern convenience.</p><p>Once she got the fire started, she began to lay out ritual tools on the blanket. Bundles of herbs. A chunk of turquoise. A wooden cup. A pale flint knife with a handle shaped like a coiled snake.</p><p>She started with a spiritual cleansing, bathing her body in sage smoke and releasing all worldly thoughts from her mind. She mixed several of the dried herbs in the wooden cup, crushing them with the turquoise and then adding water from her canteen. The resulting brew was bitter and earthy, but she drank it down without hesitation. It left flecks of grit on her lips and tongue.</p><p>After throwing a handful of copal into the fire, she took the blade of the knife and held it to her sternum. It felt cold against her skin. Pulling in a slow, centering breath, she drew the razor-sharp stone blade across the tattooed heart on her chest. She clenched her teeth, hissing against the sting. Her blood gathered on the blade and she held it over the fire, letting fat droplets fall sizzling into the flames. A symbolic sacrifice to Huehuecoyotl.</p><p>“Let me be open,” she said, speaking in her ancient native tongue.</p><p>Then she waited.</p><p>It started with the coyotes. First one, then three, leggy gray shadows lurking around the perimeter of her vision. Soon more than a dozen, silently watching. Waiting, like she was. She was not afraid.</p><p>When Huehuecoyotl came, his form was human, a diminutive old man, as gnarled and brown as dried venison. Naked except for a tattered blanket clutched around his hunched and bony shoulders. But his eyes were young, dancing with wicked humor.</p><p>“Little Xiuhxochitl,” he said, calling her by her full name.</p><p>“Huehuetque,” Xochi replied, respectfully addressing him using the term for a wise elder. “You honor this humble huntress with your presence.”</p><p>“You are a woman now,” he said, his face flickering from canine to human and back again in the orange glow of her dying fire. “A shadow warrior, like your mother. The flower blooms.”</p><p>He held out his knobby brown hand, cupping a lick of fire in his palm. He swirled a fingertip though the captive flame and it began to coil itself into petals. When he handed it to her, it had become a flower, a lush yellow dahlia. After a few heartbeats, the flower became a fat horned lizard, regarding her with a cocked head and suspicious little eyes. When she moved her hand to put the lizard down, it shot angry jets of blood from its eyes, leaping away and leaving her arm streaked with crimson.</p><p>Huehuecoyotl laughed, flashing toothless gums and slapping his skinny shank like that was the funniest thing he’d ever seen. Xochi was familiar with his childish pranks and kept her cool, trying to stay focused on the matter at hand.</p><p>“I need your advice, Huehuetque,” Xochi said.</p><p>“What will you give me in return?” he asked. “A kiss?”</p><p>He was no longer a scrawny old man. In the swift flicker of a shadow, he’d become Dean Winchester. Still nude, his tattered blanket now thrown back off one muscular shoulder. Xochi looked away, focusing her gaze on the heart of the fire.</p><p>“A kiss is what started this trouble,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Trouble is what makes eternity worth enduring,” he replied.</p><p>“Not this kind of trouble.” Xochi raised her head to meet his gaze. “This isn’t a joke. People are dying.”</p><p>“Child,” he said. “Your people are always dying. That’s what makes you human.”</p><p>“But even you must sense the wrongness of these events. It’s unnatural. Balance must be restored.”</p><p>“Must it?”</p><p>He was no longer Dean. Now he was a giant black coyote, standing on its hind legs and towering over her with a disturbingly human posture. But he still had Dean’s green eyes.</p><p>“This world lost all sense of balance hundreds of years ago,” he said. “It was lost when the greedy priests of Tenochtitlan started using their sacrificial rituals for political and personal gain. You and your family are backward artifacts of a lost age. Adhering to principles that mean nothing in this modern world of unchecked chaos and destruction. Your mother knew this. That is why she took her own life.”</p><p>“Your lies can’t hurt me,” Xochi said. “My mother died in battle. The death of an honored warrior.”</p><p>“Your mother gave up. She couldn’t face her own obsolescence.”</p><p>He’d shifted again, this time taking the form of her mother. The intimidating, barely remembered beauty who’d never held Xochi. Never tucked her in at night and soothed her fears. Who’d always been too busy hunting to bother with mundane things like birthdays or skinned knees. Who was gone before Xochi was old enough to hold a knife.</p><p>“With respect, Huehuetque,” Xochi said, struggling to keep her voice level. She couldn’t let him get to her. “I did not call you here tonight to talk about my family. I want to talk about your family. This Borderwalker is your own spiritual granddaughter. She has become corrupted, lost in hate and fear. Help me find her and take away her pain.”</p><p>“You must go home to find her.” He was an old man again. “Go home, huntress. This is not about my family.”</p><p>Xochi studied him, trying to squint through the smoke of lies and catch a glimpse of the truth.</p><p>“Does she bite with coyote’s teeth?” he asked. “Or is she driven by the wind of beating wings?”</p><p>“I don’t understand...?”</p><p>“She is just the song. Ask yourself, who is singing?”</p><p>Then he was gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Whoever was banging on the motel door needed to die. It felt like they were banging directly on the inside of Dean’s skull.</p><p>“Up and at ‘em, Sunshine,” Sam said, whipping the covers off Dean’s aching head. “Your girlfriend is here.”</p><p>“Tell her I’m indisposed,” Dean groaned.</p><p>“Tell her yourself,” Sam said, throwing the motel door wide open and letting in a vicious blast of sunlight like napalm.</p><p>“Aw, man!” Dean said, pulling the covers back over his face.</p><p>“Good morning, Sam,” Xochi said. “Dean. I brought some presents for you two boys.”</p><p>“You should give them to me,” Sam said. “Dean’s been naughty.”</p><p>“Close the damn door, will ya?” Dean said from under the thin motel bedspread.</p><p>Once the evil sun had been banished from the room, Dean peeled open his dry sticky eyes and peered out from under the covers. The first two knuckles on his right hand were scabbed and sore. Did he get into a fight the night before? He certainly felt like he’d gotten his ass kicked.</p><p>Dean had a vague recollection of killing the bottle of whisky, then making the brilliant decision to stagger over to the bar across the road from the motel. He remembered trying to pick up a woman who didn’t speak English and failing miserably. He remembered kicking a juke box that only played “Amor Prohibido” by Selena over and over no matter what songs he picked. After that, nothing.</p><p>When he looked up, he saw Xochi standing by the door, still dressed in the same clothes as the night before. She had a large, padded olive-green rifle bag slung over her shoulder and that same look of arch amusement in her eyes.</p><p>Dean sat up gingerly, put his sock-clad feet on the carpet and his aching head in his hands, running his fingers through his hair. He noticed that he was still dressed in last night’s clothes too.</p><p>“Give me one of those bottles of water,” Dean said. “My mouth tastes like demon ass.”</p><p>“You’d know,” Sam replied, tossing Dean the bottle.</p><p>Dean cracked open the water and hit it hard, downing more than half in one swallow.</p><p>“Well, do you want your presents or don’t you?” Xochi asked.</p><p>She handed the rifle bag to Sam.</p><p>“What the hell do you have in here?” Sam asked, weighing the bag in his hand, surprised by its weight. “Gold bars?”</p><p>“A hundred pounds of aspirin?” Dean asked. “That’d just about do it.”</p><p>“Open it,” she said.</p><p>Sam unzipped the bag and removed what looked at first like a baseball bat. But it was wider and flattened out, the wood darker. It took a second for Dean’s sluggish brain to process what it really was. There were several wickedly sharp, obsidian blades set into the edges of the bat in matched pairs, eight on each side, like a frozen chainsaw.</p><p>“This is Maquahuitl,” Xochi stated.</p><p>“Mack what?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Maquahuitl,” she said again. Dean didn’t feel any closer to being able to repeat that word than he had been when she first said it. “You can strike with the flat sides or cut with the sharp. In our case, you will want to cut. Edged weapons will inflict more damage to our Borderwalker than bullets and obsidian will be more effective than silver or steel. It is no guarantee, but it is better than empty hands.”</p><p>Sam swung the bat appreciatively.</p><p>“Nice,” he said. “There’s one here for you too, Dean.”</p><p>“And I have another gift,” Xochi said. “Outside.”</p><p>“This one is aspirin, right?”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“A witness,” she said.</p><p>She opened the door and walked out into the parking lot. Sam set the strange weapon on the table with a weighty clunk and went after her. Dean got himself upright, shoved his feet into his unlaced boots and reluctantly followed them out into the bright morning. The mindlessly beautiful day seemed like a personal affront to his current condition.</p><p>There was another rider sitting on the back of Xochi’s Hayabusa. Helmet on, hands behind his back. It wasn’t until Dean got closer that he realized that the man’s hands were handcuffed to a bolt set into the frame of the bike.</p><p>Xochi pulled the helmet off his head, revealing a chinless, unshaven face and large, bulging eyes. One of them was blackened, swollen shut. He was gagged with a red bandana.</p><p>“I want you to meet my friend Ojon,” she said, pulling out a ring of keys and unlocking the cuffs. “Watch him. He’s a runner.”</p><p>Sam stepped up and took Ojon by the wiry arm, helping him down off the bike.</p><p>“Ojon was there the night of the first murders,” she said. “He’s seen our Borderwalker in action and he’s anxious to tell us all about it.”</p><p>Ojon was jittery, twitching like he was about to crawl out of his skin. His shirt was soaked with foul-smelling amphetamine sweat. His one good eye pinballed around the parking lot like he was trying to watch every angle at once. Like he was sure the Borderwalker was about to show up and eat his face.</p><p>Dean stepped up and took Ojon’s other arm and he and Sam tossed their witness into the motel room like bouncers giving him the bum’s rush in reverse. Xochi followed close behind, closing and locking the motel room door.</p><p>Ojon got up off his knees, untied the gag and pulled it out of his mouth. The second Xochi stepped away from the door he sprinted across the room and grabbed the door knob, frantically yanking and twisting. The lock was about an inch up from the knob and if he wasn’t so fixated on the doorknob, he could have just unlocked it and run.</p><p>Dean traded disbelieving looks with Sam and Xochi.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” Dean finally said, stepping up and putting his hand over Ojon’s. “Take it easy there, genius. We’re not gonna hurt you.”</p><p>“Keep her away from me,” he said, turning and flattening himself out against the door. His voice was high and reedy, his accent thick.</p><p>“I’ll try,” Dean said, leaning in close and dropping his voice. “But, between you and me... Well I’m sure you’ve seen Q.”</p><p>He looked at Dean like he’d just stepped off a flying saucer. Sam swallowed a snorting half-laugh.</p><p>“Come on, Ojon,” Dean said. “Relax. Have a seat. We just want to ask you a few questions.”</p><p>Ojon gave Dean a wary look, then scuttled over and sat on the corner of Sam’s unused bed, as far away from Xochi as he could be while still remaining in the same room.</p><p>“I’d offer you a drink,” Dean said. “But I don’t think there are any alcoholic beverages left in this county after last night.”</p><p>“I don’t know nothing,” he said, hands battling in his lap like he was a kid making invisible action figures fight.</p><p>“Just tell us what you saw that night,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Nothing,” he said again.</p><p>Xochi spoke to him in Spanish, her tone both intimate and menacing.</p><p>“A woman,” he said. “I saw a woman.”</p><p>“What did she look like?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Pretty at first.” He looked up at Sam, then away. “Then...” He shrugged. “Not so pretty.”</p><p>“Look, we’re not paying by the hour here,” Dean said. “Get on with it.”</p><p>“You pay?” Ojon looked suddenly hopeful.</p><p>Xochi hissed in Spanish and took a step closer to him, gloved hand raised.</p><p>“Okay, okay!” Ojon threw both hands up, shoulders hunched up to his ears. “I see a woman. She is pretty, with light skin and curly black hair. This CBP guy, he look to her and he know her. He know her. Then she change. She change to a monster. Like... like...”</p><p>He turned to Xochi and said something in Spanish.</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Something about scorpions?” Sam said.</p><p>Xochi nodded. “He says the woman became a hole full of scorpion tails.”</p><p>“Charming,” Dean said. “Can’t wait to meet her.”</p><p>“Tell us what happened to the SUV,” Sam said.</p><p>“I no look. I run,” Ojon said. His gaze stayed locked on his hands.</p><p>“Is there anything else you can tell us about her?” Dean asked. “Anything at all?”</p><p>“She... she had a tattoo.”</p><p>“A tattoo?”</p><p>“Yes, a tattoo. On her neck. Una mariposa.”</p><p>“A butterfly?” Sam said, looking to Xochi for confirmation.</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “Sam, make sure you write that down.” He turned to Xochi. “Look, he’s not telling us anything we don’t already know. I don’t think we’re gonna get anything useful out of this speed freak.”</p><p>“One more thing,” Xochi said. “I want his blood. For divination.”</p><p>That sent him flying over to the door again. This time he realized he could unlock it and was halfway out before Sam grabbed him around the waist and dragged him back in. He was flailing and kicking, shrieking like a howler monkey. Dean kicked the door closed and picked up the soggy gag, stuffing it back into Ojon’s mouth.</p><p>Despite his flyweight physique, it took all of both Sam and Dean’s combined muscle to hold Ojon down. His skin was moist and clammy and he stank, like bad teeth and burnt plastic. Xochi pulled out a stone knife with a handle shaped like a snake and pressed the blade to his dirty neck.</p><p>“You’re not gonna kill him, are you?” Dean asked out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“As much as I might like to,” Xochi said. “No. I only need a small amount of his blood.”</p><p>“She’s right,” Sam said. “If he was that close to our creature when she opened the doorway between the worlds, some residual bad mojo is probably still clinging to him. A divination using his tainted blood could point to where she’s headed.”</p><p>“Tainted blood?” Dean said. “This guy’s blood is so tainted we could sell it to truckers to help them stay awake.”</p><p>Xochi’s gloved hands were steady as surgeon’s as she nicked Ojon’s throat with the knife, collecting his blood on the flat edge of the blade. She then picked up the cap from Dean’s empty water bottle and let the blood run into it from the tip of the blade.</p><p>“Let him go,” Xochi said. “We have no more use for him.”</p><p>Sam and Dean eased up on Ojon. He eyed them both like it was some kind of trick.</p><p>“You heard her, slick,” Dean said. “You’re free to go.”</p><p>Ojon didn’t bother to remove the gag. He just bolted for the door, threw it open and ran out into the parking lot, where he tripped over his own big feet and ate asphalt about three feet away from Xochi’s bike.</p><p>Dean closed the door, shaking his head.</p><p>“Write the names of the two men,” Xochi said to Sam.</p><p>Sam tore a page from his notebook and did as she requested, setting the sheet of paper on the carpet at her feet. She knelt with the cap in one hand and the knife in the other. She spoke some words that Dean was pretty sure weren’t Spanish and the blood inside the cap began to swirl like a miniature maelstrom. When she up-ended the cap onto the center of the page, the blood ran toward one of the names as if the paper were slanted in that direction. Crimson tendrils flowed around the name, obliterating it.</p><p>BREWER</p><p>“There’s your answer,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “Brewer’s in Yuma. We’d better hit the road.”</p><p>Xochi stood, sheathing the knife.</p><p>“Before we leave,” Xochi said. “May I wash myself?”</p><p>“Uh yeah,” Dean said. “No problem. Be my guest.”</p><p>“You’d better wash yourself too,” Sam said to Dean. “I’m not gonna sit in a car for four hours with a guy who smells like a dirty bar rag.”</p><p>“Ladies first,” Dean said, gesturing toward the closed bathroom door.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said. She paused with her hand on the doorknob. “But Dean, I have one question. What is Q?”</p><p>“Look,” Dean said, suppressing a snicker. “You can’t be in the Monster Club if you haven’t seen Q, The Winged Serpent.”</p><p>“It’s a movie,” Sam said. “And you’re probably better off not having seen it.”</p><p>“Winged serpent?” She frowned. “They made a movie about Quetzalcoatl?”</p><p>“They made a movie about a cheesy rubber puppet flying around New York City and eating people,” Sam told her.</p><p>“Aw, come on,” Dean said. “I love that movie.”</p><p>“Dude,” Sam said. “We watched that movie when I was, like, five years old, and even back then I wasn’t buying that monster for a minute.”</p><p>“You help me win this fight,” Xochi said with a wink. “I’ll introduce you to the real thing. Then can I be in the Monster Club?”</p><p>“If we win this,” Sam said. “You’re in. Lifetime membership.”</p><p>Xochi smiled and disappeared into the bathroom.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The three of them stood outside a greasy spoon diner. It was long and narrow, a fifties aluminum building that had been given an ugly brown-and-orange makeover sometime in the mid seventies. There was a Denny’s on the other side of the highway, and so the little diner was nearly empty. The faded and peeling sign above the door read “ROADRUNNER GRILL” and featured a slightly altered knock-off of the famous cartoon character who was always making a fool out of the coyote. Dean found that strangely appropriate.</p><p>It was only 9 a.m. but rapidly becoming unbearably hot. Xochi had traded her black wifebeater tank top for a white one, making her lack of a bra even more evident. Her long hair was loose and fragrant, still damp from the shower. She wore the same beat-up, Mad Max leather pants. And her gun-belt.</p><p>“You know, I’m as paranoid as the next hunter,” Dean said, gesturing at the pistols. “But are you sure it’s a good idea to wear those to breakfast? I really don’t think anybody’s gonna try to shoot you in a diner.”</p><p>“I have a carry permit,” Xochi said. “Your country is very gun-friendly.”</p><p>“But you aren’t even a U.S. citizen,” Sam said. “Are you?”</p><p>“No,” Xochi said. “In fact, this is my first time visiting the United States. But I have a U.S. driver’s license. And a birth certificate that says I was born in Los Angeles. A lot of people owe me favors.”</p><p>“Come on, kids,” Sam said, pushing the diner door open and motioning for Xochi to enter.</p><p>The single waitress, a tiny, birdlike woman in her mid-fifties with a big, bright red, utterly unironic eighties poodle perm, motioned for them to seat themselves. She eyed Xochi’s guns but was smart enough not to say anything. Sam and Dean took opposite sides of the orange Naugahyde booth closest to the door. Xochi chose to sit beside Sam. Dean had no idea why that bothered him so much, and tried to concentrate on the menu instead. A big greasy breakfast was just the ticket to get on top of his lingering hangover.</p><p>“So how was your powwow with the coyote guy last night?” Sam asked Xochi. “Anything useful?”</p><p>“Huehuecoyotl is a trickster,” Xochi said, looking down at the menu. “It is hard to see through his lies. He told me I had to go back to Mexico City to find the Borderwalker, but the divination proves that she is going after Brewer in Yuma next.” She closed the menu and slid it over to the edge of the table. “He did say one thing that I think may be significant. He seemed to be hinting that a larger force is behind the actions of the Borderwalker. If that is the case, we may have a much more difficult fight on our hands.”</p><p>The waitress came over to fill their coffee cups and take their orders. Xochi asked for a bacon cheeseburger with extra bacon.</p><p>“And chili cheese fries,” she looked to Sam. “We can share, okay?”</p><p>“Chili cheese fries, for breakfast?” Sam shook his head. “Dean, you may have finally met your perfect woman.”</p><p>“Chili cheese fries sound fantastic,” Dean said. “Just what the doctor ordered. And I’ll have a bacon cheeseburger too.”</p><p>“You can’t fight the forces of darkness with a stomach full of salad,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Amen, sister,” Dean said, raising his coffee cup.</p><p>Sam rolled his eyes. “You can’t fight anything if you’re dead from a heart attack.”</p><p>“You really think people like us live long enough to die from a heart attack?” Xochi asked.</p><p>There was a beat of awkward silence at the table.</p><p>“Okay, and what can I get you, honey,” the waitress asked Sam, with a desperately forced smile.</p><p>Xochi followed the Impala on her bike. Dean watched her in the rearview, wondering what the hell he’d been thinking, agreeing to let her tag along. Wondering what it would be like with her.</p><p>“Turn here,” Sam said. “Here!”</p><p>Dean swung the Impala into a squealing, last-minute swerve to hit the turnoff Sam had indicated. Xochi followed smoothly behind them.</p><p>Gilberto Brewer was a vet, a marine with a couple tours in the Middle East before he came home and joined the CBP, and so Sam had been able to pull all kinds of info about him through Veteran Services. Never married. No living family. History of drug addiction and homelessness over the past fifteen years, on and off a county-run methadone program. Mostly off. Currently living in a crap apartment on the outskirts of Yuma.</p><p>It took them a few trips around the block to find the place, and then only by inferring the address based on the numbers on the adjacent buildings. It was as if people who lived there didn’t want to be found. Once Dean got a good look at the place, he decided he couldn’t blame them.</p><p>It was a dump, cheaply built in the eighties and already falling apart. Scabby stucco. Barred windows. There were only six units, all in a row like a cheap motel. Letters instead of numbers. Brewer was in the last one. End of the line, apartment F. That was about right.</p><p>Xochi pulled into the parking lot behind them. She removed her helmet and started twining her hair up into a big figure eight on the top of her head, fastening it with long pins and marigolds just like she said she would. The resulting crown of flowers looked weirdly incongruous with the rest of her scrappy un-feminine outfit.</p><p>“Here,” she said, pulling handfuls of thick silver chains out of her backpack. “Put these on. If you won’t wear marigolds, at least these may give you some protection around your face and neck.”</p><p>Dean slipped the tangled chains over his head.</p><p>“I feel like the second-place Mr. T,” he said.</p><p>“Just tuck ‘em under your shirt,” Sam said, putting on his own chains and slipping them under his collar.</p><p>“Bring the weapons I gave you,” Xochi said. “Be ready.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Sam said. “I think this guy’s gonna freak out if we walk in there holding spiked baseball bats.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that,” she said.</p><p>“What about you?” Dean asked Xochi. “What are you planning to use to fight the Borderwalker? Harsh language?”</p><p>“Exactly,” she said, turning away and heading for the door to Brewer’s apartment.</p><p>“Well isn’t she a take-charge kinda girl?” Dean muttered, annoyed by how easily they’d both fallen into following her lead.</p><p>“She can take charge of me any day,” Sam replied, hefting the rifle bag and slinging it over one shoulder.</p><p>When the two of them got to the door, Xochi was already banging on it with her gloved fist.</p><p>“So,” Dean said. “Is there a plan... or...”</p><p>The door opened a crack, revealing a chain lock and a slice of pale, unshaven face. A single suspicious bloodshot eye looked them over.</p><p>“What do you want?”</p><p>Xochi kicked the door open, breaking the chain off its track.</p><p>Dean and Sam exchanged glances, then shrugged and followed her into the apartment.</p><p>It was dim and cavelike inside, with a smell like old socks and moldy carpet. It was pretty much all one claustrophobic room with a minimal kitchen off one side and bathroom off the other. The walls were a dingy, unpleasant peach, like the skin of a discarded doll. The furniture was a sorry cluster of mismatched thrift store refugees. No television. No computer. No stereo. No books. No visible source of entertainment of any kind, unless you counted the dope paraphernalia on the scarred coffee table.</p><p>Brewer was Latino, mid-forties, and balding, with pale, jaundiced skin and the sad, deflated build of a former bodybuilder gone to seed. He was dressed in a thin T-shirt that hadn’t been white in years and cheap, shiny track pants. There was an ugly purple abscess in the crook of his left arm.</p><p>In moments, Xochi had Brewer backed up against the wall, a fistful of his stained T-shirt in one hand and a pistol in the other. She jammed the business end of the gun up under Brewer’s chin and whispered to him in Spanish.</p><p>Dean stepped up beside her and put his hand on her shoulder, flashing Brewer a friendly reassuring smile.</p><p>“You’ll have to forgive my partner, Mr. Brewer,” Dean said, badging him with an FBI ID. “She’s very... enthusiastic.”</p><p>Xochi backed off with the gun and let go of Brewer’s shirt, but stayed up in his face, letting him know that she might change her mind at any moment. Playing unhinged bad-cop counterpoint to Dean’s calm, trustworthy good cop like they’d been doing it their whole lives, Sam stood like a silent wall behind them, arms crossed and using his size to intimidate and block access to the door. Maybe not exactly the way Dean would have played it, but it looked like they had this.</p><p>“I’m Special Agent Scott. My partners Young...” Chin tip to Sam. “And Quintanilla.” To Xochi. “We need to talk to you.”</p><p>Brewer’s eyes flicked to the syringe on the table, then back to Dean.</p><p>“Not about that,” Dean said. “About an incident that occurred on the night of April 18th 1995.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” the man croaked. But Brewer’s expression told a different story. It said that he knew exactly what they were talking about.</p><p>“Look, Brewer,” Dean said. “We can do this the hard way, if you prefer.”</p><p>“Mr. Brewer,” Xochi interrupted. “Excuse me, Mr. Brewer.”</p><p>Dean shot her a questioning glance but she ignored him.</p><p>“What?” Brewer wiped his dry lips with a nervous, shaking hand.</p><p>“Do you have someone else living here with you?” Xochi asked.</p><p>Brewer frowned, gave a terse shake of his head.</p><p>Xochi stepped back, gestured with her gun.</p><p>“Then who is that?”</p><p>Dean followed her gaze through the doorway to the grungy bathroom. There was someone sitting on the edge of the bathtub, facing away from them. Silent, unmoving. Someone with curly black hair.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>For a moment, nothing happened. The four of them stood frozen, just watching and waiting. Xochi felt the familiar adrenaline rush coursing through her limbs as she let her breath out slow and relaxed her muscles, preparing her body for action. Then Dean leaned close and spoke low out of the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“That her?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I think so, yes,” Xochi replied.</p><p>Sam reached into the unzipped rifle bag and pulled out one of the obsidian-studded maquahuitl, moving slow and never taking his eyes off the woman in the bathroom.</p><p>Then the woman’s head whipped around and she screamed, face splitting open into a bloody, gaping hole ringed with canine teeth. Blowtorch rage blasted Xochi with a power that was nearly physical in its intensity, but she stepped forward rather than back, shoving Brewer behind her and raising her right hand.</p><p>The Borderwalker stood. Sam tossed the maquahuitl to Dean and then pulled the other from the rifle bag. The brothers flanked her, Dean on her right and Sam on her left. Brewer cowered behind them.</p><p>When Xochi spoke the first word of the spell that would bind the Borderwalker and drive her back, the creature abruptly fell forward onto her belly. When she hit the bathroom tile, her body seemed to shatter into a hundred black fragments. Xochi was horrified when she realized the fragments were alive. Hoards of black tarantulas were swarming around her boots, heading for Brewer.</p><p>The boys were swearing and stomping their feet. Brewer was crouched up against the wall, arms thrown defensively across his face. Xochi spun and held her ground, continued reciting the spell.</p><p>The army of hairy arachnid bodies puddled like tar and then in a stutter-flash, reformed into a kind of jittery, roadkill marionette, dripping with maggots. As quickly as her brain could register this new shape, the creature shifted again, now more coyote-like but still possessing aspects of a tarantula. Shiny black mandibles instead of teeth and far too many bony legs. The only thing that was still human was that wild black hair.</p><p>Xochi could feel the telekinetic power building in her extended hand. She thrust that hand forward and twisted. The Borderwalker reacted as if Xochi had grabbed a fistful of her curly hair, head cranked back and shrieking like an animal in a trap.</p><p>“Dean!” Xochi cried, sweeping her hand to her right and bringing the snarling Borderwalker with it as if attached by an invisible leash.</p><p>Dean was right there with the maquahuitl, swinging like Mickey Mantle. That weapon could cut off a horse’s head in one stroke but when it hit the Borderwalker it was like striking water. Her substance simply flowed around the blades.</p><p>“Again!” Xochi said.</p><p>Dean let the Borderwalker have it a second and third time. Aromatic smoke started to leak from gashes in the creature’s body and the liquid flow of her shape became sluggish, not so quick to reform. She lashed out at Dean, black vulture claws striking sparks against the silver chains around his neck. Dean faded back, then spun and brought the maquahuitl down sharply, neatly severing one of her skeletal hands. The hand fell to the carpet, became smoke and was gone. Sam moved in smoothly behind Xochi, placing himself between the Borderwalker and Brewer with his own maquahuitl raised and ready. They were winning.</p><p>Then the door burst open on its busted hinges and the last person Xochi expected to see walked into the room. Someone she hadn’t seen in more than ten years. Her older sister Teo.</p><p>Teo looked good, pin-up perfect as always. She was poured into high-waisted black-and-gold matador pants and a matching halter top with a plunging neckline. Teo was the one who got the boobs in the family and had always loved to lord her overflowing cleavage over her B-cup sister. She was six inches taller than Xochi in her pointy gold cockroach-killer heels. Her hair was piled high in a crown of flawless rockabilly curls and yellow marigolds.</p><p>But none of these details mattered, because the only thing Xochi could see when she looked at her sister was the leaf-shaped obsidian knife tucked into the waistband of her pants. It was very simple, rough-hewn and primitive. The handle and the blade were all one piece of glossy black stone, the only distinction being that the handle was smooth and the blade sharp. This was Itztlitlantl, a knife that had been in Xochi’s family for hundreds of years, a powerful and deadly weapon that could only be wielded by a woman of Xochi’s bloodline. A knife, that by right should be wielded by Xochi.</p><p>In that moment of anger, conflicted emotion and distracted attention, Xochi’s telekinetic hold on the Borderwalker faltered. Instead of going after Dean, the Borderwalker tore loose and threw herself at Brewer. Sam was there to block her, but she shifted form again, flickering like fire flowing around Sam and then suddenly right on top of Brewer, ripping into him with furious claws and teeth. Sam slammed his maquahuitl into the back of the Borderwalker’s head while Dean gripped the thing by the wiry pelt on her hunched back and pulled her off Brewer.</p><p>“Well, what are you waiting for, little sister?” Teo asked, speaking in their ancient native tongue. “Kill her.” She drew Itztlitlantl and shifted it skillfully from her left to her right hand. “Oh, that’s right. You can’t.”</p><p>“What do you want, Teo?” Xochi asked in English. “Can’t you see we’re busy here? Unless you’ve come to help...?”</p><p>Teo flicked the fingers of her left hand like she was brushing away lint. The Borderwalker reacted as if hit by a truck, flying backwards and slamming into the far wall. Xochi was stunned by this casual display of power. Teo had always been strong, but nothing like this. Sam and Dean both turned toward the newcomer, weapons held high, eyes narrow and suspicious.</p><p>“What the hell’s going on here, Xochi?” Dean asked.</p><p>There was no way to explain everything with the Borderwalker struggling back to her feet. No time. But even if there were time, Xochi had no idea where to begin.</p><p>Teo stepped up to the cowering Borderwalker and prodded the creature’s scrawny, trembling shank with the pointed toe of her shoe. She held Itztlitlantl in her hand but didn’t strike. Almost like she was teasing the thing. Teasing Xochi.</p><p>Xochi was so angry, she felt ready to spit razor blades. That bitch had a lot of nerve to show up here, flaunting Itztlitlantl in Xochi’s face. Like she had every right to wield it. Like she had never betrayed the family. Like Atlix was still alive and safe.</p><p>“You have no right,” Xochi cried, reverting to their native tongue. “No right.”</p><p>It was a bad idea, but Xochi couldn’t help herself. She lunged forward, grabbed Teo’s wrist and twisted, trying to force her sister to drop Itztlitlantli. Teo gave Xochi a sharp elbow to the face, knocking her back, bleeding from a split lip. Dean was between them and on Teo before Xochi could shake the stars from her eyes. The two of them went down, grappling, to the carpet.</p><p>Instead of attacking again, the wounded Borderwalker let out a miserable, desolate howl, clawing at the wall behind her. That wall suddenly opened into a yawning gateway and the Borderwalker tumbled backwards, pulling a few crumpled beer cans and a stray sneaker with her as she fell.</p><p>And just like that, she was gone. The gate snapped shut and all that was left was a the heavy, resinous scent of copal smoke.</p><p>Teo kicked free of Dean’s grip and leapt, cat-like to her feet.</p><p>“See what you’ve done?” Teo said. Then switching to English she added: “Do yourself a favor and stay out of my way. You and these... beefcakes.”</p><p>She spun on her heel and walked out the door.</p><p>Sam looked over at Dean, eyebrow arched.</p><p>“Beefcakes?”</p><p>Xochi ran to Brewer. He was bleeding from a hundred slashes, life swiftly draining out onto the filthy carpet. She knew what she had to do.</p><p>“Xochi,” Dean said, clenching his right hand like it pained him. “Who the hell was that?”</p><p>“There’s no time,” Xochi said. “I’m going to have to ask you to trust me.”</p><p>Xochi gathered Brewer up in her arms, ignoring the blood that soaked into her white shirt. She put one hand behind his neck and the other on his forehead, palm centered between his eyes. Unfortunately for Brewer, there was no time for seduction or easing her way in gently. She spoke the ancient words that would allow them to link minds and then unceremoniously kicked open the door to his memories just like she’d kicked open the door to his apartment.</p><p>She clawed her way through scattered flashes. Images from a lonely, alienated childhood. An awkward sexual encounter with an older girl who chewed gum the whole time. The smell of cordite, of burning bodies and fresh blood on hot Iraqi sand. That first luscious rush of heroin, like the world’s coziest blanket wrapped around a wounded soul. She could feel the structures swiftly crumbling inside his mind, but luckily the memory of that night fifteen years ago was just under the surface, as vital and malignant as the minute it was formed.</p><p>Men running through the moonlit Arizona desert. Brewer is one of them. They are chasing a woman through the tangled brush. A woman with curly black hair. She is carrying a dirty bundle in her arms. They lose her, spot her and lose her again. Now they’ve got her trapped in a cul-de-sac of steep, jagged rock. She turns to face them, hands up, defensive, begging them not to hurt her. The bundle is gone.</p><p>That was where the memory went strange. While every other one of Brewer’s memories, no matter how violent or ugly, seemed centered and intimate, this memory seemed to hit a bizarre kind of snag and all his senses were suddenly disconnected. He still had his vision but even that was strangely distant and colorless, like watching a black-and-white television with bad reception. He couldn’t hear the woman screaming and begging as he punched and kicked her again and again. He couldn’t feel her struggling body against his as he shoved her jeans down around her knees.</p><p>It was as if he was watching something happening through the windshield of a car driven by someone else. Feeling his memories, Xochi was glad for that anomaly, glad she did not have to share the sense memory of what it feels like to rape a dying woman.</p><p>Brewer is finished with the woman, and is standing back, watching Keene and Himes work her over. Porcayo has his back to the action, head in his hands and shaking. Brewer wants to turn away but can’t. He is sure that someone is watching him, another woman standing just out of range of his vision, but he can’t turn his head. Then Keene and Himes stand up, backing away from the dying woman and all of sudden, Brewer can move again. He can feel the gritty wind on his face. He can hear the woman’s wet, labored breathing. Everything is normal again, the way it should be, except for what they have just done. He looks at his fellow officers and they look at him. No one says a word. They just walk away. Like it never happened.</p><p>Xochi found herself evicted from Brewer’s mind just as suddenly and violently as she’d entered. She felt dizzy and disoriented from the abrupt transition. Brewer was dead in her arms.</p><p>“Let’s get the hell out of here,” Sam said. “Before the cops show up.”</p><p>Xochi let Brewer’s body drop to the sticky carpet and stood. She staggered a little and Dean was right there at her elbow to steady her. She leaned into him for a moment, glad he and Sam were there. She had no idea what would have happened if she’d had to face Teo alone.</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “Bacon cheeseburgers are on me. But in return, I want some damn answers.”</p><p>She knew it was unfair to ask the big gringos to trust her when she wouldn’t confide in them herself. But her feelings about Teo were so complicated, so contradictory. She hadn’t talked to anyone about her sister in years.</p><p>She thought of what Huehuecoyotl had said, that she needed to go home to find the Borderwalker, suddenly understanding with the pure clarity of hindsight. He didn’t mean that the Borderwalker was in her home town. He meant that she needed to look at her own family to figure out what was really happening.</p><p>“Okay,” she said to Dean. “No secrets. It’s the only way we can beat this thing.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Start with the chick with the big knife and the bigger attitude,” Dean said before biting into his second bacon cheeseburger of the day.</p><p>The three of them sat together in a different diner that may as well have been the Roadrunner Grill, or pretty much any diner Dean had ever been in. Xochi had taken a beat-up leather jacket from Brewer to cover the blood on her tank top, the over-sized man’s jacket incongruous on her feminine frame. Dean couldn’t help but notice that she had decided to sit next to him this time.</p><p>“That woman is my sister Teo,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Well, what was she doing at Brewer’s apartment?” Sam asked. “She a hunter too?”</p><p>“She used to be.” Xochi frowned. “Still is in a way. I don’t know.”</p><p>“Come on, Xochi,” Dean said. “You got to let us in. We can’t fight this thing if we don’t know the whole story.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said. “You’re right.” She poked at her fries, but didn’t eat. “Teo is my mother’s oldest daughter, and so naturally she was to become the head of our family when our mother died. She was more of a mother to me growing up than our mother ever was. We kids were moved around to various aunts and cousins, always on the move, traveling with hunters, but we always stuck together.</p><p>“What about your dad?” Dean asked.</p><p>Xochi frowned.</p><p>“Never met him,” she said with a shrug.</p><p>There was a beat of awkward silence at the table. Xochi pushed the salt shaker back and forth between her hands for a minute then continued.</p><p>“Teo is the best hunter I’ve ever known,” she said. “Taught me everything. Spells. Weapons. Hand-to-hand combat. But she likes hunting too much. Do you understand? She hunts for sport. Torturing her prey, like a cat playing with a mouse. It’s not about good and evil, it’s just a game to her. Our job is to maintain balance, not to revel in bloodsport.”</p><p>Dean thought of Gordon Walker, the hunter with the vendetta and the hard-on for killing vamps. Of Dean’s own hard-earned lessons on when to kill and when to let live. But even Gordon, as far off the deep end as he may have been and even after he was turned, still believed he was doing the right thing. Black and white, that was how he saw it. Even he didn’t hunt purely for sport. For the thrill of watching something suffer and die. Just the idea of it made Dean’s skin crawl, like a dry drunk listing to stories about someone else’s bender. Because, after all the time he had spent torturing souls in Hell, he knew exactly what he was capable of. Because he knew how easy it would be for him to go down that same road. Because he knew how much fun it would be.</p><p>He took a big slug of ice water, wishing it was whisky.</p><p>“There was...” Xochi began, then paused and shoved her plate aside, expression hard and distant. “A death. Our little brother Atlix.”</p><p>Dean felt like he ought to say something to comfort her from the obvious pain she was feeling, but he couldn’t find the right words. He just looked down at the shallow cut on his hand, feeling awkward and useless.</p><p>“The male children in our family do not hunt,” Xochi continued. “Atlix was nineteen, a student at UNAM. The first and only member of our family to attend college. Such a smart kid, loved computers. He wanted to be a video game designer. We always joked that he was going to make millions killing make-believe monsters while the rest of us lived in poverty fighting the real thing.</p><p>“That never happened. He was kidnapped and murdered. It was... retribution. The children of Xolotl, monstrous dog-headed creatures native to Southern Mexico, they came for him in the night. They wanted revenge for one of their own that had been tortured by Teo.” She curled her scarred hands into fists. “I was away on a hunt at the time. I rushed home as fast as I could, but I was too late. I couldn’t save him.</p><p>“Because of Teo’s irresponsible actions and indiscriminate killing, the elders made the decision to initiate me as the head of our family instead of her. But before the ceremony could be performed, Teo broke into the family temple and stole the sacred knife Itztlitlantl. Even if our brother were still alive, this act of sacrilege can never be forgiven.”</p><p>Dean saw that whatever emotion or vulnerability she had let slip while talking about her murdered brother had been swiftly buried, hidden under the quick-dry cement of righteous anger.</p><p>“Right, okay,” Sam said. “So what’s Teo doing here in Yuma?”</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t know,” Xochi said. “Maybe she is after our Borderwalker because she wants the challenge of hunting difficult and unique prey. Maybe she wants to beat me, to take my victory for herself and show that she is still the better hunter.”</p><p>“And what the hell did you do to Brewer after she left?” Dean asked.</p><p>She told them. Dean suddenly didn’t feel so hungry anymore.</p><p>“So you think this weird disconnect you felt in Brewer’s memory was some kind of psychological block?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Maybe,” Xochi replied. “Or maybe possession.”</p><p>“Possession?” Dean put his burger down. “Like demons?”</p><p>“No,” Xochi said. “Much more subtle than that. I’m beginning to think Huehuecoyotl wasn’t lying. I think there may be a larger force at work here. Something big.”</p><p>“So what’s the next step?” Sam asked, efficiently devouring the remains of his protein salad.</p><p>“The Borderwalker was injured in our fight,” Xochi said. “It may take her several days to recover her strength.</p><p>Meanwhile we should go to the last man, Porcayo. Follow him. Learn everything we can about him and see if we can find anymore clues that will let us know who is behind this.”</p><p>“Where’s he at again?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Fullerton, California,” Sam replied.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, holding up a hand for the check. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p>“One more thing,” she said, turning back to Dean and smirking, shooting him a mock dirty look. “Back when you were pretending we were FBI agents, did you name me after Selena?”</p><p>“I was on the spot,” he said. “It was the first thing that popped into my head.”</p><p>“Hey,” Sam said. “It’s better than Crockett and Tubbs.”</p><p>“Pendejo!” She punched Dean in the arm. “I hate that whiny bitch. Next time you let me think of names.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean was feeling a little light-headed that night when they pulled into a kitschy motel with a neon sign that read “THE PRICKLY PAIR.” Beneath it was a large painting of a busty pin-up cowgirl in a checked bikini hugging a huge, blatantly phallic cactus. Dean was looking forward to the day when they stayed in a motel that didn’t feature any cacti in its décor.</p><p>Xochi pulled her bike in behind the Impala and parked it under the sign.</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said, heading toward the tiny office. “Two rooms, right?”</p><p>Xochi pulled off her helmet and shook her head.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said. “I have a blanket.”</p><p>“What?” Dean asked. “You’re just gonna sleep outside? On the ground? Screw that. We’re getting you a room.”</p><p>“Unless you want to share a bed with my brother?” Sam put in with a grin.</p><p>“Sam,” Dean said. “Knock it off.”</p><p>“You can use my bed,” Sam said.</p><p>“With or without you in it?” Xochi asked eyebrow arched.</p><p>“Your choice,” Sam said. “But if you want me in it, it won’t be for sleeping. I don’t sleep.”</p><p>“I prefer my own room,” she said with another one of her patented smirks. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me,” Sam said. “Thank...” He pulled out his wallet and thumbed out a stolen credit card, reading off the printed name. “Duane Swierczynski.”</p><p>Sam went into the office. Dean leaned against the Impala, still feeling fatigued and slightly off balance. That fight had really taken a lot out of him, and he figured he was still suffering residual effects from the night before. The cut from Teo’s stone knife on his right hand throbbed as he opened and closed his cold fingers, massaging his wrist with his other hand. It felt inexplicably strange, like touching someone else.</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” he said, clenching his right hand into a tight fist. “Just tired, I guess.”</p><p>Sam returned with two keys attached to large plastic cacti emblazoned with room numbers 202 and 203.</p><p>“Upstairs,” Sam said. He handed one of the cactus keyrings to Xochi. “You take 03, we’ll take 02.”</p><p>Sam and Xochi went ahead, while Dean followed close behind. As he watched Xochi walk up the stairs in those tight leather pants with her gun-belt straps cinched just below the generous curve of her ass, he started to sweat, feeling so light-headed he thought he might not make it to the top. Xochi certainly did have a spectacular ass, but no ass in the world was that good. What the hell was the matter with him?</p><p>He made it to the top and paused, gripping the metal railing. The weak, dizzy feeling passed as quickly as it had come and he shook it off, heading down the breezeway to their rooms.</p><p>“Goodnight, boys,” Xochi said, keying open her room. “Tomorrow, Fullerton.”</p><p>“Right,” Sam said, opening their door. He held it open. “Dean, you coming?”</p><p>“In a minute,” Dean said, looking out over the dusty parking lot.</p><p>Sam shot Dean a look.</p><p>“I just need a minute, okay?” Dean said. “I’ll be right in.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. He closed the door.</p><p>Dean leaned against the railing. The rough, peeling paint flaked off under his touch. He looked at the closed door to Xochi’s room. Thought about knocking, but didn’t.</p><p>She really was an amazing hunter, one of the best he’d ever seen. So graceful, so intuitive, utterly unflappable under pressure. They worked together like a well-oiled machine. Like tango dancers. Like they’d been doing it for years. She was everything he could ever want in a hunting partner and then some, and it was getting harder and harder to ignore the chemistry between them. Which was really the last thing in the world he needed. It didn’t help that every time he found himself thinking about what it would be like with Xochi, he would think of Lisa, see her standing alone on her porch, shrinking down to nothing in the Impala’s rearview mirror. Of the stony finality in her voice when she’d told him to stay away from her and Ben. He thought of what Sam had said. Surely, she’d moved on with her life, right? Why shouldn’t she? Why shouldn’t he?</p><p>When he realized that he was just doing mental gymnastics to excuse sleeping with Xochi, he felt like a heel. The year he’d had with Lisa and Ben was the only time in his life when he’d ever been genuinely happy. And here he was trying to rationalize that away so he could spend a guilt-free night banging a chick with a nice ass.</p><p>Clearly, a drink was the answer. Hair of the dog that bit him. That was becoming the answer to way too many questions in his life, but he was too worn down to care.</p><p>He reached for the doorknob for room 202 and the dizziness suckerpunched him hard enough to rock him on his feet. The knob seemed to recede away from his fingers like scenery outside the window of a speeding train. He might have said Sam’s name, or maybe he just thought it.</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The next thing he knew he was on his back on a sagging motel-room bed, looking up at a large brown water stain shaped like the state of Texas. Sam stood over him on the left and Xochi on the right. She was holding his right wrist in both of her hands. She looked beautiful and deadly serious.</p><p>“Dean,” she said. “Why didn’t you tell me you’d been cut by Itztlitlantl?”</p><p>“What?” He frowned. “You mean your sister’s knife?”</p><p>“It is not her knife,” Xochi said. “By right it is my knife.”</p><p>“Okay, whatever,” Sam said. “I don’t care about your family drama right now, just tell us what’s wrong with Dean. Is he poisoned?”</p><p>“Worse,” Xochi said. “That knife was crafted by the great grandmother of my great grandmother’s great grandmother,” she said. “Carved from the tooth of a slain Tzitzimitl, a Star Demon. These are extremely powerful creatures whose obsidian bite can slice through souls. For this reason, they are also know as Souleaters.</p><p>“Itztlitlantl is the perfect weapon against ghosts and other unquiet spirits. It would also kill our rogue Borderwalker without a problem. But if it cuts a living human... The knife didn’t just cut your hand, Dean. It cut into your soul.”</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding,” Dean said.</p><p>“I wish I was,” she said. “Your soul is wounded and must be healed.”</p><p>“Awesome,” Sam said. “It couldn’t have been me that got cut with this thing.”</p><p>Xochi looked up at Sam with an unreadable expression. Dean could see wheels turning inside her head but couldn’t imagine what she was thinking.</p><p>“So what are you gonna do,” Dean asked. “Give me a stick to bite on while you pop a few stitches into my soul?”</p><p>“I can do nothing for you,” she said. “I’m no curandera.”</p><p>“Okay so...” Dean frowned. “What happens now?”</p><p>“Your soul will die.”</p><p>“Die?” Dean looked from Xochi to Sam and back again. “Whoa, what do you mean die?”</p><p>“It’s not so bad,” Sam said. “Not having a soul. I’m doing fine without mine.”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Xochi said to Sam. “Your soul isn’t in your body, but it is still vital. Still alive. If the soul dies, the body is left a mindlessly animated, rotting corpse.”</p><p>“A zombie?” Dean tried to sit up but couldn’t. “You mean I’m gonna go all Night of the Living Dead and try to eat your brains?”</p><p>“You won’t try to eat our brains, no,” she said. “But when the soul is dead, or if it has been devoured by one of the Tzitzimimeh, the animated body is attracted to other living souls. It will obsessively chew and claw into living flesh in a desperate attempt to get at the soul within, like a moth banging mindlessly against a light bulb.”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. “How long do I have?”</p><p>“It’s a small cut,” Xochi replied. “Twelve, maybe twenty-four hours.” Her expression was grave. Dean felt sick to his stomach. He looked up at his brother.</p><p>“Sammy, you’re not gonna let that happen to me are you?” Dean gripped his brother’s arm. “If it comes to that, you’ll take care of it, right?”</p><p>“Of course,” Sam said. “I’ll take care of it.”</p><p>“You weren’t supposed to answer that so quickly,” Dean said.</p><p>“Sorry,” Sam responded.</p><p>“So that’s it?” Dean said. “We just sit here and wait for me to Romero out so Dexter here can pop a cap in my rotten brain and put me out of my misery?”</p><p>“There is someone,” Xochi said. “Someone who can help you. But I don’t know if she will.”</p><p>Xochi pulled out her phone. Dialed. Turned away from Dean, speaking low even though he couldn’t understand her anyway. The language she was speaking was neither English nor Spanish.</p><p>Dean couldn’t understand her words, but he could gage her tone. It started pleading, then became angry. Then she broke off suddenly. She looked down at the phone.</p><p>“Well?” Dean asked.</p><p>She turned back to Dean, the answer in her expression.</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. “Plan B?”</p><p>“Let me try again,” Xochi said.</p><p>She went to the door and pulled it open, stepping out onto the breezeway. The door closed on another rush of incomprehensible words.</p><p>“What are we gonna do, Sam?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Sam said. “We could ask Cass.”</p><p>“I’m sure he’s getting a little sick of us tugging on his trenchcoat sleeve every time one of us gets beat up in the playground.”</p><p>“You got a better idea?”</p><p>Dean sighed and closed his eyes. The vertigo worsened, metallic nausea churning at the back of his throat.</p><p>“Hey, listen, Cass,” Dean said, flexing the fingers of his injured hand. Cold streaks of numbness raced through his forearm. “I know you’re real busy right now, what with the chaos in Heaven and all that...”</p><p>“No,” Castiel said, standing suddenly by the bathroom door, looking rumpled, unshaven and put-upon, just like always.</p><p>“No what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No I can’t help you,” the angel replied. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“You came all the way down here just to say you can’t help?” Dean pressed the fingers of his good hand against his temple. “Why bother? Why not just ignore me like usual.”</p><p>“I never ignore you, Dean,” Castiel said. “I never ignore either one of you. Sometimes I’m able to come and sometimes I’m not.”</p><p>“So why can’t you help him?” Sam demanded.</p><p>“You are...” He seemed to be searching for the right words. “Out of my jurisdiction.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, what?” Sam took a step forward. “Out of your jurisdiction? Since when do angels have jurisdiction?”</p><p>“You’re dealing with a whole different system of government here,” Castiel said. “Different gods. I’m not allowed to interfere.”</p><p>“Come on, just because we’re fighting Mexican monsters?” Dean said, struggling to sit up. The effort made his head swim. “There’s got to be, what, a billion Catholics in Mexico, right?”</p><p>“And there are a billion demons in Mexico too. In fact they have one of the highest demon to human ratios in the world, second only to Uganda. And if you were fighting one of those demons I would be happy to help you, but you aren’t. What you are up against is from a totally separate, independent spiritual realm. Upper management has a longstanding laissez-faire policy with other gods. By the terms of our recent agreement, they stay out of our business and we stay out of theirs.”</p><p>“But we’re your business,” Dean said. “Me and Sam. Aren’t we?”</p><p>“When you were up against Lucifer, did any Aztec deities show up to help you stop the apocalypse? Even though every one of their priests and chosen people would have also been destroyed if you had failed?”</p><p>“So, that’s it then?” Dean asked. “I’m walking worm food and there’s nothing anyone can do about it?”</p><p>“Your new friend is very capable,” Castiel said. “Like Sam said, she’s a hammer. You’re in her hands now.”</p><p>Xochi came through the door at that moment. Castiel was already gone.</p><p>“Good news and bad news,” she said.</p><p>“Bad news first,” Sam said.</p><p>“We must leave right away,” Xochi said. “We have to cross the border, to Tijuana. My grandmother will not come to the United States.”</p><p>“That’s not so bad,” Dean said. “Trip to TJ. We can have a few beers. Check out some strip clubs. Maybe get our photos taken sitting on one of those zebra-striped donkeys.”</p><p>“Good news?” Sam asked.</p><p>“My grandmother is a powerful curandera,” she said. “She will help Dean.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi went on ahead, with a promise to meet the brothers on the other side of the border. Said she had some things to take care of. Dean was in no condition to argue.</p><p>Sam helped Dean down to the Impala. Dean also wasn’t in any condition to argue when Sam wanted to drive.</p><p>As the Impala ate up the long desert miles, Dean leaned his dizzy head against the window. They passed a wordless graphic sign warning of illegal immigrants. A trio of silhouettes, a running man, woman and child.</p><p>“Tell me something,” Sam said</p><p>“What?” he asked.</p><p>“Are you still worried about Xochi trying to screw us over?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Dean said. “I mean, I’m pretty sure she’s human. She seems to be on the level, but... I just don’t know.”</p><p>He wasn’t about to tell Sam what he’d really been thinking about Xochi. He’d never hear the end of it.</p><p>“I think...” Sam began, then faltered. “...I think this hunt is important. I can’t say why, I just know it. It’s not just about Xochi and this Borderwalker. It’s bigger that that.”</p><p>He drove in silence for a few minutes before speaking again.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since anything seemed really important. I feel like I have to see this through, no matter what.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, Sammy,” Dean said. “I’m not gonna check out on you just yet.”</p><p>He hoped that was true.</p><p>Xochi had suggested they park the Impala in San Ysidro, on the American side of the border. Dean hated to leave his beloved ride, but not as much as he hated the idea of her getting stripped or stolen on the Tijuana street.</p><p>He had to lean heavily on Sam as the two of them staggered down the long cement walkway leading to the pedestrian border crossing.</p><p>The border guard who checked their IDs was beefy Latino guy with a thick neck and way too many big white teeth in his deceptively lazy smile. He gave Dean a casual once over.</p><p>“Is he okay?” the guard asked Sam.</p><p>“Him?” Sam hoisted Dean up a little straighter. “He’s fine. Just been pre-partying a little hard.”</p><p>Dean picked up on the ruse immediately and threw his uninjured fist into the air.</p><p>“DONKEY SHOW!” he bellowed with his best drunken slur. “WOO HOO!!!”</p><p>The guard shook his head, handed the IDs back to Sam.</p><p>“You two be careful out there,” he said.</p><p>When they finally made it through customs they were funneled out into a maze of more zigzagging walkways, only these were lined with vendors. Kids Ben’s age selling rock-hard gum and candy, faces stained with green and red rings from huffing paint. Old women selling plaster saints alongside weird, glossy knock-off statues of American corporate-owned characters. Piles of sombreros and maracas. Rugs featuring white tigers or Julio Iglesias or La Virgen de Guadalupe. Inflatable animals and piñatas shaped like masked wrestlers. In Dean’s weakened condition, walking the gauntlet of street sellers felt like the Bataan Death March.</p><p>A cute teenage girl ran over and handed Dean a flyer advertising generic Viagra and Rogaine at bulk discount. Two steps later another girl handed Sam a flyer advertising a strip club.</p><p>“What are they trying to tell us here?” Dean asked looking down at his flyer and then at Sam’s. “You know what, on second thought, don’t answer that.”</p><p>When they finally made it out onto the Tijuana street, Dean spotted Xochi right away. It was impossible not to.</p><p>She sat behind the wheel of a four-door ‘67 Impala. The number of doors and the fact that it rolled out of the Chevrolet factory the same year as his own were the only things the two vehicles had in common. This car had been chopped and channeled, sitting about a half an inch off the asphalt. It was painted a glossy, June-bug green impregnated with gold metal flakes. On the hood was an astoundingly gaudy painting of a muscle-bound Aztec warrior with a busty, mostly naked chick twined around one of his legs. As they approached, Dean saw the interior was done up in sparkly gold vinyl and lime-green fake fur. The hubcaps shined bright as diamonds.</p><p>When Xochi saw them she waved, punching the hydraulics and causing the car to hop and shimmy.</p><p>“Subtle,” Sam said opening the rear passenger door, tossing his bag into the back seat and then helping Dean in after it. “No one’s gonna notice us in this car.” He got into the passenger seat, next to Xochi.</p><p>“I thought you said it was too dangerous around here to drive a nice car,” Dean said. He was embarrassed by how good it felt to be sitting down.</p><p>“I said it was dangerous to drive your car,” Xochi said. “Everyone knows who this car belongs to. No one will touch it.”</p><p>“Whose car is it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I told you,” Xochi said, throwing the car into gear and peeling out. “A lot of people owe me favors.”</p><p>Dean tried to pay attention to the scenery outside the car, but it all seemed to run together into a surreal, sodium-lit blur of illegible signs, beater cars and taco-cart smoke. Some kind of kick-ass old-school rock and roll was blasting out of the Aztec Impala’s formidable, bass-heavy sound system but the lyrics were in Spanish.</p><p>Sam and Xochi were talking, laughing, but he couldn’t hear what they were saying. His hand throbbed in time with his heart. His chest felt heavy, every breath leaden. When he closed his eyes, he felt like he was falling. He wondered if Xochi’s grandmother was really going to be able to cure him and was struck with a sudden fear that he’d made a terrible mistake, agreeing to take on this job. A mistake that may never be undone.</p><p>He thought of the argument he’d had with Sam after leaving the grim prison where their grandfather had been torturing monsters. Sure, Dean put up a good front, but what if he really did die before Sam got his soul back? Dean knew he was the only thing keeping his brother tethered to his humanity. Without Dean, would Sam just give up? Resign himself to a life without emotion, without conscience? Dean couldn’t let that happen. This wouldn’t be the first time he’d been too damn stubborn to die. Probably wouldn’t be the last.</p><p>Some time later, Dean had no idea how long, Xochi pulled the Aztec Impala into a narrow driveway leading up to what looked at first glance like an armored military compound. It turned out to be a motel. Surrounded by razor-wire fencing, guarded by guys in black-out SWAT gear wielding automatic rifles. They waved Xochi through with big smiles, giving Sam and Dean enthusiastic thumbs-ups.</p><p>“Where are we?” Dean croaked.</p><p>“It is a house of women,” Xochi said. “We will be safe here.”</p><p>“House of women?” Sam arched an eyebrow. “You mean a brothel?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>“Awesome,” Sam replied.</p><p>“Why all the security?” Dean asked. “Poachers?”</p><p>“The competition is very fierce,” Xochi said. “Other houses have sent death threats to Tia Lupe.”</p><p>“Hooker Wars?” Sam looked back at Dean with an expression of baffled amusement. “Now there’s a reality show.”</p><p>“We are so not in Kansas anymore,” Dean replied.</p><p>A woman that had to be Tia Lupe came out to greet them. She was wearing a pink spandex dress that had been a bad idea ten years and fifty pounds ago. Too many rings on chubby, French-manicured fingers. Poofed-up bleached blonde hair and pencil-thin chola eyebrows.</p><p>“‘Sup, flaca?” she said when Xochi rolled down the window. “Introduce me to your sexy friends.”</p><p>“Sam in the front,” she said. “Dean in the rear. Boys, this is Tia Lupe.”</p><p>“Ma’am,” Sam said.</p><p>She said something to Xochi in Spanish that was obviously dirty. Then she switched back to English.</p><p>“Your abuelita is in twenty-one. Just pull into the garage. You boys need any room service, all you gotta do is ring.”</p><p>Xochi pulled out a roll of Mexican bills, pressed a few into Lupe’s hand and did as she instructed.</p><p>Dean was amazed to see that each room had its own private garage. When he commented on it, Xochi laughed.</p><p>“That is so your wife will not see your car when she’s out looking for you.”</p><p>Sam helped Dean out of the back seat and through a connecting door into the room itself. The décor was super tacky, all red velvet and roses and gold sparkles, but he was happy to note there was not a single cactus in sight. The air-conditioning was cranked to eleven, meat-locker cold after the sultry Tijuana summer outside.</p><p>Xochi’s grandmother was waiting for them in the room. Dean wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, some kind of cliché Native-American wise woman or something like that, but he was not prepared for the woman Xochi introduced him to.</p><p>“This is my grandmother, Toci,” she said. “She doesn’t speak any English.”</p><p>Toci was tiny like Dean had pictured she would be, but other than that, he couldn’t have been further off in his image of her. She had a giant purplish-red beehive hairdo that was obviously a wig and added a good eight inches to her height. Heavy Cleopatra eye make-up behind owlish glasses and ten pounds of weird, kitschy jewelry hung off her skinny neck and wrists. She wore a black-velvet tunic with a sparkly gold jaguar head on the front, shiny gold-lamé leggings and gold, high-heeled cowboy boots.</p><p>She said something snide and dismissive to Xochi. It didn’t sound like Spanish. Dean leaned against Sam in embarrassed silence as the two women went back and forth in some kind of heated exchange. Sam shook his head and led Dean over to the bed.</p><p>“Is she gonna help Dean or not?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean lowered himself slowly and gratefully onto the bed. His head was spinning, muscles weak and shaking.</p><p>Toci said something to Xochi, tipping her head toward Dean with her painted eyebrows raised expectantly.</p><p>“She wants me to tell you that it will hurt,” Xochi said.</p><p>“I can take it,” Dean replied.</p><p>Xochi translated his reply. Toci looked Dean up and down and then gave a curt nod. She said something to Xochi and Sam that needed no translation, accompanied as it was by a shooing gesture.</p><p>The two of them turned to leave. Xochi paused with her hand on the doorknob, looking back over her shoulder at Dean. She was obviously worried, but trying not to show it. Sam didn’t look back at all.</p><p>Dean could handle pain, but he had no idea what to do when Toci started yanking at his clothes like a drunk bachelorette at a Chippendales show. When he tried to stop her from pulling his shirt off, she slapped his good hand and said something stern. Dean had never had any strong female authority figures growing up and had absolutely no idea how to cope with being bossed around and man-handled by a little old lady. He had no choice but to let Toci have the shirt. But then she started unbuckling his belt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Whoa,” he said. “Look, lady, the cut’s on my hand.” He held his hand up as proof. “Hand! See? You don’t need to...”</p><p>She shoved him backwards onto the bed and pulled his pants down to his ankles.</p><p>“Okay then,” Dean said, looking up at his own mortified expression reflected in the mirrored tiles on the ceiling.</p><p>Toci unlaced his boots and took them off, then removed his jeans completely. Laying there on the bed dressed in nothing but crumpled white socks, he was really quite glad Sam and Xochi had left the room. Dean had never quite imagined his life might end like this. Naked in a Tijuana brothel with an eighty-year-old woman dressed like Janine from Spinal Tap sizing up his junk and looking distinctly unimpressed. He really wished the room wasn’t so heavily air-conditioned.</p><p>He knew there was no point fighting Toci. Whatever she needed to do to heal him, even if it included some kind of mystical ancient Aztec prostate exam, he’d just have to take it and like it. It wasn’t as if he had any other choice.</p><p>When she got down to business, Dean forgot all about feeling self-conscious. Xochi hadn’t been lying when she’d warned him that it would hurt. It was all he could do to keep still and keep whatever moans of agony he couldn’t stifle from cranking up into the girlier octaves.</p><p>What she was doing probably wasn’t all that dissimilar to one of Castiel’s angel cavity searches. But rather than sticking her hand into his chest, she was somehow teasing the wounded portion of his soul out through the cut on his palm. He hadn’t been that far off when he asked Xochi if she was going to put stitches in his soul. Unfortunately, there was no such thing as spiritual anesthesia.</p><p>When she finally stopped, he let out a long, shaky breath and clenched his wounded hand. It still hurt, but it was a pain he could handle.</p><p>Toci threw a fuzzy red blanket over his shivering body, tucking him in with a surprisingly tender touch considering her previously gruff demeanor.</p><p>“Thanks,” he said. “Um... gracias?”</p><p>She patted his chest and said something to him that he didn’t understand, but it didn’t seem to require a response. Then she called out for Xochi.</p><p>Xochi had clearly been waiting right on the other side of the door as she came in the second she was called. She had changed out of her blood-splattered tank top and into a cheap T-shirt that featured a pair of sexy female silhouettes and read “My friends got busy at Tia Lupe’s and all I got was this lousy T-shirt.” Her hair was bound back into the long twin braids she’d been sporting when they’d first met. No flowers. There was a brief exchange between her and Toci and then the older woman left the two of them alone.</p><p>“So what’s the prognosis?” Dean asked. “Am I gonna make it?”</p><p>“Your soul is still very sick, but healing.” She spotted the crumpled pile of Dean’s clothing on the carpet and looked up at him with a very slight smile.</p><p>“It wasn’t my idea, believe me,” he said.</p><p>She didn’t reply, just stood there with that same arch humor in her eyes.</p><p>“What? Isn’t that part of this whole healing mojo thing?”</p><p>Xochi shook her head.</p><p>“You don’t really need to be naked,” she said. “I think she just wanted to check out your body.”</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>“No,” she said, smile blooming. “I’m joking. Tight clothing restricts the flow of natural energy that you will need for the healing.”</p><p>“I don’t know if I believe you,” he said. “I think all you Aztec chicks are up to no good. Trying to take advantage of a sick, defenseless gringo.”</p><p>“If I wanted to take advantage,” she said, “I’m perfectly capable of doing it while you are strong and healthy. Or have you forgotten already?”</p><p>Dean hadn’t forgotten.</p><p>“Is your grandmother coming back?” he asked.</p><p>“She just went for some more supplies,” Xochi said.</p><p>“She’ll be back soon. She still has a lot more healing to do.”</p><p>“Don’t tell me that,” Dean said. “I barely made it through the first round.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Xochi said.</p><p>He could see that she really meant it. Under the wisecracks, she was still worried.</p><p>“You know,” Dean said, gesturing with his uninjured hand. “If we were in an action movie, this would be the scene where you tenderly dress my wounds. Then the wailing electric guitar ballad would kick in and we’d end up rolling around on the bed in a slow motion montage.”</p><p>“If we were in Q, The Winged Serpent,” Xochi replied, “this would be the scene where I sacrifice you to Quetzalcoatl.”</p><p>“I thought you said you’d never seen that movie.”</p><p>She took her phone out of her pocket, tapped the screen a few times, then turned it to face Dean.</p><p>“I was curious,” she said.</p><p>On the phone’s screen, the Aztec priest was about to cut some poor bastard’s heart out on top of the Chrysler Building.</p><p>“Sam is right,” she said. “This movie is terrible. Look, he’s holding that knife all wrong.”</p><p>Dean laughed, the laugh trailing off into a weak cough. His chest felt heavy, his right arm still leaden and strange.</p><p>“So,” Dean said. “Does this mean you won’t tend my wounds?”</p><p>“I’m a great hunter,” she said, crossing her arms and leaning back against the wall. “But I’m a terrible nurse.”</p><p>Dean realized he didn’t want to be alone.</p><p>“Just sit with me, then,” he said, patting the bed beside him. “Talk to me.”</p><p>“What do you want me to talk about?”</p><p>She stayed standing, arms still crossed. Wary.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “Please?”</p><p>She came over to the bed and sat perched on the edge.</p><p>“What’s your favorite movie?”</p><p>“Los Campeones Justicieros,” she said. “Mil Máscaras was my hero growing up.”</p><p>“Mil always did have the pimpin’ wardrobe. You gotta love a guy that’s man enough to fight monsters in leopard spandex.”</p><p>“That might be a good style for you,” she said. “I can introduce you the best tailor in Mexico City. She makes ring gear for all the top luchadores.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” he said. “When I’m facing off against an unholy soul-sucking abomination from beyond the grave, I want something a little more substantial than spandex to protect my future children.”</p><p>“What is your favorite movie?” she asked.</p><p>“Hard to pick just one,” he said.</p><p>“Not Q?”</p><p>“No,” he said. “And if you ask me again tomorrow, I’ll probably have a totally different answer, but tonight, I’d have to go with The Monster Squad. I want Shane Black to write all my dialog. Favorite band?”</p><p>“Caifanes.”</p><p>“Never heard of them,” Dean said.</p><p>“I also like the British band Led Zeppelin.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Dean smiled. “What’s your favorite Zep song?”</p><p>“‘Ramble On,’” she said. “I feel like that song has so much meaning for me, for my life. You know?”</p><p>He looked up at her.</p><p>“Don’t you have someone? Boyfriend?”</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“Girlfriend?”</p><p>“No,” she said. “No one. I mean, I tried but...” She shrugged again. “I was a terrible wife too.”</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“You know,” she said. “Things don’t always work out.”</p><p>Dean didn’t say anything. He could sense she wanted to say more. He waited.</p><p>“I tried to walk away... to be a normal person.” She looked down at her scarred hands. “But this life. Hunting. It’s the only thing I’m really good at.”</p><p>He wanted to tell her that he got it, that he understood so well it hurt, but again he couldn’t find the words. She crossed her arms again, turning her body away from him. Distant, sealing herself up.</p><p>“Maybe you just need to find someone more like you,” he said.</p><p>She looked back at him.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean someone who really understands you,” he said. “What you’ve been through. Someone who’s been there. You know, someone you can trust to have your back in a fight.”</p><p>“Someone like you, maybe?” She smiled, just a little. “Dean, you want to be my boyfriend?”</p><p>“Of course not,” he said. “I just meant...”</p><p>“That is a beautiful dream,” she said. “Warrior lovers, fighting side by side, going down together in a blaze of glory. But you and I, we are so much alike, aren’t we? And as beautiful as that dream may be, I know that you don’t really want that any more than I do.”</p><p>“Then what do you want?”</p><p>“The same thing you want. The thing we’ve both wanted so desperately ever since we were children. The thing we both need and fear we may never be allowed to have.”</p><p>“Yeah, what’s that?” Dean asked, even though he was pretty sure he already knew the answer.</p><p>“A home,” she said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. Like he was crazy for asking.</p><p>She was getting way too close to messy, painful truths that Dean thought he’d buried good and deep. Feelings about Lisa and Ben, about his dead mother and Sam and all those long sleepless nights on the road. He needed to crack a joke, to reinforce the armor. To regain control of the conversation and steer it back to safer waters.</p><p>“Okay, so forget the whole blaze of glory thing,” Dean said. “How about gratuitous, casual sex?”</p><p>He was only half kidding.</p><p>She laughed, but he could hear the relief underneath her laugh. She was as glad to change the subject as he was.</p><p>“That would be very nice,” she said turning away from him again. “But I don’t think you understand how badly you are hurt. You need to conserve your energy to heal your soul.”</p><p>He put his uninjured hand on the small of her back, following the channel of her spine with his fingertips.</p><p>“You could lend me some of yours,” he said.</p><p>She arched her back almost imperceptibly against his touch, making a wordless, throaty purring sound so soft Dean thought maybe he was imagining it.</p><p>Toci chose that moment to return, lugging a large woven plastic bag.</p><p>Xochi stood, exchanging a few words with her grandmother. The old woman took out a beat-up plastic two-liter soda bottle with no label and handed it to Xochi. It was full of something that wasn’t soda. Something pale, milky and viscous. Xochi took the bottle and looked back at Dean. Her gaze was guarded, but he was almost sure he saw something there. Some kind of connection maybe. She turned and left the room before he could be sure.</p><p>Toci came to his bedside and pulled a second bottle of that strange beverage from the bag. She unscrewed the plastic cap and held it to his lips, telling him something he didn’t understand. He had no choice but to drink it. Drink it or wear it.</p><p>Whatever it was, it was alcoholic. It tasted sort of like rotten pears soaked in moonshine and had an unpleasant, slimy texture. When she pulled the bottle away from his lips, there was a snotty clear stringer like Alien spit connecting the mouth of the bottle to his lower lip. His stomach did a slow lurching roll, but the warm familiar burn of the alcohol spread through him, relaxing the knots in his spine and dulling the pain in his hand.</p><p>Toci poured some of the gooey liquid into a plastic bowl and added a bunch of dried plants and powders. Dean couldn’t help noticing a large amount of orange marigold petals. If this worked, he promised to take back anything bad he’d ever said about the humble little flower.</p><p>Round two was even worse, if that was possible. It seemed to go on for hours and when it was done, Dean was close to passing out. He hoped the moisture on his face was sweat and not tears.</p><p>The herbs had been steeping in the strange milky liquor while Toci worked, imbuing it with a bitter peppery scent. Dean thought she was going to make him drink it, but instead she gave him another, unadulterated swig straight from the plastic bottle and then used the stuff in the bowl to soak his hand.</p><p>She lit several candles in glass tubes, inscribed with various lurid designs: burning women and tattooed hands and curious symbols. Then, she pulled his hand out of the bowl and wrapped it in gauze. She spoke some melodic words over him and then turned and left him alone in the tacky room.</p><p>Dean drifted. Dreamed of Lisa. Of home.</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi found Sam sitting on the curb outside the garage connected to their room. A group of prostitutes were hanging around by the door to the office, eyeing Sam like he was a raw steak in a dog kennel. He was lost in thought, however; ignoring them completely.</p><p>Xochi sat down on the curb beside him. She unscrewed the cap off the bottle her grandmother had given her, took a long swallow and then handed it to Sam. He nodded and drank. Made a funny face, like a baby who’d been given a chili pepper for the first time.</p><p>“What the hell is that stuff?” Sam asked, wiping his lips on the back of a big fist.</p><p>“Pulque,” Xochi said. “Help me finish the bottle and I’ll show you how to spit the last sip in the shape of a scorpion.”</p><p>“Poolkay?” He took another swig. “It’s kinda weird, but I kinda like it.”</p><p>“It’s made from fermented maguey, very thick and sticky,” she said. “When you get to the bottom of the bottle, you spit that last sticky mouthful onto the floor and if the pulque is good, your spit will look like a scorpion.”</p><p>“I’ll drink to that,” Sam said, taking one more swig and then passing the bottle back to Xochi.</p><p>She drank deep, and tried to organize her chaotic thoughts.</p><p>“Sam,” she said. “I know I can say this to you and you will not react badly, but I need to make sure you and I understand each other.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “Shoot.”</p><p>“What happened to your brother is my fault,” Xochi said. “He was cut because he was trying to protect me. For that I am sorry.” She paused. Passed the bottle. “He is not out of danger. There is still a chance that he may not make it.”</p><p>“I know,” Sam said. He drank. No reaction.</p><p>“He’s a good hunter,” she said. “I like fighting next to him. If he dies tonight, I will own that responsibilty for the rest of my life.”</p><p>She could still feel Dean’s touch on the base of her spine. She held her hand out for the bottle. Sam handed it back to her. She took a swig.</p><p>“What I must ask is this,” she said. “Sam, are you still with me in this fight, no matter what happens to your brother? Because I want Dean to make it... to fight with us... but I need you. Do you understand? If he dies, you and I can still do this. But without you...”</p><p>“No problem,” he said without hesitation. “I’m in. No matter what.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she said.</p><p>The two of them drank in silence for a few minutes. They watched the prostitutes share cigarettes and hustle clients. One of the younger ones got lucky. Xochi watched her steer her tipsy American prey into one of the rooms, shamelessly clipping his wallet before she’d even unlocked the door.</p><p>“What does it feel like,” Xochi asked. “Not having a soul?”</p><p>“It doesn’t feel like anything,” Sam replied. “I mean, I can tell something’s missing. Like I know I’m supposed to be upset by the idea that my brother might die, but I’m not. Because I know you and I can handle this hunt without him.” He looked at her, then away. “The thing is, when I know there’s something I’m supposed to be feeling, something important, I just can’t seem to leave it alone in my head. Even if I’m not sure what it is, I keep on thinking about it. Thinking in circles. It’s like...” He swirled the milky contents of the bottle, staring into nothing for a moment before taking another swallow. “It’s like having a pulled tooth. You can’t stop touching the space where it used to be with your tongue. It was much worse when I first came back. But now... I think I’m getting used to that hole. Sometimes I think I’m better off this way.”</p><p>He handed the pulque back to Xochi and she looked into his eyes, green eyes like Dean’s, but flat and lifeless. She suddenly felt like a monster.</p><p>What Sam was going through was horrible, a unique and profound kind of torment that she could only imagine, and never once had she even bothered to think of what it was like for him. All this time, she’d looked at the big gringo as nothing more than a useful tool. A piece of the puzzle presented by her visions. A weapon that she knew would be critical to her victory. She still had her soul, or whatever tattered shreds might be left after everything she’d been through, and yet here she was thinking just like Sam. Thinking only about winning this fight no matter what the cost. But every day this boy spent without his soul, he was becoming less and less human. He shouldn’t be wasting time hunting with her, he should be fighting to get his soul back. Before he gets too comfortable with that hole.</p><p>“No,” she said, handing him the bottle. “You’re not better off like this. Now, for this hunt, maybe, but not in the long run.”</p><p>“You don’t know the whole story,” Sam said. “I have my reasons.” He drank. Wiped his lips. “Look, I don’t want to talk about it anymore. All you need to know is that I’m gonna see this thing through with you. You can count on me.”</p><p>Xochi nodded. She wasn’t going to argue with that.</p><p>“You know,” Sam said, passing the bottle back. “There’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you about. Something that’s been bothering me for a while now.”</p><p>Xochi drank and waited for him to elaborate.</p><p>“This knife your sister has,” he said. “The one that cut Dean. You say it could kill our Borderwalker?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said.</p><p>“So why didn’t she use it?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean she had her shot, why didn’t she take it?”</p><p>Xochi frowned.</p><p>“Dean stopped her,” she said. “Then the Borderwalker crossed over before she could...”</p><p>“No.” Sam shook he head. “Dean only went after her when she threw that elbow at you, but she had plenty of time before that. I think she didn’t want to kill the thing.”</p><p>“Why not?” she asked.</p><p>“You tell me.”</p><p>Xochi took another thick, sticky swallow from the bottle, but any kind of comfortable intoxication that may have been building up was swiftly burned away by thorny, unanswered questions.</p><p>Was Teo just toying with the Borderwalker, or was there something more sinister behind her actions? Why was she there in the first place? How did she fit into all this?</p><p>They drank together in silence for a few more minutes. The bottle was nearly empty.</p><p>“Tell you what,” Sam said suddenly. “Why don’t we forget about all this and get a room.” He leaned close to her, put an enormous paw on her thigh. “I’ll let you do you anything you want to me. Anything. Upside of having no soul.” He drank. Smiled. “No inhibitions.”</p><p>“You know, your brother also asked me to make love with him tonight.”</p><p>“Yeah, well,” Sam said, dipping his chin and raising his eyebrows. “I’m bigger.”</p><p>She laughed. Took the bottle.</p><p>“No thank you, Sam,” she said.</p><p>“Okay,” he said, taking his hand off her leg and showing her his palms. “You’re into him. I get it. Anyway, to be fair, he needs it way more than I do.”</p><p>“I’m not ‘into him’” she said. “I just... We have more important things to worry about right now.”</p><p>“Man,” he said, rolling his eyes. “You two are like peas in a frickin’ pod.”</p><p>Sam stood and took his wallet from his hip pocket, extracting a few American bills and then handing the wallet to Xochi.</p><p>“Hold this for me, will you?” he said. “I’m gonna order up some room service.”</p><p>He walked over to the group of prostitutes by the office. Xochi watched with amusement as he struggled to communicate with them using his high school Spanish. He was right, he could get his point across when he needed to. He walked away with two of the best-looking girls, one on each arm.</p><p>Xochi sucked the last of the pulque from the bottle and spit the gooey dregs on the cement between her boots. The resulting blob didn’t look much like a scorpion. More like a spiny butterfly.</p><p>She thought about checking in on Dean, but knew she didn’t need to. Toci was with him and he would either make it or he wouldn’t. Having Xochi standing around staring at his bare chest wasn’t going to speed up the healing process.</p><p>She thought about Teo. About what Sam had said. About what Huehuecoyotl had said. She wondered once again what they were really up against.</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Dean woke up, the first thing he saw was the back of Xochi’s neck. No tattoos on that particular area, just smooth brown skin and a few little wisps of black hair that had escaped her braids. He’d only had a couple mouthfuls of that weird liquor, but if he’d somehow managed to score with Xochi after all and didn’t remember a thing, he was going to be seriously pissed.</p><p>Taking more detailed stock of the situation, Dean saw that she was fully dressed, sleeping on top of the covers with her back to him. Highly unlikely that she would have bothered to get dressed again after the horizontal mambo but before falling asleep.</p><p>He reached out to wake her, brushing her tattooed arm with his fingers.</p><p>She reacted with the speed of a striking rattlesnake, grabbing his wrist and rolling toward him, switchblade open in her other hand.</p><p>“Good morning,” Dean said. “Coffee?”</p><p>She let him go, closing the knife and looking sheepish.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said. “I guess I’m a little jumpy. How are you feeling?”</p><p>He paused for a moment to take internal inventory. Opened and closed his bandaged hand. He felt good. Better, in fact, than he had in months.</p><p>“Okay, I think,” he said.</p><p>“Good,” Sam said. Dean hadn’t even noticed his brother, sitting silently in a plush red chair on the far side of the room. “We gotta get out of Dodge and beat the Borderwalker to Fullerton.”</p><p>“I’m glad you are still with us, Dean,” Xochi said, rolling away from him and sitting up, stretching her arms above her head. “Toci said your soul is very strong. Almost as strong as a woman’s.”</p><p>Dean laughed.</p><p>“I guess I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>Xochi stood, rolling her neck to work the kinks out while stepping into her boots. Sam stood too, slinging his bag over his shoulder. Laptop already packed up and ready to hit the road.</p><p>Dean lay there for a moment with the fuzzy blanket clutched against his bare chest, eyeing the inside-out scatter of his clothes on the carpet.</p><p>“Um... I’d better...” He flapped his hand in the directions of his clothes. “You know.”</p><p>“What?” Xochi asked. “You’re shy? You only allow old ladies to see you naked?”</p><p>She snickered and cut him off before he could come up with anything resembling a snappy retort.</p><p>“We’ll be waiting in the car,” she said.</p><p>Xochi dropped them back off at the pedestrian border crossing, promising to meet them in Fullerton. When Dean pressed her to set an exact meeting place, she refused. She said that she would find them.</p><p>Getting back into the U.S. was a much bigger deal than getting out. Drug-sniffing dogs were walking along the line. Guys with rubber gloves and humorless scowls searched through Sam’s laptop bag for nearly half an hour. For once, Dean actually hadn’t done anything questionable but he still felt anxious and convinced they’d find some reason to detain him. He could only imagine how much harder it would have been if he or his brother looked even vaguely Latino.</p><p>When they finally made it back to American soil, Dean was so happy to see his own car he almost kissed the hood.</p><p>“Think she can tell we’ve been rolling in another Impala?” Sam joked as Dean got behind the wheel.</p><p>“Don’t listen to him, baby,” Dean said, patting the dash. “I swear, she meant nothing to me. I didn’t even drive, honest.”</p><p>The journey to Fullerton was pretty uneventful. They passed more of the running immigrant family signs and some sort of weird power plant that looked like a giant pair of silicone breasts. Traffic was light, almost non-existent. Even with a stop for chow and coffee, they still made it to Porcayo’s place in record time.</p><p>Fullerton was suburban and unremarkable. Porcayo lived in an unremarkable house on an unremarkable street. It was a Witness Protection kind of neighborhood. The kind of place you forgot the second you left.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, pulling up to the curb a couple of houses down from the target. “What have we got?”</p><p>“José Ibarita Porcayo,” Sam read off the screen of his laptop. “Forty-nine years old. Works at HandyMart, a franchise hardware store, during the day. Security for an office building at night. Married to a grade school teacher, Irma Diaz Porcayo, for twenty-one years, until her death six months ago. Cancer. Just one kid. A daughter, Claudia, fifteen. Looks like she was adopted.”</p><p>“Did you say fifteen?” Dean raised his eyebrows and leaned across the seat to look at the laptop’s screen.</p><p>“Fifteen years and nine months to be exact,” Sam said. “You thinking what I’m thinking?”</p><p>“Abandoned female infant,” Dean said. “Age nine months. Mother never found.”</p><p>“You think he actually adopted the daughter of the woman he and his buddies raped and murdered?”</p><p>“That’s how it looks, doesn’t it?” Dean sat back, stunned.</p><p>“I’ll see what I can dig up in the way of adoption records,” Sam said, keys clicking. “You keep an eye on the house.”</p><p>Dean couldn’t even imagine what it must be like for Porcayo, living every day with that girl. Raising her as his own. Did he see her mother every time he looked at her?</p><p>Then, as if invoked by Dean’s speculation, a teenage girl came walking down the street. She was short and a little chubby, a gothy Hot Topic baby bat. Crayon red streak in her hair. Too much eyeliner, applied with a heavy, inexpert hand. Steel ring through her pouty lower lip. Unflattering black skinny jeans and a red-and-black striped T-shirt with a cute, cartoony skull on the front. Emily the Strange backpack. She walked with her arms tightly crossed, shoulders curled inward with the tense, wary body language of someone trying to avoid the attention of bullies. Dean was pretty sure this was Claudia, and his suspicions were confirmed when she turned into the target house, opening the front door with a key on a chain crowded with dangling bats and beads and big-eyed Japanese anime figures.</p><p>“It’s only 11:30,” Sam said peering at his watch. “Shouldn’t she be in school?”</p><p>“Cutting class maybe?” Dean suggested.</p><p>“We should probably to talk to her,” Sam said.</p><p>“Well we obviously can’t just kick the door down and shove a gun in her face,” Dean said.</p><p>He looked down the street, wondering where Xochi was and how long it would be before she showed up. Weird, how quickly he’d gotten used to having her around. It didn’t seem possible that just two days ago, he wasn’t even sure she was human.</p><p>“Do you think she knows?” Sam asked.</p><p>“About her mother’s murder?” Dean shook his head. “No way. And I’m not gonna be the one to tell her.” He cut Sam off before he could speak. “Neither are you. Trust me on this. We don’t go there unless we absolutely have to.”</p><p>“One other thing,” Sam said. “Remember that the Borderwalker just showed up inside Brewer’s apartment. It’s not like we’re gonna see her walking down the street before she attacks. By the time we realized anything was going down inside that house, it would be too late.”</p><p>“So what,” Dean asked. “We break in and set up a duckblind in the bedroom closet?”</p><p>“I think we should head over to HandyMart,” Sam replied. “Have ourselves a chat with Dad.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The HandyMart was a cavernous, sprawling warehouse with piles of plywood and PVC piping stacked to the mile-high ceiling. Fenced outdoor garden center off to one side, full of leggy juvenile citrus trees and brambly pink-and-red bougainvillea. Aisle after aisle of bathroom fixtures and closet organizers and every shape and size of screw ever invented. It smelled like hot sawdust and fresh paint.</p><p>It took them nearly twenty minutes of searching the aisles to find Porcayo. They eventually spotted him in the light fixture section, one hand on a shelf and his face turned away from them. He had thick, wavy black hair and dark brown skin. Maybe five-foot eight with a stocky, muscular build. He wore neatly pressed khaki pants and a green HandyMart polo shirt, plus a cheery yellow apron with his name on it and a smiley face button that said “Happy to Serve You!”</p><p>“Excuse me,” Dean said.</p><p>Porcayo turned to them, startled. Dean saw that the man had been crying. His square-jawed, handsome face was contorted and ugly with grief, dark eyes bloodshot and raw. He pressed a shaking hand to his lips. Dean felt instantly uncomfortable and embarrassed for the older man.</p><p>“Welcome to HandyMart,” Porcayo said, voice cracking slightly. “How can I help you?”</p><p>Dean was at a loss for a moment, confronted with the intense emotion in the man’s tortured face, but Sam jumped right in, stoic and unruffled.</p><p>“Mr. Porcayo,” Sam said, badge in hand. “I’m Special Agent Kolchak. My partner Agent Summers. Is there somewhere we can speak in private?”</p><p>“Is this about Claudia?” Porcayo asked. “She’s a good girl, really. She’s just been through so much. Losing her mother...”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a look.</p><p>“Well,” Dean said. “It is and it isn’t. But we really should discuss this in private.”</p><p>Porcayo pulled in a long, shaky breath. Wiped his lips again.</p><p>“Yeah, okay,” he said.</p><p>He led the brothers into a grungy little breakroom near the public toilets. Dusty drop ceiling and scuffed linoleum. Cheap card-table with a few dented metal folding chairs. There was a pair of vending machines on the far side of the room, one filled with generic, off-brand soft drinks and the other an array of unappetizing, fossilized snacks. A staticy television bolted to the wall played some kind of animal show featuring badly lit home video clips of cats and dogs knocking over toddlers. Dean got the distinct feeling that the corporate masters of HandyMart would really rather their employees didn’t take breaks.</p><p>“Why did you think we wanted to ask you about your daughter?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Well,” Porcayo looked at the television screen for a moment, then down at the toes of his beat-up work boots. “The skipping school, the shoplifting and then that destruction of public property thing two weeks ago. My wife...” He swallowed hard. “When she got sick again... Claudia started acting out. Irma, my wife, she always used to say that I’m too soft on Claudia, that I don’t discipline her enough. She was right, I know. But now, with Irma gone...” He spread his hands, palm up. “I just don’t know what to do anymore.”</p><p>Dean thought the guy was going to break down again. Dean couldn’t help but feel for him, and he had to remind himself of what Porcayo and his buddies had done to Claudia’s real mother. Apparently, Sam didn’t need to be reminded.</p><p>“This isn’t about shoplifting,” Sam said. “This is about rape. Rape and murder.”</p><p>Porcayo staggered as if Sam had slapped him. He gripped the back of one of the folding chairs to hold himself up and then lowered himself slowly into the seat.</p><p>“I saw the news,” Porcayo said. “They’re all dead. Keene, Himes and Brewer.” He looked down at his calloused hands like they were stained with blood. “It’s her, isn’t it?</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said.</p><p>“And now she’s coming for me.”</p><p>“I’m afraid so.”</p><p>Porcayo put his head in his hands.</p><p>Dean was extremely glad to have Sam take the wheel on this one. He knew he shouldn’t be so sympathetic but he couldn’t help it. After all, if Porcayo really had been possessed in some way and unable to control his actions, he could hardly be blamed for what had happened that night. Plus he’d tried so hard to make up for what he’d done, taking the kid in and raising her as his own. Having her there every day as a living, breathing reminder of his unspeakable crime. Without him, who knows what would have happened to that baby.</p><p>“Look, Mr. Porcayo,” Sam said. “We can help you, but...”</p><p>Porcayo took an orange plastic box cutter from a pocket in his apron and thumbed the blade open.</p><p>“Whoa,” Dean said, grabbing Porcayo’s wrist before he could slash open the inside of his forearm. “Okay, take it easy now.”</p><p>“Let me go!” Porcayo hissed, struggling against Dean and kicking over the chair.</p><p>“Just take it easy, José,” Dean said. “Can I call you José?” Dean repeated Porcayo’s first name in a soft voice, trying to calm him down. “Please, José, just listen. We’re here to help you. You and Claudia, okay?”</p><p>A petite Latina with disproportionately big hair and big gold loop earrings pushed the door open with her shoulder, texting on her cell phone. She was dressed the same as Porcayo, khakis, polo shirt and a yellow HandyMart apron, but somehow managed to make her outfit look provocative and ultra-feminine. She paused in front of the door for a moment, thumbs flying on the tiny keyboard and eyes riveted on the screen. When she looked up and spotted Dean and Porcayo, frozen with the boxcutter held high above their heads, she did a broad, comical double take, bumping backwards into the door.</p><p>Sam badged her.</p><p>“Official business,” Sam said. “I’m gonna have to ask you to step outside, ma’am.”</p><p>For a second she just stared at Sam, over-glossed lips hanging slackly open.</p><p>“Um,” she finally said. “Yeah, okay. I’ll just... come back later.”</p><p>She backed out the door, never taking her wide, disbelieving eyes off Dean and Porcayo.</p><p>When she was gone, Porcayo let go of the box cutter, letting it clatter noisily to the linoleum. Sam picked up the fallen chair and set it upright. Dean eased up on his grip, and guided Porcayo back to the chair. Porcayo sat, shoulders slumped, hopeless and defeated. He didn’t cry. He just sat there, staring at nothing.</p><p>“Nobody calls me José,” he said, his voice a dull monotone. “Except my mother.”</p><p>“So what do they call you?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Joey,” he said.</p><p>“Listen to me, Joey,” Sam said. “If we’re going to stop her, we need you to tell us everything about what really happened on the night of April 18th 1995.”</p><p>“Look, man, I was there,” Porcayo said. “And even I’m not sure what really happened.”</p><p>Dean and Sam didn’t press him, they just waited for him to continue.</p><p>“I’m not trying to cop out and say it wasn’t my fault,” Porcayo said. “But something happened to the four of us that night. Something I can’t explain. I’ve been over it and over it in my head, every night for fifteen years. Trying to understand. I mean, I’m no angel. I got into some trouble when I was growing up. Fights, that kind of thing. But in all my life, I would never hurt a woman. Never.”</p><p>He got up and walked over to the soda machine. Put in some coins and pulled out a can of cola. Popped it open and took a sip. He didn’t sit back down.</p><p>“Before my father took off, he used to hit my mother.” He looked down at the can in his hand as though the nutritional information was profoundly fascinating. “He hurt her so bad she couldn’t have no more children. I was her only son, and she made me swear to her every day that I would never be like him. I have a lot of anger inside me, just like his anger. It’s in my blood, and I know I could be like him if I’m not careful. That’s why I would never let that anger out on a woman, no matter what. Before I met Irma, I was dating this chick who used to get all crazy, throwing stuff and slapping me. She stabbed me in the arm with a pen one time. I never did nothing back to her, I just walked away. My friends made fun of me for years because of that, but that’s how important my promise was to me. I just don’t understand how a promise that was so important could go right out the window for no good reason. That poor woman didn’t do nothing to me. She was just trying to get away.”</p><p>“At any point during the attack,” Sam said, “did you feel like you were not in control of your body?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Porcayo said. “That’s exactly how I felt. I kept on trying to stop, even just to turn my head away, but I couldn’t. It sounds crazy, I know, but...”</p><p>“We believe you, Joey,” Dean said.</p><p>“What can you tell us about what happened after the assault?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We...” Porcayo wiped his lips again. “We just left her there. We all had control over our bodies at that point, but... We didn’t do anything to save her. We were all so ashamed of what had happened that we just walked away. That still haunts me.”</p><p>He finished the soda. Crushed the can.</p><p>“When we had rounded up all the other migrants in the group, I went back to her. I felt so horrible about what had happened that I went back to try and help her. She was gone. I don’t mean dead, I mean gone, like she had never been there. That’s when I heard a baby crying. That’s when I found Claudia.”</p><p>“My wife couldn’t have kids. She had to have a hysterectomy because of cervical cancer when she was just twenty-three and she thought no man would ever want to marry her. But she was so smart and so pretty. She was my angel, the best thing that ever happened to me. Better than a guy like me deserved.” He choked up and had to pause for a moment. “She was so happy when I brought home the paperwork to adopt Claudia. She never knew anything about what really happened. Neither one of them ever knew. I told them her mother died trying to cross the border.”</p><p>He looked up at Dean.</p><p>“Is Claudia in danger?”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Dean said. “We really have no way of knowing. I don’t think so, but I also think it would be a good idea for her to stay with relatives or friends, until we catch this thing.”</p><p>“You really think you can stop her?” Porcayo asked.</p><p>“We’re gonna try,” Sam said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean followed Porcayo’s crummy little blue Toyota back to the unremarkable house, while Sam rode with Porcayo to make sure the older man didn’t pull a runner. Dean parked the Impala while the Toyota pulled into the garage, slung Xochi’s rifle bag over his shoulder, then got out of the car.</p><p>By the time Dean got up to the door, Sam already had it open. Porcayo stood beside him.</p><p>“Is Claudia here?” Dean asked, handing the rifle bag to Sam.</p><p>Porcayo shook his head.</p><p>“She’s still at school.”</p><p>“I hate to break it to you,” Dean said. “But we saw her come home about an hour ago.”</p><p>Porcayo frowned. Took a cell phone out of his pocket. Dialed. Waited.</p><p>“Where the hell are you?” he said into the phone. “You better call me as soon as you get this message...” He hesitated for a moment. “I’m not mad, mija. Just please call okay?”</p><p>He ended the call and stared down at the phone, tears welling in his eyes again. He swiped at the tears with his knuckles, gritting his teeth against their onslaught. He raised the phone, clenching it in his fist and looking like he was about to throw it for a moment, but didn’t.</p><p>“If something happens to her,” he said. “Because of me...”</p><p>“Why don’t we go inside,” Dean said.</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Porcayo said. “Of course.”</p><p>The house was generic and unremarkable on the outside, but on the inside the décor was quirky and colorful. It was painfully clear to Dean that the romantic vintage movie posters and charming folk-art had been selected by the late wife. All the funny little wooden animals were dusty, sad and neglected. There was a pair of gaudy red women’s reading glasses sitting on the coffee table, next to an empty coffee cup and a paperback romance novel. Dean was pretty sure it wasn’t Porcayo’s book. Or Claudia’s. The room felt like a shrine.</p><p>“Can I get you something?” Porcayo asked. “Beer?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. “That’d be great.”</p><p>Porcayo led them into a large kitchen that was overrun with dirty dishes, take out containers and beer cans.</p><p>“I’m sorry it’s so messy,” Porcayo said. “I keep telling Claudia to clean up around here once in a while, but she don’t listen.”</p><p>He shrugged and opened the fridge. Pulled out a six-pack of Budweiser that was one of the only items left inside. Handed a can to Dean, one to Sam and took one for himself, then shoved some of the debris on the counter aside to make room for the remaining three cans.</p><p>“What about you?” Sam asked, gesturing at the mound of dishes. “Your arms broken? Don’t know how to operate a faucet?”</p><p>He looked at Sam with an expression of baffled scorn, as though Sam had suggested he levitate the plates using psychic powers.</p><p>Dean cracked his can and sucked down a foamy mouthful.</p><p>“You know,” he said. “I really don’t think we ought to be here, in this house. We probably shouldn’t be encouraging the Borderwalker to show up in a residential neighborhood full of innocent families. What if she goes off like she did with that truckful of immigrants? What if Claudia comes home?”</p><p>“You’re right,” Porcayo said. “I couldn’t let that happen.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “So where should we go?”</p><p>“I work night security in an office building down in Santa Ana,” Porcayo said. “After the cleaning crew goes home, the place is empty until eight the next morning.”</p><p>“What time do you start?”</p><p>“Ten.”</p><p>“Man,” Dean said. “Don’t you ever sleep?”</p><p>Porcayo shook his head ruefully.</p><p>“Not really. I try to take naps between the two jobs, but I get nightmares.”</p><p>Sam looked at his watch.</p><p>“Ten o’clock?” he said. “That’s way too late. We need to go somewhere right now.”</p><p>“We could drive out to the desert,” Dean suggested. “Aren’t Borderwalkers more likely to show up in the desert?”</p><p>“That’s not a bad idea,” Sam said.</p><p>“Listen, guys,” Porcayo said. “Are you sure I shouldn’t go alone? I mean, she wants me, right? Why not just let her have me?”</p><p>“That’s very noble,” Dean said. “But we have no way of knowing if she’ll stop after you and no way of tracking her next victim. This could be our last chance to take her out. Now maybe you feel like you deserve to die for what you did, but those poor people in that truck didn’t deserve what happened to them. This creature is totally out of control and we need to stop it.”</p><p>Porcayo hung his head and put his untouched beer down on the counter.</p><p>“I understand, but...” he began.</p><p>There was a small sound from the living room. A padded thump like something fell over and landed on the carpet.</p><p>“Do you have a cat?” Sam asked.</p><p>Porcayo shook his head.</p><p>Dean stepped in front of Porcayo and put his hand on the frame of the doorway leading back into the living room. The bright striped sofa had four huge, parallel gashes across the seat cushions, puffs of fuzzy white stuffing bulging out. The paperback romance novel had fallen to the floor.</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Oh come on,” Dean said. “Couldn’t you just wait a few more minutes?”</p><p>A hand reached up from behind the couch, too many long hairy fingers like spider’s legs clutching the sofa’s back. Then another hand, this one looking oddly dissimilar to the first. There was a low, rumbling growl that sounded more like the Impala’s engine than a living thing. Dean could feel the sound in his bones and the hair on his arms felt suddenly staticy, like there was a free-floating electrical charge in the air.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, unzipping the rifle bag and handing one of the heavy Atzec weapons to him.</p><p>“Where the hell is Xochi?” Dean asked, taking the weapon.</p><p>“Not here, obviously,” Sam said. “Got any other ideas?”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Porcayo said, stepping in front of Dean and through the door to the living room. He said something else in Spanish, his tone emotional and apologetic.</p><p>The Borderwalker leapt up onto the back of the sofa, perching like a vulture, bare taloned feet digging into the cushion. She seemed mostly human, but cadaverous and abnormal in the joints. Limbs asymmetrical and covered in patchy snake scales. Eyes matte-black and terrible. For the first time, Dean noticed the tattoo Ojon had mentioned: a lacy black butterfly on the left side of her scrawny neck. She didn’t seem to have any other ink. Her long, bony jaw dropped to her chin, that now familiar shriek echoing through the room.</p><p>Dean remembered what Xochi had said about connecting emotionally with the Borderwalker’s human soul. How she would be rendered vulnerable to normal weapons. He stepped up beside Porcayo.</p><p>“Listen to him,” Dean said. “He saved your daughter’s life.”</p><p>She looked at Dean with her head tilted like a curious animal. She screamed again and her face shifted first into the face of a coyote, then melted down to a canine skull with only a few shreds of desiccated meat clinging around the empty eye sockets.</p><p>“I don’t think she understands English,” Porcayo said.</p><p>“Then tell her in Spanish,” Dean said to Porcayo. “Tell her how much you love Claudia.”</p><p>Porcayo took another step closer to the Borderwalker, hands held palm up, voice soft and calm as he spoke gently to her in Spanish. Meanwhile, Sam was slowly inching around the perimeter of the room, that Aztec Louisville Slugger held low and ready to swing.</p><p>The Borderwalker’s face shifted again, back to human, but expressionless, features cold and static. Her curly hair was full of dirty feathers. Dean had no way of knowing if Porcayo was getting through to her or not. Dean’s hands were sweating, making the wooden handle of the Aztec weapon slick in his grip.</p><p>Porcayo took another step, now less that six feet away from the Borderwalker. She could easily pounce on him and tear him to shreds, but he was a rock, utterly fearless. He was a completely different person from the broken man who’d tried to slash his wrists in the breakroom at the HandyMart. Like his whole life had been leading up to this moment. The Borderwalker leaned forward, face a skull again and twisting on a long, vulture’s neck as she hooked her long claws into her own chest, tearing at her skin and opening up her ribcage like a book. Inside was a deep, impossible hole, a bottomless well, slick red walls crawling with fire ants. Looking into that hole made Dean feel like he was looking down from the top of a skyscraper. He felt inexplicably sure that he was about to fall into her and had to resist the powerful urge to grab onto something to keep himself from plummeting. That’s when the front door opened.</p><p>“Dad?”</p><p>Claudia stood in the doorway, keys in one hand and a blue raspberry Slurpee in the other.</p><p>The Borderwalker’s skeletal canine head whipped around at the sound of Claudia’s voice. When the Borderwalker saw her daughter, all the monstrosity sluiced off of her like rainwater, leaving behind an ordinary human woman in dusty jeans and a black sweatshirt. She reached out an ordinary hand toward Claudia. Dean could see amazed recognition lighting up Claudia’s eyes.</p><p>“Mama?” Claudia whispered.</p><p>Sam was right there beside the Borderwalker with the obsidian-studded weapon, raising it for a decapitating swing. Claudia saw what he was about to do.</p><p>“NO!” she screamed.</p><p>Claudia dropped the Slurpee and ran to her real mother, throwing her body in between the Borderwalker and Sam. Sam had to check his swing at the very last second to avoid hitting the sobbing teenager.</p><p>For a split second, no one seemed to know what to do. Dean had his own weapon raised but didn’t know what he was going to do with it. He tried to think of something to say to make Claudia understand why they couldn’t let her mother live, but he couldn’t find any words. In that moment, he wasn’t really sure he knew why himself.</p><p>Then Dean heard a gunshot. He swore and spun toward the sound, weapon at the ready. It took him a second to spot the bullet hole in the large picture window. When he turned back toward the Borderwalker, he saw Porcayo take a crooked, staggering step toward him. There was a perfect, bloodless hole just above Porcayo’s right eye. He looked surprised and slightly confused, like he was trying to remember the name of a song playing on a distant radio. He took another step, stumbling like a drunk, and then fell to the carpet.</p><p>Before Dean could react, there was another volley of multiple-caliber gunshots, followed by something crashing through the window. Dean leapt reflexively back from the flying glass and saw to his amazement that the something was a woman. A leggy brunette with the lean, sinewy build of a long distance runner. She wore a thin, filmy dress that had been torn to shreds. Her feet were bare.</p><p>She immediately rolled into a crouch, eyes wide and hair studded with glittering shards of broken glass.</p><p>“Wow, are you okay?” Sam asked, taking a step closer to her.</p><p>She hissed at Sam, flashing a mouthful of blood-webbed canine teeth, and leapt at him. As she lunged, she shifted so that by the time she connected with Sam, she was no longer human, but rather an enormous snarling panther. The heavy Aztec weapon was unwieldy for close combat, and Sam furiously wrestled with the beast, trying to kick it back far enough to take a decent swing.</p><p>“What the...” Dean managed to say, but was interrupted by Xochi appearing in the broken frame of the window.</p><p>“Dean,” she cried. “Silver!”</p><p>She had marigolds in her hair again and a pistol in each hand, firing with one while simultaneously tossing the other to Dean. Dean didn’t need to be told twice.</p><p>Xochi’s shot had hit the panther woman in the chest and she dropped, shifting as she fell. She was human again by the time she hit the carpet. Xochi stepped up and followed up with an efficient double tap to the fallen shifter’s head, but there were three more women coming in fast behind her, all in various stages of transformation. Two of them had guns, firing at the brothers as they ran.</p><p>Dean pushed over a large bookshelf for cover and hit the carpet behind it. He picked off one of the shifters with Xochi’s pistol while another rolled and dove behind the sofa. The Borderwalker reacted suddenly and violently to this strange invasion, tearing loose from Claudia’s embrace and sprouting a thousand scorpion tails, face split open into a howling pit.</p><p>“Sam,” Dean cried. “Claudia!”</p><p>Sam was already on it, pushing Claudia behind him and letting one of the panther women have it with the Aztec weapon. The screeching shifter fell into the coffee table, snapping it in half. Dean finished her with the last silver bullet in the clip.</p><p>“Out!” he called to Xochi, holding up the empty gun where she could see it.</p><p>She wordlessly pulled a second magazine from one of her pockets and tossed it to Dean. He released the empty and caught the full clip in mid-air, snapping it smoothly into place just in time to fire at the third panther woman. At that point, two more shifters had joined the fray, one going after Sam while the other hung back in the empty window frame, taking potshots at Dean and Xochi. Meanwhile, the Borderwalker was attacking Porcayo’s corpse, screaming with unhinged, irrational fury.</p><p>Xochi dove across the room and behind the fallen bookshelf, pressing herself up against the wall beside Dean and swapping out her own spent magazine.</p><p>“It’s good to see you, Dean,” she said.</p><p>“You too,” Dean said. “But who are your little friends?</p><p>They aren’t Borderwalkers are they?”</p><p>“Nagual,” Xochi said. “They are helping Teo, but I’m not sure why.”</p><p>“So who else is on the guest list for this little shindig?” Dean asked. “Dracula maybe, or the Creature from the Black Lagoon? Or how about Hitler? Because I don’t know about you, but I think this party could use a few more monsters.”</p><p>“Well...” Xochi began.</p><p>That’s when Teo walked in through the broken picture window.</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>What happened next happened so fast it made Dean’s head spin.</p><p>Teo leapt on the Borderwalker’s back, but instead of ganking her with the obsidian knife, she spoke a rapid gush of words that seemed to form into glowing blue strands, snaring the writhing Borderwalker like a spider’s web.</p><p>The ceiling above them split wide open, gaping like a hungry gullet and Teo and the Borderwalker fell toward it, spiraling impossibly upward into the void. There was a sound like a thunderclap, like a sonic boom, and they were both gone. The two remaining shifters did a quick fade, transforming into doe deer and taking off through the broken window.</p><p>For a few heartbeats, there was just silence in the room as the three hunters waited to see what would happen next. Nothing did.</p><p>“What the hell just happened?” Sam asked, checking out a couple of nasty claw-marks on his forearm. He grabbed a crumpled red tablecloth and pressed it to the bleeding wounds.</p><p>“Teo has saddled the Borderwalker,” Xochi said. “Rode her through the gate into the Borderland between worlds.”</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, frowning and handing Xochi’s pistol back to her. “Why?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Xochi said, holstering both the pistols. “But I do know this. The Borderwalker’s power to transport people and things goes both ways. She can also bring things from the worlds beyond through the Borderland and into our world. I think maybe Teo is planning to unleash something ancient and terrible. We have to find a way to stop her.”</p><p>“This job’s too hard,” Dean said to Sam. “Let’s be firemen instead.”</p><p>Sam laughed, shaking his head.</p><p>“Where is Claudia?” Xochi asked.</p><p>They found her huddled underneath an end table, knees tucked up under her chin and eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>“Are you all right?” Xochi asked gently, offering Claudia her hand.</p><p>“Don’t touch me,” the girl responded.</p><p>“We need to get out of here,” Xochi said. “Now.”</p><p>Claudia started crying, face buried in her hands.</p><p>Xochi looked up at Dean. He could see that she was silently asking him to do something to comfort Claudia, but he wasn’t any better at nursing the wounded than she was. Dean had never considered himself the boo-boo kissing type. Normally Dean would have relied on Sam for that kind of emotional aftercare, but in his current soulless state his brother was worse than useless in that department.</p><p>“Listen, kid,” Dean began, kneeling down awkwardly beside her.</p><p>Claudia threw her arms around him, sobbing against his chest.</p><p>“Yeah, well...” He patted her back awkwardly, looking up at Xochi. Xochi gave him an encouraging thumbs-up. “Okay, come on, let’s get you out of here.”</p><p>He stood slowly and she stood with him, clinging to him like she was drowning. Xochi and Sam both headed for the broken window frame, Xochi waving for Dean to follow. Dean lifted Claudia in his arms and carried her through the debris, wreckage and bloody carnage that used to be her home.</p><p>When he got out to the Impala, his arms full of sobbing teenager, he just stood for a moment, unable to let go of her to get the keys from his pocket.</p><p>“I’ll drive,” Xochi said. “Where are your keys?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. “Look, nothing personal, but I don’t really like other people driving my car.”</p><p>Dean could hear sirens in the distance.</p><p>“Unless you plan to drive with her in your lap,” Xochi said with an arched eyebrow, “you’d better change that policy.”</p><p>Dean looked over to Sam, who raised his swaddled arm and shrugged. He was clearly way too amused by this exchange to offer any help.</p><p>“Right front pocket,” Dean said eventually. “But don’t touch the stereo.”</p><p>He lifted Claudia a little higher in his arms so that Xochi could reach into his pocket, trying not to think about how weird and uncomfortable this felt.</p><p>Xochi unlocked the Impala’s doors and Dean tried to put Claudia down in the back seat, but she clung to him with panicked desperation and he had no choice but to get into the back seat with her. Sam got in the front passenger seat and Xochi slipped behind the wheel.</p><p>Xochi revved the Impala and put her in gear, pulling away from the curb. Dean had to resist the urge to watch the road and lecture Xochi on her driving. After a while, Claudia slowly started to wind down, easing up on the death grip she had on Dean. He looked down and saw that the front of his shirt was smeared with black blotches from her runny eyeliner.</p><p>“You okay?” he asked her.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“Would you be?” she asked.</p><p>“Believe me, I’ve been there,” he said.</p><p>She was looking up at him, black make-up running down her chubby cheeks and eyes narrow and suspicious.</p><p>“I lost both my parents to this kind of action,” Dean told her.</p><p>“What?” Claudia looked away, tears welling back up again. “That’s supposed to make me feel better?”</p><p>“I’m just saying,” Dean told her. “You don’t always get to choose what happens to you and your family, but you can choose how you react. Know what I mean? You can either let it chew you up or you can keep fighting no matter what. I chose to keep fighting. Now it’s your turn to choose.”</p><p>Dean could see that his words were getting through to her, but he could also see they were having another, unfortunate side effect. Now she was looking up at him with big puppy-dog eyes.</p><p>“Hey Xochi,” Dean said, pulling his hand away from Claudia and stuffing it into his pocket. “Why don’t you pull into that diner. I think we really need to talk some stuff over. Figure out our next move. There’s no point just driving around aimlessly.”</p><p>Really, he just wanted to get out of the back seat and Claudia’s adoring gaze.</p><p>“No problem,” Xochi said, hitting the turn signal.</p><p>She pulled into the first available slot in the parking lot, killed the ignition and tossed the keys to Dean.</p><p>“Thanks for trusting me to drive,” she said. “It was a real pleasure. This is a beautiful car.”</p><p>“Don’t get used to it,” Dean said, pocketing the keys.</p><p>This diner was called “ORBIT BURGER,” a mid-century classic, all futuristic angles and atomic-age details. The sign was shaped like a rocket ship and the décor inside continued the space-faring theme.</p><p>The four of them took a table all the way in the back, as far away from other patrons as they could get. Claudia sat beside Dean in the booth and so Xochi sat opposite her.</p><p>Sam took off into the men’s room with a first-aid kit while the other three stared at the menus and didn’t speak. In the end, none of them actually felt like eating, so they just got coffee. Claudia asked for a chocolate milkshake but then barely touched it. When Sam returned with a neat, white bandage on his arm, he slid into the booth beside Xochi.</p><p>Xochi was intensely relieved to be reunited with Dean and Sam. She’d felt sure from the beginning that they needed to stick together and now more than ever, she knew that was true. It had been a hell of a fight trying to make her way back to them. Teo’s pet Nagual were on her the whole way, hounding her and thwarting her at every turn. What had her sister got herself into?</p><p>“Where to begin?” Xochi asked. “This is such a mess.”</p><p>“First things first,” Dean said. “Claudia, where can we take you? Someplace safe, grandparents or friends maybe?”</p><p>“I’m not a child,” she said. “I’m not going to Grandma’s house, I’m going to find my real mother.”</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Dean said. “You can’t...”</p><p>“I can,” Claudia said. “She’s all I have left.”</p><p>“There’s no way...” Dean began.</p><p>“It’s my choice,” Claudia said. She turned to Dean. “I choose, right? You said so yourself.”</p><p>“Claudia,” Dean said. “You have no idea...”</p><p>“Don’t I?” Claudia picked up her napkin, shredding the edge with a chipped black fingernail. “I know where she is right now. I’ve always known. And if you won’t help me get to her, then I’ll go alone.”</p><p>“You know where she is now?” Sam asked. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Ever since I was little, I’ve had these...” Claudia looked down at the shredded napkin. “They’re like dreams, but they don’t always come when I’m sleeping. We have a bond. I can’t really explain it. It’s like I can see her, my real mother, inside my mind. Her name is Elvia. I bet you didn’t know that. Elvia Revueltas.”</p><p>“No,” Dean said. “We didn’t know that.”</p><p>“For the longest time,” Claudia continued. “She was lost. Wandering alone, scared and hurting. Then I saw her in Choulic. In San Diego. In Yuma. She was so angry. So angry. I never told anyone about her. They would just say I’m crazy, but I’m not, am I?”</p><p>“So where is she now?” Sam asked.</p><p>Claudia looked at Sam with a hard frown.</p><p>“What, you want me to tell you where she is so you can kill her?”</p><p>“I’m sorry, but we have no choice,” Xochi said. “What your mother has become, it’s unnatural. She needs to be put down, like a sick dog. You have to help us find her.”</p><p>“No,” Claudia said. “Tell them Dean, there’s always a choice. Isn’t there? Isn’t there?”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer. He had no idea what to say.</p><p>“Screw you people,” Claudia said, standing up. “I’m not helping you kill my mom!”</p><p>An old Mexican man a few booths down looked up over the edge of his Spanish newspaper at Dean and Claudia, frowning.</p><p>“Keep your voice down,” Dean said.</p><p>“Okay, just hang on a second,” Sam said. “Please, sit down. I think I have an idea.”</p><p>Claudia paused warily, then sat cautiously on the edge of the booth, ready to bolt.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said. “Remember when you got turned into a vampire?”</p><p>Claudia’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Dean said, hard stare locked on Sam with half-buried fury flashing in his eyes. “I remember.”</p><p>“You’re a vampire?” Claudia asked, like she hadn’t heard anything else.</p><p>Xochi could see that Claudia was rapidly developing a massive crush on Dean. The rush of teenage hormones flooding the booth was thicker than the greasy smoke coming off the grill in the kitchen.</p><p>“Whoa, hold on,” Dean said. “First of all, being a vampire isn’t sexy, okay? Not even a little bit. I’m dead serious. It was one of the worst things that’s ever happened to me, and I’ve been to Hell so you better believe I know what I’m talking about. Second, I’m not a vampire anymore, because...”</p><p>He looked up at Sam, suddenly understanding.</p><p>“You think there’s a way we can cure the Borderwalker?”</p><p>Dean turned to Xochi. “Is that possible?” he asked. “To turn the Borderwalker back into a normal human?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Xochi said. “But I know who would. Huehuecoyotl. If he can tell us how to transform her back into a human, then she will be unable to open a gate between the worlds. She will be useless to Teo.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “So we talk this coyote dude into giving us a way to cure the Borderwalker, but we’ll still need to find her.”</p><p>“I think she’s in Mexico,” Claudia said. “Somewhere close to the border, but not Tijuana. I don’t know where that woman is taking her, but she’s very scared and confused. Promise me you won’t hurt her. Please?”</p><p>“I cannot promise that,” Xochi said. “I won’t lie to you, but I can promise to try this other plan first. If we fail, we may have no other choice. This hunt has become so much bigger than simply putting a suffering animal out of its misery. I think my sister is using the Borderwalker for something big. Something terrible.”</p><p>There was silence for a moment at the table. Xochi could see the gravity of her words sinking in for Claudia but also for Dean. Claudia looked terrified and unsure. Dean just looked grim and determined.</p><p>“How about the panther chicks?” Dean asked. “Where do they fit into all this?”</p><p>“The Nagual are a race of shapeshifting witches,” Xochi said. “Both male and female. They can take on various animal forms, but cannot imitate other humans. Not all are evil; it depends on which gods or goddesses they serve. Why they are helping Teo capture the Borderwalker remains to be seen.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “Next step?”</p><p>“We should go to Mexico, find my sister and the Borderwalker,” Xochi said. “We can find a place to talk to Huehuecoyotl along the way. But first...” She turned to Claudia. “I need to ask you something important.”</p><p>“Okay,” Claudia said.</p><p>“What do you know about the night of your real mother’s death?”</p><p>“Xochi, come on,” Dean said. “Do we have to get into that right now?”</p><p>“I have my reasons,” Xochi told him. “Please, Claudia, it’s important.”</p><p>“Nothing,” Claudia said. “All I know is that she died trying to cross the border. We have this... I don’t know what to call it, this weird kind of link, but I can’t see anything about what happened to her that night. It’s like she’s blocking that part from me.”</p><p>Xochi closed her eyes, pressing her fingers into her temples. She really wished there was some other way to do this. With everything else that Claudia was going through, she didn’t need be confronted with her father’s awful secret.</p><p>“I’m so sorry to ask you this,” Xochi said. “But I need information about what happened to your mother, and there are only two people who witnessed her unnatural transformation. One of them is dead, by his own hand. The other is you.”</p><p>“Me?” Claudia frowned. “But I was just a baby. I don’t remember anything about that night.”</p><p>“You don’t consciously remember,” Xochi said. “But the memories are there inside your head. I can help you access them if you agree to let me in. I think there is a larger force behind what is happening to your mother. If I can see exactly what went wrong that night, it will help us find who is responsible. Find them and stop them.”</p><p>“All right,” Claudia said quietly. “What do I have to do?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I don’t know about this,” Dean said over his shoulder.</p><p>He was back in the driver’s seat, where he clearly belonged. Sam rode shotgun, as usual. Xochi was in the Impala’s back seat with Claudia. She felt more than a little apprehensive about linking minds with the young girl, but she also knew that the world was full of hurt and heartbreak. No one could be protected from that ugly truth forever.</p><p>Xochi herself was hunting full time by the time she was Claudia’s age, staring death in the face every single day. More than that, Xochi was beginning to understand that Claudia was going to be a critical piece of the puzzle. As important to the success of the hunt as Sam. Maybe even more important.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Claudia said.</p><p>Xochi hoped she was right.</p><p>“Just remember,” Dean said. “Your dad—he was a good person. He saved your life. What you see that night, it wasn’t really him, okay?”</p><p>“Whatever,” Claudia said. “I’m fine.” She turned to Xochi. “I’m ready.”</p><p>Xochi gently cupped the back of Claudia’s head, pressing her palm to the girl’s forehead.</p><p>“This may feel... strange,” Xochi told her. “Don’t fight it, just try to relax.”</p><p>Then she began to recite the spell, easing her way slowly in.</p><p>The first thing Xochi encountered was a flood of memories, not of the Borderwalker, but of Irma, Claudia’s adopted mother. A woman with kind hazel eyes and gentle hands. Thick brown hair swept up into a simple twist at the nape of her long neck. A heart-shaped locket on a gold chain. She had an almost ethereal beauty, delicate, girlish and a little too thin, but always smiling. She stood in the kitchen with Claudia’s grandmother, cooking a huge pot of menudo on Sunday after church. In the backyard wearing a yellow dress, laughing and raising a hand to shade her eyes from the sun. In the living room, reading on the couch with her slim legs curled up underneath her, holding the book far away from her eyes because she refused to “throw money away” on new reading glasses when the ones she had were “perfectly fine.” In Claudia’s room, helping her make tea for dolls. Her father was there too, winking and pointing to his scratchy cheek, asking for a kiss. Lifting her up so high, seeming impossibly big and strong. Teaching her funny songs with bad words in them and her mother chasing him out of the kitchen with a wooden spoon. Him taking her mother’s hand and kissing it.</p><p>There were also memories of her mother in the hospital. A skeleton in pink terrycloth, barely breathing and lost in morphine haze. Claudia standing there nauseous and wracked with guilt for wanting to run away. For not wanting to touch that cold, wasted hand. For wishing she’d just hurry up and die already.</p><p>Xochi worked her way backwards, moving like liquid flowing through the years. As the memories got older, they became more disjointed, non-linear. Flashes and blurred images that Xochi had to pick apart and decipher. When she came upon what seemed to be a memory of being tucked inside a zipped-up windbreaker, she decided to dig deeper. There were other feelings associated with this memory, warmth and safety and a smell of drugstore aftershave. She worked through the tangled strands of this memory and into what preceded it. That was where she found what she was looking for.</p><p>Claudia is alone. Alone and cold and frightened in the middle of the night. Sand under her cheek and scratchy branches and curious insects and she wants to cry but is petrified, frozen in terror. Men are running, huge boots thundering past the place where she is hidden. The men’s eyes are all wrong, hot and glowing from within, like cinders. She can see Elvia, her mother. The men are hurting her, kicking her and tearing her clothes. Doing other things that Claudia doesn’t understand.</p><p>Xochi breathed a sign of relief when she realized that the men in Claudia’s memory are just looming monstrous shapes. She carefully kept her own thoughts about the unfolding scene to herself, trying to stay detached as she watched and waited.</p><p>The men seem to be finished with Elvia. They step away, one by one, but the last man reaches down and touches her. Touches Elvia on the neck and a terrible dark stain forms, like an inky bruise. The stain takes the shape of wings. A butterfly.</p><p>A cold, creeping dread surged through Xochi’s veins. How could she have missed all the signs? How could she have been so blind when the answer was right there all along?</p><p>The men walk away, heads hung low and eyes no longer glowing, slump-shouldered shadows disappearing into the night. Then, a woman. A tall, silent woman with no clothes on. The woman crouches over Elvia, comforting her and whispering, shifting fluidly from human to coyote and back again. Elvia reaches out to take the woman’s hand and the black butterfly on her neck begins to spread like a disease across her pale skin, ugly barbed tendrils that reach out to infect the coyote woman. There is a hole opening in the night sky, a huge pulsing wound between the stars. The coyote woman lets out a shriek of unbearable agony as the black tendrils begin to eat into her flesh like acid, exposing raw, smoking bone. A torrential gush of strange power is flowing like blood from the coyote woman and into Elvia’s convulsing body as the two of them slowly levitate into the air, falling away from the bloody sand beneath them. Then the coyote woman bursts into a shower of wet black rags that disintegrate before they hit the sand and Elvia disappears into the wound in the sky, a long crooning howl echoing through the desert night.</p><p>Then the big man in the windbreaker, and Claudia zipped up safely inside.</p><p>Xochi fought to keep her breathing calm and steady as she gently withdrew, disengaging herself from Claudia’s memory. She came slowly back to herself in the back seat of the Impala, taking her hand off Claudia’s forehead. The girl’s smeary soot-ringed eyes flickered, then opened.</p><p>“Trippy,” she said. “Was that real?”</p><p>“I’m afraid so,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Well?” Sam asked.</p><p>“It is so much worse than I thought,” Xochi told him.</p><p>“So,” Dean said. “Let’s hear it.”</p><p>“It is Itzpapalotl,” Xochi told them. Just saying the name out loud made her skin crawl. “The Clawed Butterfly. Queen of the Tzitzimimeh.”</p><p>Dean didn’t know what he was hoping to hear from Xochi about her spelunking into Claudia’s head, but that definitely wasn’t it.</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Dean said. “These zee-zee... whatdayacallits, aren’t they those Star Demons you told us about? The soul-eaters?”</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “Those are the ones. And Itzpapalotl is the most powerful of them all. It was she who possessed those men and made them rape Elvia. It was she who put her unclean mark on the dying woman’s neck so that her rage would be intensified and her transformation corrupted. I believe she is planning to use Elvia’s unnatural power to transport her and her sisters through the Borderland and into our world. The Nagual helping Teo are obviously her servants.”</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Claudia said. “Who were those men who attacked my mother? Are those the men she’s been hunting?”</p><p>“Oh boy,” Dean said softly under his breath. “Here we go.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Sam said, oblivious to the awkwardness.</p><p>“Well, then why did she come after my dad?”</p><p>Dean looked at Claudia in the rearview mirror. She wasn’t stupid. He could see in her face that she already knew the answer to her own question.</p><p>No one said anything. They didn’t have to.</p><p>“Remember what I told you,” Dean said. “Your father saved your life. Hell, he saved all our lives today. He’s a good man. What happened that night wasn’t his fault.”</p><p>Dean took one more look in the rearview. Claudia’s expression was conflicted, but he knew that there was nothing he more he could do for her. She’d either find a way to come to terms with what her father had done, or she else wouldn’t and there was nothing that Dean could say that change that. So he changed the subject instead.</p><p>“So, Xochi,” he said. “Where does your crazy sister fit into all of this?”</p><p>Xochi took a breath. “My family has always worshiped the moon goddess Coyolxauhqui,” she explained. “All female children are dedicated to her from birth, including Teo. But when she wasn’t chosen to be the head of the family, she renounced Coyolxauhqui and all things relating to the spiritual realm. She said she cared only for the carnal pleasures of this life. I will never forgive her for what she did, but I still can’t imagine her becoming involved with something as loathsome and deadly as the Tzitzimimeh. Teo is not evil, she is just misguided.”</p><p>“I realize that she’s family and all,” Dean said. “But I got news for you. If she’s an active part of a plan to ferry these Star Demons into our world, that’s straight-up evil my book.”</p><p>“I’m with Dean on this,” Sam said. “Just a scratch from a dead one’s tooth almost killed my brother. What’s gonna happen when we have a whole pack of these things on the loose? And not only will we have the Tzitzimimeh to contend with, but we’ll also have all their soulless, zombified victims running around. Am I right?”</p><p>“Right,” Xochi said. “It would be the end of civilization as we know it.”</p><p>“End of civilization as we know it?” Dean asked. “Sam, didn’t we just stop an apocalypse last Tuesday? There’s gotta be a quota for that kind of thing, right? You know, one per family?”</p><p>Dean glanced in the rearview mirror and caught a glimpse of Xochi’s face. She wasn’t laughing.</p><p>“Okay, before we start waxing apocalyptic,” Dean said. “A more practical question. Where are we going, exactly?”</p><p>“We need to cross the border,” Xochi said. “Not Tijuana. Nogales, I think would be best. I have a friend there who can help us.”</p><p>“I’m tired,” Claudia said in a very small voice.</p><p>Dean’s head was so full of everything he’d just learned that he had almost forgotten she was there. They had to be crazy bringing a young girl like her into a dangerous hunt like this. But without her, he realized, they would never be able to find the Borderwalker in time to stop her from opening the gate for the Clawed Butterfly and her minions. They had to face that Claudia could get killed on this hunt or wait and get killed along with the rest of the human race once the Star Demons had been unleashed. But the fact that they didn’t seem to have a choice didn’t make the idea of something happening to Claudia on Dean’s watch any more appealing.</p><p>“Get some sleep, kid,” Dean said to Claudia. “It’s gonna be a long drive.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-28">CHAPTER 28</span><a href="#chapter-28" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean stopped for gas just outside Yuma. Sam got out to stretch his legs and Xochi headed off to the ladies’ room. Claudia was still out like a light in the back seat. She’d been through so much; her young mind had obviously tapped out. Dean didn’t have the heart to wake her.</p><p>“Want anything?” Dean asked Sam.</p><p>“No, thanks,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean went into the minimart and walked over to the coffee machine, pulling a large cup from the dispenser below. Xochi came up next to him, taking a cup for herself.</p><p>“Milk?” she asked Dean, holding out a handful of single-serve half-and-half containers.</p><p>Dean shook his head, filling his cup to the rim with steaming black brew. He watched with amazement as Xochi dumped the contents of a half a dozen of the little containers into her own empty cup, followed by an equally ridiculous amount of sugar.</p><p>“Want some coffee to go with your milk and sugar?” he asked, holding out the carafe.</p><p>“Just a little,” she replied, offering him her cup. “I suppose you think you’re more tough than me because you don’t put sugar in your coffee.”</p><p>“No,” Dean said. “I’m tougher than you because I know all the lyrics to ‘Eye of the Tiger.’”</p><p>“Yeah?” Xochi said. “Well, I know all the lines from Die Hard. In English and in Spanish.”</p><p>“I once ganked a demon with a match book and a handful of pocket change.”</p><p>“Last week I killed six mummies with my chonies,” she said. “And I was wearing them at the time.”</p><p>“Chonies?”</p><p>“You know, panties.”</p><p>“Damn,” Dean said. “You win.”</p><p>“Good.” Xochi smiled. “Then you buy the coffee, tough guy.”</p><p>Dean laughed and fished out his wallet.</p><p>When they got back out to the Impala, Sam was leaning against the back passenger door.</p><p>“Xochi,” Sam said. “Why don’t you ride up front with Dean for a while? I’ve got a bunch of info here on the Tzitzimimeh. I really ought to go over this stuff and see if I can find anything that’ll help us.”</p><p>Dean could see what Sam really was doing, pushing him at Xochi again, but he couldn’t be bothered to argue. It’s not like Sam was exactly a font of scintillating conversation these days anyway and it wouldn’t suck to have someone to talk to for the rest of drive.</p><p>Sam settled into the back seat with his laptop and Xochi got in up front. When she reached for the stereo, Dean swatted her hand away.</p><p>“Hey, what did I tell you?” Dean asked. “My car, my tunes, okay? Don’t like it, buy yourself some ear plugs.”</p><p>“Why don’t you sing ‘Eye of the Tiger’ for me?”</p><p>“Careful what you wish for,” Dean said, pulling out of the gas station.</p><p>He turned on the radio. Led Zeppelin’s “Rock and Roll.”</p><p>“See, there you go,” he said.</p><p>Xochi grinned.</p><p>“That’s just what I would have picked,” she said.</p><p>To his surprise, she started singing along. Her singing voice was actually pretty good, powerful and a little husky, like whisky and cream.</p><p>“Been a long time, been a long time...”</p><p>Dean joined in with her, unable to kill the big dumb smile on his face.</p><p>“Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, time,” they sang together.</p><p>“Come on, Dean,” Sam said from the back seat. Dean could see him rolling his eyes in the rearview. “Do we really need to listen to the theme song for your sexual frustration?”</p><p>“Led Zeppelin?” Claudia said, turning her head against the window and covering her face with one arm. “Ugh! That’s like total grandpa music.”</p><p>“Grandpa music?” Dean said. “Look, you two chuckleheads can walk to Nogales.”</p><p>“What?” Sam asked. “If we don’t shut up, you’re gonna turn this car right around?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Dean said. “And no ice cream for either one of you.”</p><p>Dean looked over at Xochi. Her dark eyes were full of mirth, lips curled up in one corner. He shook his head and pulled back onto the highway.</p><p>In the back seat, Sam plugged a pair of earbud-style headphones into his laptop and handed them to Claudia. She put them in and smiled. Dean didn’t even want to know what kind of musical atrocity was being perpetrated back there. “Rock and Roll” ended on the Impala’s stereo and Cream’s “Sunshine of Your Love” came on.</p><p>“Has it really been that long?” Xochi asked, sipping her coffee.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You know.”</p><p>“No,” Dean said, answering way too fast. “I mean, not really, no.”</p><p>“Okay,” Xochi said, shrugging.</p><p>He looked up in the rearview at Sam. Sam met his gaze for a second, eyebrow raised, before looking back down at the screen of the laptop without comment. His silence was somehow more damning than a snarky retort. Dean had no idea why the whole world had taken a sudden avid interest in his sex life, or lack thereof.</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi asked. “What did you mean before, when you were talking about stopping an apocalypse?”</p><p>“Long story,” Dean said. “But I tell you what. If we succeed in stopping this one, I promise, I’ll buy you a dozen drinks and make you sorry you ever asked.”</p><p>When they finally arrived in Nogales, Arizona, Xochi directed them into a neighborhood that may as well have been on the other side of the border. Dean spotted where they were going before Xochi pointed it out.</p><p>Chevy Atzeca. A body shop. The entire wall in front of the place was painted with an enormous mural that depicted a hopping ‘64 Impala with angel wings, a crying woman in a fedora and the words Bajito y Suavecito in ghostly white script. The large metal gate was open, and there was a group of bald, heavily tattooed gangbanger types hanging around in the driveway, eyeballing Dean as he pulled up. One of the young men had a huge blue-gray pitbull on a heavy chain and a gun butt protruding from his waistband</p><p>“I don’t like this,” Sam said from the back seat.</p><p>“Relax,” Xochi said. “These guys are on our side.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like it either. After all his dire warnings to Sam not to trust Xochi and keep an eye on her to make sure she didn’t try to screw them over, he was starting to seriously wonder if that wasn’t exactly what she had done.</p><p>The guy with the dog strolled over to Dean’s window, lifting his goateed chin in an acknowledgment so subtle it was almost unperceptable. The dog sat at his master’s side, looking up at Dean with his wide pink tongue out and a dumb, friendly expression that was seriously undermining the whole tough-guy routine.</p><p>“‘Sup, Xochi,” the guy said. He had a heavy accent and spoke like a ventriloquist, lips barely moving. “This Dean Winchester?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Xochi said. “Dean, this is Lil’ Sleepy.”</p><p>“How you doing?” Dean said. He made himself smile, trying to stay relaxed and casual. The temptation to crack a Snow White joke was almost unbearable, but he somehow managed to keep his trap shut.</p><p>“Nice ride,” Lil’ Sleepy said. “Go on in.”</p><p>Dean pulled in. The sullen bangers cleared out of their way and then shut the gate behind them.</p><p>Although the neighborhood was questionable at best and the outside of the building dilapidated, everything inside the body shop was top of the line, tricked to the nines. In addition to all the standard equipment: compressors, oxy/acetylene torches, and MIG welders, they also had a computer-programmable tubing bender, an automatic tungsten-carbide cold saw, and a brand-new five-station hydraulic ironworker. With equipment like that, they could pretty much build a whole car from scratch. No wonder they had a bunch of armed guys hanging around in the driveway. Just that saw alone was probably worth around a hundred grand.</p><p>“You sure about these guys?” Dean asked Xochi quietly.</p><p>“Of course I’m sure,” Xochi said, looking mildly offended. “I trust Chato with my life. He’s a good friend. Works on cars for all the border-town hunters I know. Engines too, not just bodywork.”</p><p>“Chato?”</p><p>A stocky, sawed-off Mexican guy in a grease-stained coverall walked up to Dean’s window. He was five-foot-four tops, but he had the single most astounding pompadour hairdo Dean had ever seen. It had to be at least six inches tall, slick and shiny as black glass. He was wiping his filthy hands on a rag, hands that were easily as big as Sam’s, if not bigger, and looked weirdly disproportionate on the ends of his short, stubby arms. A name patch on the breast of his coverall read CHATO.</p><p>“Beautiful,” he said, eyeballing the Impala like she was a naked playmate.</p><p>“Dean, Sam, Claudia,” Xochi said. “This is Chato Aguilar.”</p><p>“Pleasure to meet a fellow Chevrolet enthusiast,” Dean said.</p><p>“327?” Chato asked, hand on the hood.</p><p>“Of course,” Dean replied.</p><p>Chato squatted down and peered underneath the back end of the car with a penlight.</p><p>“Your skid plates are looking a little worn,” Chato asked. “I could take care of that for you. Hook you up with some sick hoppers too. Just charge you for parts. Any friend of Xochi’s...”</p><p>“Nah,” Dean said. “You know what? I’m good. I’m more of a do-it-yourself kinda guy.”</p><p>“What we need is a place to crash for a few hours,” Xochi said. “And a safe place to leave Dean’s car while we’re down south.”</p><p>“You got it,” he said. “My shop es tu casa. Ashley!”</p><p>A bouncy, freckled and slightly buck-toothed blonde in tiny cut-off shorts sauntered in and gave Xochi a big hug, speaking rapid-fire Spanish even though she was clearly white as Wonder Bread. She was also hugely pregnant.</p><p>“My wife Ashley,” Chato said to Dean.</p><p>“Ma’am,” Dean said.</p><p>“Hi,” she said with a toothy smile. “You guys hungry? We got the grill going out back.”</p><p>“Sounds fantastic,” Dean said.</p><p>“Thanks,” Sam said.</p><p>Claudia didn’t say anything. She still seemed kind of shut down, moving like an automaton.</p><p>“You hungry, kid?” Dean asked her.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>Ashley came over to Claudia, a concerned, motherly look on her face.</p><p>“You okay, honey?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m tired,” Claudia said.</p><p>“Lemme get a bed made up for you,” Ashley said, putting an arm around the girl. “The rest of you, go on out back. Grab a couple of beers and help yourself to some carné asada.”</p><p>Dean was tremendously relieved to have someone with real mom-skills take over the job of dealing with the traumatized teenager. He was more than ready to get back to doing something he was actually good at. Like drinking beer.</p><h2><span id="chapter-29">CHAPTER 29</span><a href="#chapter-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean woke to find himself sprawled out on a sofa with a bare female foot pressed against his cheek. The foot was attached to a slender, tattooed ankle, which in turn was attached to Xochi, fully dressed and currently passed out facing the opposite way on the sofa. She had fallen asleep with her gun-belt on. Dean wondered if he was getting close to some kind of personal record for the number of nights spent sleeping with a woman that he wasn’t actually sleeping with.</p><p>The sofa was inside a small office. Sam sat at the cluttered desk, engine parts and order forms shoved aside to make room for his laptop. Posters of sexy women posed with sexy cars covered the wall behind him. There was a coffee machine sitting on a low table beneath the single window, nearly full and busily belching out fragrant steam. Dean extracted himself from under Xochi’s legs, got himself relatively vertical and shuffled like a zombie toward the coffee.</p><p>“Oh look,” Sam said when he noticed that Dean was up. “It walks among us.”</p><p>Xochi made a low, pained groan and put one of the cushions from the sofa over her head.</p><p>Dean poured coffee into a cup emblazoned with the Lowrider Magazine logo and took a slug.</p><p>“Where’s the john?” he asked.</p><p>“Through there,” Sam said, indicating a doorway on the far side of the room. “But there’s no door.”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said, looking over his shoulder at the semi-conscious Xochi. “Watch her.”</p><p>Dean managed to rid himself of about ten gallons of recycled beer without waking Xochi. When he came back into the office, he saw that she had her eyes open, peering blearily out from under the cushion.</p><p>“You are a bad person, Dean Winchester,” she said, slowing sitting up and pushing her tangled hair back from her face.</p><p>“I’m a bad person?” He walked over to the coffee machine and poured her a cup, loading it up with milk and sugar. “You’re the one who started with the mezcal.”</p><p>He handed her the cup and then topped up his own.</p><p>Xochi reached into her back pocket, pulled out a flat silver flask and added a generous knock to the coffee. She held the flask out to Dean.</p><p>“Hell yeah,” Dean said, offering his cup.</p><p>“Salud,” Xochi said, pouring a shot into his cup.</p><p>Sam made an exasperated noise, shaking his shaggy head.</p><p>“You know, I used to think it was kinda cute how similar you two are,” he said. “Now, not so much. It’s hard enough dealing with one Dean every day.”</p><p>“I’m not like him,” Xochi said, standing and pocketing the flask. “He is like me.”</p><p>“Except,” Dean said, smirking. “Well... you know.” He frowned. “Hey, wait a minute. You’re not really a dude, are you?”</p><p>Xochi laughed.</p><p>“Of course not,” she said. “That’s why I’m clearly the superior version.”</p><p>“I won’t argue with you there,” Dean said. “I like your version better, too.”</p><p>Xochi glanced through the open doorway into the bathroom.</p><p>“Is there no door on the toilet?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said, flapping his hand in the general direction of the other door. “You know what? I’ll just... be out there. Sam? Sam!”</p><p>Sam looked up from his laptop screen.</p><p>“Oh yeah, right,” he stood and followed Dean out into the garage.</p><p>If Dean thought it was hard to leave the Impala at the California border for one night, he was even less thrilled about leaving it with a near stranger for who knew how long.</p><p>“Are you sure about this?” Dean asked Xochi yet again as he watched Chato cover the Impala with a tarp. “I mean, I’m not gonna come back for my car and find she’s got six-inch-tall windows and an Aztec warrior painted on the hood?”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Xochi said. “She is in good hands.”</p><p>Dean believed her, but he still called Bobby and gave him the address of the garage.</p><p>“Just in case,” Dean said into the phone.</p><p>“In case what?” Bobby asked. “In case you go and get your dumb ass killed?”</p><p>“Well, yeah,” Dean said. “Or something like that.”</p><p>“What the hell are you two up to down there anyway?” Bobby asked.</p><p>“Something big,” Dean said. “Don’t wait up.”</p><p>He ended the call.</p><p>Xochi was in the midst of hooking a trailer with two dirt bikes to a beat-up brown Land Rover.</p><p>“Where’d you get these?” Dean asked.</p><p>“The bikes are mine,” Xochi said. “I won them in a poker game a few months back. The Rover...” She shrugged, tipped her chin toward Lil’ Sleepy, who was noisily demonstrating his name, snoring in an old bucket seat propped up against a stack of tires. “It belongs to Lil’ Sleepy. He sold it to me last night for a dollar and a bottle of mezcal. We’d better get going before he wakes up.”</p><p>“Forget I asked,” Dean said. “What are we gonna need dirt bikes for anyway?”</p><p>“We will need to go out into the deep desert to call Huehuecoyotl,” she said. “These will be much faster than hiking, and with the Borderwalker on the move, every minute counts.”</p><p>Claudia appeared from a back room, looking worn and rumpled but determined.</p><p>“How you doing?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Okay, I guess,” she said. She looked Dean over. “Rough night?”</p><p>“What would you know about something like that?”</p><p>She rolled her eyes dramatically.</p><p>“I’m not stupid,” she said. “I’m not a virgin either.”</p><p>“You know what?” Dean said. “I do not need to know that.”</p><p>Sam came out of the office, gear packed up and ready to go.</p><p>“Are we gonna have a problem crossing the border?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Claudia,” Xochi asked. “You have your passport?”</p><p>Claudia nodded.</p><p>“We used to go visit my dad’s relatives in TJ every weekend,” she said. “I always have it.”</p><p>“They are never very concerned with people going out,” Xochi said. “Only coming in.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean asked. “But what about the stolen car?”</p><p>“Stolen car?” Claudia asked.</p><p>She looked impressed. Sam looked annoyed.</p><p>“It’s not stolen,” Xochi said. “I bought it and Ashley did up all our paperwork for us last night. Registration, vehicle permit and tourist card. Mexican insurance. That kind of thing. Anyway that’s not our main problem. Our main problem is that we cannot bring any weapons.”</p><p>“What?” Dean shook his head. “No way.”</p><p>“Listen to me,” Xochi said. “Coming in, they search for drugs and people. Going out, it’s money and guns.”</p><p>“I’m not going into this hunt naked,” Dean said. “That’s just crazy.”</p><p>“I know a guy,” she said. “He’ll hook us up on the other side of the border, but for now, this is the way it has to be.”</p><p>She unbuckled her gun-belt and walked over to the tarped Impala, holding out her hand to Dean for the keys. He reluctantly gave them to her. She pushed back the tarp and popped the trunk, lifting the false bottom and adding her pistols to the rest of the arsenal. Then she held out an empty hand to Dean, fingers curling inward in a “gimme” gesture.</p><p>“Oh no,” Dean said.</p><p>“Oh yes,” Xochi said. “Trust me on this. It would be different if we were crossing on foot, but we need the bikes and CBP is much more careful with vehicles because they are more likely to carry a large shipment of contraband. You can keep any bladed weapons, just nothing that the gun dogs can smell.”</p><p>“Dammit,” Dean said, slapping his beloved Colt 1911 into Xochi’s outstretched palm.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>Sam nodded and handed over his own .45.</p><p>“Ammo too,” Xochi said.</p><p>Sam and Dean emptied their pockets into the trunk of the Impala while Claudia looked on with amazement at the growing pile of weapons.</p><p>Once they were all stripped down and harmless as civilians, Xochi closed the trunk and tossed Dean the keys.</p><p>“I hate this,” Dean said.</p><p>“Don’t be scared,” Xochi said, with a sarcastic smile. “I’ll be here to protect you.”</p><p>“Let’s get on the road, already,” Sam said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-30">CHAPTER 30</span><a href="#chapter-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Getting across the border was more boring that stressful. Traffic was backed up and creeping along. Guys with dogs and mirrors on sticks strolled up and down the lanes, peering in through windshields. People in the cars had that dull, thousand-yard stare you see in any morning rush hour anywhere in the world. There were traffic lights over each lane, either red or green. If you got a red light you had to go get a full inspection. Dean got a green light. No problem.</p><p>When they finally made it through to the other side, they passed underneath a big sign that read “Bienvenido a Mexico.” Xochi directed Dean onto the astoundingly named Periférico Luis Donaldo Colosio Murrieta, bypassing the more touristy shops and cheap pharmacies and heading down into the gritty heart of the other Nogales.</p><p>“Pull over here,” Xochi said, indicating a large, bland franchise hotel that seemed set up to cater to foreign business travelers.</p><p>Dean did as she requested, though it was easier said than done. He had to battle several mobile vendors, a pair of kids engaged in a scrappy fist-fight and a swearing woman in a pick-up truck, in order to get the Rover to the curb.</p><p>“Sam, take Claudia and check into that hotel,” Xochi said. “I don’t want her anywhere near the business Dean and I will be doing, but I also don’t want her to be alone. The truth is, you two are much more important to this hunt than we are. I can’t risk anything happening to either one of you.”</p><p>Sam frowned. “Am I gonna get arrested for trying to check into a hotel with a fifteen-year-old girl?”</p><p>Xochi shook her head ruefully.</p><p>“Not in Mexico,” she said. “In fact, you probably won’t be the only one.”</p><p>“I hate it here,” Claudia said, arms crossed and slouching in an elaborate expression of distaste. “It’s worse that TJ. It’s gross and dirty and my phone doesn’t work.” She reached out and put her hand on Dean’s arm. “Why can’t Dean stay with me?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said, pulling away from her. “You know, I can’t. See, I really gotta... go do this other thing right now. You’ll be fine with Sam.”</p><p>“We won’t be long,” Xochi said. “Go on.” Xochi handed her backpack to Claudia. “Hold on to my things for me. We’ll bring back some fresh clothes for all of us too, okay?”</p><p>Sam got out of the car and led the theatrically pouting teenager over to the hotel. Dean watched Sam push the door open and let Claudia go ahead of him. It really did look bad, this Gigantor American with no luggage leading a tiny Mexican teenager into a border-town hotel. What made it worse was that there were tons of people around, not bangers or obvious criminals, just ordinary citizens going about their daily business and no one even looked twice.</p><p>Once Sam and Claudia were safely inside the hotel, Xochi got out of the back seat and came around to the driver’s side.</p><p>“Better let me drive,” she said.</p><p>Dean was happy to let her take the wheel. Driving in this town was like a bad video game. He slid across to the passenger side and she got in behind the wheel.</p><p>“What are we doing again?” he asked.</p><p>“You want guns, don’t you?” she asked, pulling the Rover out into traffic and heading south, away from the border. She took a few, seemingly random turns, laying on the horn to clear dogs and ice-cream vendors and women with huge carts of laundry out of their way. Dean tried to keep a fix on where they were in relation to the hotel, but soon got utterly turned around in the chaos.</p><p>Eventually, Xochi turned down a narrow side street and parked. There was a tiny hair salon that didn’t look open across the street and some other sort of establishment whose business wasn’t immediately obvious to Dean. The building they wanted was a sad, crumbling little structure that seemed too square and featureless to be a private house, but too small to be any kind of commercial building. It was painted bright blue, the thick paint cracked and peeling to reveal an earlier, pink-and-white birthday-cake color scheme. The doors and windows were heavily barred, the bars painted pink to match the previous color scheme and never redone. All the streets they’d been down so far were jumping with pedestrians, but this street was nearly deserted.</p><p>Xochi pulled out her cell and dialed. Spoke a few words, nodded and pocketed the phone.</p><p>“He’s there,” she said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>She got out of the Rover and Dean did the same. Dean watched as she called a kid who looked about Ben’s age over to the car. She started doling out money, pointing to the car. The kid winked and lifted his T-shirt, revealing the handle of a gun protruding from the waistband of his jeans. Xochi thanked him and then motioned for Dean to go with her into the blue building. He followed close behind her, not happy to be going into something like this unarmed. Especially because everyone else seemed to be armed except for him. He had no choice but to trust Xochi on this.</p><p>They entered a dim, musty hallway lined with about twenty electric meters. It seemed impossible to Dean that a building so small could house so many different households. Xochi headed to the back and took a set of sagging stairs up to the second floor. Dean followed without comment.</p><p>The first door at the top of the stairs was open. Xochi went right in and motioned for Dean to join her. She shut the door after him and turned a key that had been left sticking out of the lock.</p><p>It was an empty room, empty except for a tall, wiry man in his late thirties with a stoned, beatific smile and a black duffle bag. Thinning hair slicked back into a rat-tail, a large, broken nose and a pinkie ring. He wore immaculate, sharply pressed jeans and a shiny red cowboy shirt unbuttoned at the throat to reveal way too much werewolf chest hair. His dinner-plate-sized belt-buckle had the letters “BM” spelled out in red rhinestones.</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said. “This is Baby Malo.”</p><p>Dean couldn’t imagine why anyone so hairy would be nicknamed “baby” anything but he was willing to roll with it. The guy seemed friendly enough.</p><p>He said something to Xochi in Spanish and then switched to English. “I couldn’t get HKs. Glock okay?”</p><p>“Did you get the Benelli?” Xochi asked.</p><p>He said something else in Spanish and unzipped the bag, pulling out a gorgeous, brand-new 12-gage tactical M4 in desert camo. He handed it to Dean.</p><p>“Damn that’s nice,” Dean said, checking the chamber and finding it hot and ready to rock. “I take it this isn’t loaded with salt, right?”</p><p>Xochi shook her head, taking a Glock 17 from the bag and looking it over.</p><p>“Standard rounds, yes, but I have a friend in Chihuahua who makes 12-gage slugs in solid silver. For the Nagual.”</p><p>Dean whistled.</p><p>“Yeah, that’ll do it.”</p><p>There was a sudden heavy pounding on the door. Dean spun reflexively toward the sound and Xochi did the same. Baby Malo didn’t wait to see who it was, just took off through a door on the far end of the room, leaving the bag behind. A deep, masculine voice called out from the other side of the door. It needed no translation.</p><p>“POLICIA!”</p><p>Dean swore and lowered the shotgun. Of all the potential problems he might have imagined they’d encounter on this hunt, getting arrested for buying guns in Mexico certainly wasn’t one of them.</p><p>“What do we do?” Dean asked Xochi.</p><p>“Come on,” she said, grabbing the bag of guns and taking off after Baby Malo.</p><p>The next room was furnished, two small beds, a sofa and a card table with four chairs. There was so much furniture that it was hard to maneuver in the narrow space. Xochi jumped up onto the couch, walking across the cushions and heading for a barred metal door that seemed to lead to some kind of balcony. Dean could hear the door back in the other room splintering. The cops would be in any second. He followed Xochi out onto the balcony, and found her with one leg over the railing.</p><p>“Jump,” she said, and was gone.</p><p>Dean looked over the edge and saw a weedy little yard surrounded by high brick walls. There was a weird plastic ride-on toy for kids sitting in the corner, a large yellow duck with wheels and a saddle like a horse. Xochi crouched in the middle of the yard with the Glock in one hand and the bag in the other.</p><p>“Hurry,” she hissed.</p><p>It sounded like the cops were through the door and into the empty room next door. Dean didn’t need any more incentive. He jumped.</p><p>He hit the packed dirt hard but managed to hold onto the shotgun. Xochi kicked open a door on the ground level and Dean followed her back into the building. He could hear heavy-booted footsteps upstairs and men’s voices. That’s when his phone started to vibrate in his pocket.</p><p>Xochi was trying several doors and finding them all key locked. Dean took out his phone and looked at the screen. It was Bobby Singer, calling on the line that he only used in case of dire emergency. Dean took the call.</p><p>“It’s not a good time, Bobby,” Dean said.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Xochi said, looking back over her shoulder before starting to kick at one of the locked doors. “Put that away!”</p><p>“Dean,” Bobby said, his familiar drawl dropping in and out. “What the hell’s going on down there?”</p><p>“Look,” Dean said. “I got a major law enforcement situation here...”</p><p>“Yeah,” Bobby said. “Well, I just got a call from your brother’s phone. Some Mexican guy telling me to wire twenty-five grand or they’ll kill Sam.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-31">CHAPTER 31</span><a href="#chapter-31" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi kicked the door one last time and it finally gave. On the other side was a single cop.</p><p>He looked about eighteen. Bad skin and a sorry, adolescent excuse for a moustache. He was dressed in black fatigues and a black Kevlar vest with “POLICIA” in big yellow letters. He looked like a startled cat, AK47 pointed at his dusty boots.</p><p>Xochi dove back, away from the door. Dean dropped the phone and reflexively raised the shotgun, drawing a bead between the kid’s eyes.</p><p>“Dean?” Bobby’s tiny voice echoed from the phone on the floor near Dean’s boot. “Dean, you there?”</p><p>The kid looked absolutely terrified, nearly cross-eyed staring down the barrel of the big gun. This was their chance to get away, but Dean couldn’t help remembering what he’d said to Sam about ganking innocent humans. He just couldn’t pull the trigger.</p><p>Six other officers came barreling down the stairs, pouring in behind the kid and screaming at Dean in Spanish. An older guy with a real, grown-up moustache stepped into the room, ripping the shottie out of Dean’s grip and throwing him against the wall.</p><p>Xochi let out what was probably a colorful string of Spanish profanity and dropped the Glock before another officer did the same to her, kicking her legs apart and patting her down with obvious enthusiasm. The nervous kid picked up Dean’s phone, ending Bobby’s call and slipping the phone into a zippered plastic bag. The guy with the thick moustache cuffed Dean and led him out of the building.</p><p>Out on the sidewalk, three more officers had wrestled Baby Malo to the ground. One of them had a knee pressed into the small of his back and was cuffing him, while another pressed a handgun to his head.</p><p>Dean was unceremoniously stuffed into the back of a dirty-white police cruiser. Officer Moustache didn’t bother to cup the back of Dean’s head to stop him from banging it into the door frame. As tense as he was about his own situation, Dean couldn’t think about anything except Sam. Sam, and Claudia. Where was Claudia during all this? Did the people who had Sam also have Claudia? It had clearly been a serious mistake to bring her with them. Maybe a fatal mistake.</p><p>The cops put Baby Malo in the back of the cruiser with Dean.</p><p>“No, no, wait a second,” Dean began.</p><p>They didn’t wait a second. They just slammed the car door and rapped on the roof to tell the driver to take off. As the cruiser pulled out into traffic, Dean twisted back to see Xochi being led out of the building between two big bruisers.</p><p>“Where are they taking Xochi?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Jail,” Baby Malo said. “Just like us. Only it’ll probably take her, like, twice as long to get there.”</p><p>“What?” Dean tried to look back again, but they’d already turned a corner. “What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“I mean those guys will want to spend some time with her before they bring her in. That’s how it is with women prisoners.”</p><p>If Dean’s hands weren’t cuffed behind his back, he would have put his head in them. How had this happened?</p><p>Dean and Baby Malo stood together in a crowded holding cell inside the Nogales police station. There were probably twenty-five men in the ten-by-ten cage made of flimsy chain-link fencing. Several rattling electric fans did their best to circulate the stale air, but it was still unbearably hot and stank of stale sweat and urine. Outside the cage were three hostile, perspiring guards with automatic rifles—in case anyone got the idea that it might not be that hard to pull the chain-link loose from the connecting poles.</p><p>There was a single long metal bench along the left side of the cell, but it seemed to be “reserved” for the small group of tattooed bangers who guarded it like dogs and wouldn’t let anyone else anywhere near it. As soon as they had entered, Dean noticed a strange kind of hierarchy in the cramped space. Those higher up on the food chain were allowed to stand closer to the door, where you could almost catch a whiff of fresh air coming from the distant windows. Those at the other end of the spectrum were forced to hang out beside the long cement trough in the floor that stood in for a urinal, slanting down to a stinking hole in the far corner of the floor. Baby Malo was somewhere in the middle and Dean, by association, was allowed to stand beside him. Dean didn’t even want to think about what would have happened to him if he had been alone.</p><p>Dean wished there was room enough to pace. He was feeling anxious, frustrated and impotent. Even though he knew it would be a terrible idea, he was itching for someone to pick a fight with him, just to give him something to do with his hands, and somewhere else to take his head. There was no worse feeling in the world than knowing your friends and family were in danger and not being able to do a damn thing about it. He’d just have to count on Bobby to stay on it until Dean could find a way to get himself out of this mess.</p><p>“You know,” Dean said to Baby Malo, just to say something, “I could have happily lived the rest of my life without ever experiencing this particular odor.”</p><p>“This here is the high-roller suite,” Baby Malo said. “Wait till they process you and move you into the real cells.”</p><p>“This is seriously screwed, is what it is,” Dean said.</p><p>“You’re telling me?” Baby Malo said. “This is my third time for weapons.”</p><p>“It’s not just that,” Dean said. “I think somebody kidnapped my brother.”</p><p>“That’s messed up,” Baby Malo said, heavy eyebrows drawn together in a frown. “Your people better pay.”</p><p>“That’s why I’ve got to get the hell out of here,” Dean said.</p><p>“What’s your brother look like?” Baby Malo asked.</p><p>“Big.” Dean indicated Sam’s approximate height in the air, several inches above his own. “Six-four, 190. Brown hair, kinda longish. He was with a young Mexican-American girl with a bright-red streak in her hair.”</p><p>“Six-four?” Baby Malo’s frown deepened. “Doesn’t exactly sound like an easy snatch.”</p><p>“Look, I don’t know anything here,” Dean said, frustration closing his throat and making his voice tight. “All I know is what I heard.”</p><p>“Okay, listen,” Baby Malo said. “Lemme ask around a little. See if anyone has maybe heard something about it.”</p><p>Baby Malo moved through the crowd, talking low out of the corner of his mouth. Dean stood alone, clenching and unclenching his fists. Sam and Xochi were both perfectly capable of taking care of themselves, but he couldn’t stop obsessing over where they were or what was happening to them. And what about Claudia? It made him absolutely crazy to be locked up like this.</p><p>Baby Malo worked his way back to Dean, shaking his head.</p><p>“Nobody knows nothing,” Baby Malo said. “No word of any big Norteamericano getting snatched by any of the usual gangs.”</p><p>A gruff male voice called out Dean’s name.</p><p>“Winchester?”</p><p>Two handsome, stone-faced Mexican guys who could have been twins were waiting on the other side of the door to the cage. Their get-up was remarkable similar to the uniforms of the police and armed guards. Black, military-style combat fatigues, bulletproof vests and black ball caps. The only obvious difference was that the now familiar word POLICIA on their caps was followed by the word “FEDERAL.”</p><p>“Federales?” Baby Malo whispered. “You in deep now, guero.”</p><p>“Take care of yourself,” Dean said. “And thanks.”</p><p>“You the one who better take care,” Baby Malo replied.</p><p>Dean came forward as the guard unlocked the door. There were some comments from the bangers on the bench, but Dean had no idea what any of it meant. The federales cuffed Dean again and led him through the sweltering station, out into the street. He was sizing up his captors and the street around them, seriously considering just making a crazy break for it when he spotted Xochi in the back of a big black SUV. Her head was down, hands obviously cuffed behind her back. He was glad to see her, relieved she was okay, but seeing her made him worry even more about Sam and Claudia.</p><p>The twins stuck Dean in the back seat with Xochi and then got into the front. The front and back of the SUV were separated by a heavy wire-gauge screen. There were no handles on the inside of the two back doors.</p><p>Dean was appalled to see Xochi sporting a shiny new black eye. Her shirt was torn and soaked with blood.</p><p>“Damn,” Dean said. “What did they do to you?”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” she said. “Most of this isn’t my blood. Those cops picked the wrong little girl to play with.”</p><p>Her voice sounded a little slushy, like she had a mouthful of marbles. He was kind of surprised when she leaned into him like she was about to kiss him on the cheek. But she didn’t kiss him, she whispered in his ear.</p><p>“These men are not federales,” she said, so softly he could barely hear her over the grumbling of the engine. “They are Nagual.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-32">CHAPTER 32</span><a href="#chapter-32" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean was too stunned to speak. They’d barely been in Mexico for six hours and things were already going to hell at the speed of light. The traffic along the main drag was horrible, snarled up and inching along so slowly that they were being regularly passed by pedestrians. There was some sort of massive accident up ahead and tempers were flaring hot, people hanging out of their cars and shaking their fists. The stench of exhaust made Dean’s eyes burn, even with all the windows rolled up.</p><p>“Where are they taking us?” Dean whispered.</p><p>“They are probably planning to take us out into the desert and kill us,” she said. “But don’t worry.”</p><p>She did something so peculiar then, that for a minute Dean had no idea how to respond. She bent down and pressed her lips to the palm of one of his cuffed hands. He felt the heat of her breath and a brief flicker of her tongue against his skin that sent chills down his sweaty back. He really didn’t need to add vaguely, pointlessly, horny to the stew of anger and fear and worry already churning in his aching belly. It took him several baffled seconds to realize what she had actually done: She’d spat something into his hand. Something small and metal. A key. A handcuff key.</p><p>“Will you marry me?” he whispered, twisting his fingers and working the key into the lock on his cuffs.</p><p>She smiled. “Get your cuffs off,” she said. “Then hand me the key and follow my lead, okay?”</p><p>He did as she requested, keeping an eye on the twins in the front. They both remained silent, facing forward. When she had freed herself from her own cuffs, she leaned into him again.</p><p>“Are you ready?” she asked.</p><p>“As I’ll ever be,” he replied.</p><p>She sat completely still, eyes wide and watching a battered minivan pull up on the driver’s side of their SUV. The minivan inched ahead of them, just enough so that its dented flank blocked the driver’s side door from opening but not the rear door. Dean already knew how fast Xochi was, but it still amazed him to watch her in action. She kicked out the back window, reached through the hole to open the door from the outside and took off down the busy street in the time it took Dean to suck in a single breath.</p><p>The guy driving hit the breaks, swearing and trying to open his door. It opened a little less than six inches and then banged into the minivan. The guy on Dean’s side was already out and drawing down on Xochi’s running back with some kind of preposterous Dirty Harry hand cannon.</p><p>“Get down!” Dean yelled, diving out of the SUV and taking off after Xochi. He heard shots and the screams of bystanders as everyone in the street ran for cover.</p><p>Dean risked a look back and saw that the driver had climbed across the seat and out the passenger side. He had a snub-nosed pistol in his fist. It looked like a toy next to the cannon wielded by his clearly overcompensating buddy.</p><p>Up ahead, Xochi was zigzagging like a rabbit through the frozen traffic, staying low and never providing a clear target.</p><p>Dean could see bullets striking sparks off an abandoned cab a few feet ahead of him and before he could register how dangerous that was, the cab went up in a toxic cloud of choking black smoke and shimmering flame.</p><p>Dean threw himself down on his belly between two cars just as the cab blew with a strangely flat, eardrum-crushing sound like giant clapping wool-gloved hands. Dean felt like that same giant had just boxed his ears.</p><p>When he dared to look up again, Dean saw mad chaos all around. Women grasping crying children, running through the street. Men leaning out of windows to see what was going on. A dozen small retail stands had been knocked over. People selling corn-on-the-cob, bootlegged DVDs and magazines, toys and cheap silver jewelry all had their wares scattered into the street. Dean could see Xochi peeking up between a beater hatchback and a more fortunate taxicab and ran toward her.</p><p>When he reached her, she gripped his hand and pulled him toward the debris of the street vendors.</p><p>“They won’t change their form in front of all these people,” Xochi said. “So we have a chance to outrun them. But I have a better idea.”</p><p>She ran through the broken mess of plastic toys, looking back over her shoulder toward the twins, almost daring them to follow her. Of course, they did. As she ran, she scooped up a black-velvet tray of cheesy silver rings and pendants.</p><p>“Put these on,” Xochi said as they ran, handing Dean a handful of rings. “Both hands.”</p><p>He got what she was planning almost right away, so he did as she’d said, cramming as many goofy pot-leaf and skull rings as he could fit onto all his fingers. Moments later, she ducked into a little bakery and Dean followed close behind.</p><p>Inside the bakery, two older women were decorating a wedding cake. One was fat and sweet-faced, wider than she was tall with white hair coiffed into a fancy updo and wearing a floral apron. The other was pale and thin with a large, narrow nose, dyed red hair cut mannishly short and pink T-shirt that said “SEXY” in glittery silver letters. When they saw Dean and Xochi, they froze, pastry bags full of pearly white frosting held up like weapons.</p><p>Xochi asked them something in Spanish, and the fat one responded, indicating a door in the rear of the store. Xochi ran for the door, which opened into a narrow back alley full of trash and illegible graffiti.</p><p>“When the first guy comes through the door,” Xochi said, flattening herself out against the wall. “Let him have it.”</p><p>“Right,” Dean said, pressing his back to the opposite side of the door and trying to keep his breathing under control.</p><p>He was still scared, but it was the good kind of scared. The action, adrenalin-fueled kind of scared, rather than the trapped, helpless kind of scared he’d been feeling since the arrest. This was what he was good at, kicking monster ass. He had this.</p><p>The first Nagual came barreling through the bakery door and Dean spun toward him, firing off a straight right and aiming for exposed skin, for the guy’s unshaven chin. He connected, a spike of hot pain jolted his wrist, but the guy went down like he’d been shot, skin burning and blistering from the impact of the silver rings. Dean dropped to one knee beside him and followed through with a few more for good measure.</p><p>When the second shifter came through the door, Xochi garroted him from behind with a thick silver chain. The silver smoked and burned like it was molten hot, sinking deep into the flesh of the Nagual’s throat. He fell to his knees, then collapsed on one side in the slimy gutter. Xochi let him go and relieved him of the enormous gun, which turned out to be a Smith &amp; Wesson model 500 .50 caliber Magnum. Dean took the snub-nosed .38 from the shifter he’d KO’d and swiftly patted him down for other weapons. He found a full-sized .45, a nasty-looking telescoping baton, a Leatherman multipurpose tool that would definitely come in handy, and a flint knife kind of like Xochi’s, only this one had a hideous, skull-faced woman carved into the handle.</p><p>“Leave the Nagual knife,” Xochi said. She had found a similar one on her shifter and let it drop to the pavement like it was rotten. “It is unclean. An instrument of evil.”</p><p>Dean looked the flint knife over. Shrugged. Let it drop.</p><p>The two ladies from the bakery stuck their heads out the back door, expressions curious. Xochi said something that sounded apologetic. The sweet-faced one in the floral apron leaned over and spat on the prone body of the shifter who’d been garroted.</p><p>“Pinchés federales!” she said.</p><p>Dean had to stifle a laugh.</p><p>“Wow,” he said. “How does she really feel?”</p><p>“People here have no love for the federales,” Xochi told Dean. “Many are corrupt, tied in with the drug gangs.” She leaned in closer to drop her voice and whisper. “It’s better if grandmas like these two don’t know what these men really are. Safer for them.”</p><p>Dean got it. He nodded.</p><p>“Let’s get the hell out of here,” he said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-33">CHAPTER 33</span><a href="#chapter-33" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>As they made their way on foot back to the hotel, Dean filled Xochi in on what was going on with Sam. She was furious; she looked ready to slug someone. Anyone.</p><p>“Dean,” she said, hand on his arm and looking up at him with emotion leaking around the edges of her intense gaze. “We’ll find Sam. I swear to you, on my mother’s soul. I won’t let anything happen to him.”</p><p>Dean nodded and looked away, thinking of what had happened to Xochi’s own little brother. Hoping she was right.</p><p>“This is my fault,” she said, pressing a clenched fist to her temple. “So stupid of me. We should have stayed together.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. “But what would have happened to Claudia if she’d been arrested with us? Maybe you can fight off those scumbags with your bare hands, but I doubt she could. Maybe it was wrong to bring her at all.”</p><p>“Well,” Xochi said. “Better she be with us than following her mother on her own. Besides, I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to scare her, but the Nagual will be tracking her by now. They know she is our link to the Borderwalker and they will want to take her out.”</p><p>Dean felt like bad luck was shadowing him everywhere he turned and sloshing over onto everyone around him. It seemed like anybody he’d ever set out to protect always ended up worse off than they would have been if they’d never met him.</p><p>Xochi stopped on the way to buy a pair of prepaid cell phones from a small electronics shop and gave one to Dean.</p><p>“Call your friend Bobby,” she said. “I will make some calls and see what I can dig up about who might have taken Sam.”</p><p>Dean turned on the phone and dialed Bobby.</p><p>“You touch a hair on that boy’s head, so help me...” Bobby said.</p><p>“Bobby,” Dean said. “Take it easy, it’s me.”</p><p>“Dean,” Bobby said. “Jeez, what the hell happened to you?”</p><p>“Got arrested,” Dean said. “But I released myself on my own recognizance. Xochi’s with me.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Yeah, well never mind that now,” Dean said. “What have you heard from the people who have Sammy?”</p><p>“Nothing since that first call.”</p><p>“Did you wire the money?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not yet,” Bobby said. “Not that I’ve got that kind of money laying around, but they’ve given me till midnight and I didn’t want to do anything until I heard back from you. I tried calling the American Consulate to see if there was any way to spring you, but they’ve been giving me the runaround.”</p><p>“Okay, just hang tight, man,” Dean said. “Xochi’s making inquiries.”</p><p>“So who is this Xochi person anyway?”</p><p>“Long story,” Dean replied.</p><p>“A female kinda story?”</p><p>“What the hell does that have to do with anything?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Oh, nothing,” Bobby said. “It’s just nice to hear that you’re getting back into the action.”</p><p>“Bobby,” Dean said. “I’m hanging up now. I have to find my brother.”</p><p>He ended the call.</p><p>Xochi was talking a mile a minute into her phone as they rounded the corner and came upon the hotel where Sam and Claudia were supposed to be holed up. She ended her call and cranked up her pace, nearly running to the double glass doors.</p><p>“I’m not finding anything yet,” she said. “But I’m not giving up. Let’s go in and see if maybe Claudia is still here.”</p><p>The lobby of the hotel was a strange sort of mash-up of bland, corporate franchise and bizarre, over-the-top local color. There were a few stray, striped polyester couches that looked like they’d been stolen from a Best Western in Scranton back in 1981. When Dean looked closer, he noticed that they were the same approximate color scheme, but didn’t exactly match. The carpet was hot pink, which also didn’t exactly match. Framed swap-meet paintings cluttered the walls, a strange, incompatible mix of gory bullfighting scenes, cute little boys in oversized sombreros and images of the Virgin Mary. Hovering over the blond fake-wood check-in desk was an enormous, asymmetrical brass and glass chandelier that could have doubled as some kind of medieval torture device. The mousy young girl at the desk looked like she lived in constant fear of being decapitated by that light fixture at any moment.</p><p>“Hey there,” Dean said. “I’m looking for my brother. He’s a big guy, about...”</p><p>“Mister Swierczynski?” she asked. “Just checked in this morning with his niece,” she looked down at her book. “Jennifer. With that...”</p><p>She pointed to her lower lip.</p><p>“That’s them,” Dean said.</p><p>“She your daughter, huh?”</p><p>Xochi stepped up and took Dean’s hand.</p><p>“Our daughter,” she said. “Yes.”</p><p>“Room 418,” she said.</p><p>“Did you see either one of them leave since they checked in?” Dean asked.</p><p>She shook her head.</p><p>“No,” she said. “They didn’t come out this way, but there’s another door in the back.”</p><p>“Okay, thanks,” Dean said.</p><p>“My pleasure,” she said. Then she leaned in and said something to Xochi in Spanish.</p><p>“What she’d say?” Dean asked as they walked over to the elevator.</p><p>“She said she wouldn’t let her daughter wear a lip ring.”</p><p>Dean shook his head.</p><p>“Why did you say Claudia was our daughter?” Dean said. “Nobody’s gonna believe that. What, did we have her when we were in high school?”</p><p>“I didn’t go to high school,” Xochi said. “And of course people will believe it. Why wouldn’t they? My own mother was only a year older than Claudia when she had Teo.”</p><p>The elevator came. They got on in silence and rode to the fourth floor. In spite of everything else that was on his mind in that moment, Dean was struck again by the complexity of this strange yoyo connection he felt with Xochi. They had developed an intense foxhole camaraderie almost immediately, and there were times when he felt so close to her, like they had so much in common. Then there were other times, like now, when he really felt the gulf of vast cultural differences that lay between them.</p><p>“You have any kids?” Dean asked as the elevator slowly counted off the floors. He didn’t know why it had never occurred to him to ask before.</p><p>“Someday maybe,” she said. “There is pressure from my family, of course, but I’m not ready. Not yet. Not after what happened to my brother. What about you?”</p><p>Dean thought of Ben. Shook his head.</p><p>“No,” he said.</p><p>The elevator opened on the fourth floor. Xochi got out. She didn’t say anything else. Dean didn’t know what to say either, so he just kept quiet.</p><p>Room 418 was inexplicably right next to the elevator. Dean knocked.</p><p>“Claudia?” he said. “It’s Dean, you in there?”</p><p>The door opened. Sam was standing there with a bottle of water in one hand.</p><h2><span id="chapter-34">CHAPTER 34</span><a href="#chapter-34" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What the hell happened to you guys?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean let out a yelp of relieved laughter and pulled his brother into a bear hug, not even caring that Sam just let himself be hugged like a patient dog getting loved-up by an over-enthusiastic toddler.</p><p>“What happened to us?” Dean asked incredulous. “What the hell happened to you? I thought you’d been kidnapped!”</p><p>“Kidnapped?” Sam frowned. “Why would you think that?”</p><p>Dean told him about the call from Bobby. Sam patted his pockets, unable to find his cell phone.</p><p>“Kid bumped into me by the soda machine,” Sam said. “Must have clipped my phone. Man, that’s a pretty good scam.”</p><p>Dean handed Sam the prepaid phone and told him to call Bobby. Xochi headed into the bathroom to change out of her bloody shirt and into a spare tank top. Claudia was sitting on the bed with the TV remote in her hand, scowling at the bolted-down television. Dean could see that she’d been crying again. He felt kind of bad for leaving her alone with Mr. Sensitive. Dean was the first one to admit that he was a lousy grief counselor, but he was Dr. Phil compared to Sam in his current condition.</p><p>He walked over to her.</p><p>“You okay?” he asked.</p><p>She looked up at him, fresh tears spilling down her chubby cheeks. She stood and threw her arms around him, nearly knocking him back a step.</p><p>“Hey, take it easy now,” he said, shifting uncomfortably and looking over at Xochi. “Come on, kid, it’s gonna be okay.”</p><p>That sounded so lame. He wouldn’t even have believed that kind of tripe back when he was Claudia’s age.</p><p>“Listen,” he finally said, extracting himself from her damp clutches and sitting her back down on the bed. “Xochi, Sam and me, we’re not social workers. We’re hunters. I know you’re hurting right now, but there’s nothing any of us can do about that. What we can do is work this hunt, the four of us together. We can beat the evil bitch who’s responsible for what happened to your mom, but in order to do that, we need your help. We need you on the team.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Xochi said. “We need you to be strong now. To be a grown woman. Can you do that?”</p><p>Claudia hung her head, looking down at her hands in her lap.</p><p>Xochi came over and sat beside Claudia, motioning with her chin for Dean to beat it. He was happy to oblige.</p><p>“I’m fine, Bobby,” Sam was saying into the phone. “Really, it was just some kind of scam. The guy probably called every single number on that phone, just to see if anyone would fall for it.”</p><p>Xochi was talking low to Claudia in Spanish. Whatever she was saying seemed to be working. Claudia finally raised her head, swiping at her tears. When she turned to Xochi and saw the shiner, her smudgy raccoon eyes went wide.</p><p>“Whoa,” Claudia said. “What happened to you?”</p><p>“Cops,” Xochi said. “We’d better get out of Nogales.”</p><p>“Cops? Wow.”</p><p>Claudia was obviously tremendously impressed by the idea of Xochi being some sort of outlaw. She turned back to Dean.</p><p>“Are you okay, Dean?” she asked. “Did you get beat up too?”</p><p>“Nah,” Dean said. “Guess I wasn’t their type.”</p><p>“Right, okay,” Sam said to Bobby. “We’ll stay in touch, but in the meanwhile, see what you can dig up on an Aztec goddess called the Clawed Butterfly. How do you spell that name again, Xochi?”</p><p>“I-t-z-p-a-p-a-l-o-t-l,” Xochi replied.</p><p>Sam repeated the spelling into the phone. Nodded, listening.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s her,” he said, smirking at Dean. “Smokin’ hot, actually.” Pause. A laugh. “Tell me about it.” Another pause. “Right, later.”</p><p>“So what do we do now?” Dean asked, ignoring Sam. “We need to get some new wheels, right?”</p><p>“There’s a good chance that the Rover and the bikes may still be where we left them,” Xochi said. “We should at least check it out.”</p><p>“Then what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“If we can score another shotgun,” Dean said, “I’d love to pay a visit to your buddy who makes those silver slugs.”</p><p>“Okay,” Xochi said. “So we head for Chihuahua. We can stop along the way to see if Huehuecoyotl will speak to us. It will be best at night, somewhere far from any cities. Claudia, any idea of where Elvia is now?”</p><p>“I’m not sure,” Claudia said. “I think she doesn’t really know where she is either. Only that she is moving south.”</p><p>“Well, then we better get moving too,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam gathered up his laptop and files and shouldered the bag, while Claudia went into the bathroom to fix her eyeliner.</p><p>“What did you say to her to make her turn off the waterworks?” Dean asked Xochi after Claudia closed the bathroom door.</p><p>“I told her that you like tough girls,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Aw man,” Dean said. “Don’t encourage her. You’re just making it worse.”</p><p>“It worked, didn’t it?”</p><p>“It’s not even true,” Dean said.</p><p>“No?” She arched a knowing brow at him, then shrugged. “My mistake.”</p><p>By some crazy miracle, the Rover was right where they had left it, both dirt bikes unmolested in their trailer. The only thing missing was one of the two helmets. And the keys, of course. Confiscated by the cops when Xochi was arrested.</p><p>The kid with the gun seemed to be apologizing profusely for the missing helmet. Xochi gave him more money anyway. He gave them two thumbs-up and scampered off down the street. Dean didn’t want to think about what he would be spending that money on.</p><p>“What did he say?” Sam asked.</p><p>“He said another kid ran off with the helmet,” Xochi said, bending down to pick the driver’s side lock. “And that he would go find that kid and get it back, but I told him we didn’t have time to wait. I told him if he did get it back, he could keep it.”</p><p>She popped the lock and opened the car door, getting in behind the wheel. Dean jumped in the shotgun seat and Sam and Claudia got in the back. Dean watched Xochi swiftly and efficiently hot wire the Rover and start it up.</p><p>“Okay,” she said. “Adios, Nogales.”</p><p>They hit the road.</p><h2><span id="chapter-35">CHAPTER 35</span><a href="#chapter-35" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean had no idea where they were or what made Xochi pick this particular spot to pull over. The desert they rode through was virtually identical to what they’d encountered in Arizona, but it still felt infinitely strange and foreign. Wilder, more dangerous. By they time they’d arrived at what Xochi deemed to be an appropriate location, it was full dark.</p><p>“After what happened in Nogales,” Xochi said as she killed the engine. “We stay together no matter what, okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “But we’ve only got the two bikes.”</p><p>“No problem,” Dean said. “Claudia can ride with you and Xochi with me.”</p><p>“Why can’t I ride with you?” Claudia asked. “Let Xochi ride with Sam.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Dean,” Xochi said, ignoring Claudia. “I’m afraid it will be you who will be riding behind me. Someone needs to lead the way, following the ley lines.”</p><p>“You could just tell me which way to go,” Dean suggested, knowing full well that that wasn’t going to happen.</p><p>They got out of the Rover and Sam unlatched the trailer, dropping the ramp and rolling one of the bikes down. Xochi jumped up onto the trailer and tossed the only remaining helmet to Claudia before bringing the other bike down onto the road.</p><p>Claudia pouted and put on the helmet, climbing reluctantly onto the dirt bike behind Sam and locking her arms around his waist. Xochi mounted up on the other and looked back over her shoulder at Dean.</p><p>“Hop on, tough guy.”</p><p>When Dean got onto the bitch seat behind Xochi, he knew right away what he was in for. He hadn’t had a decent, uninterrupted stretch of privacy since he’d started working this hunt, and he knew damn well that if he spent more than a few seconds pressed up against that ass he was going to be loaded for bear. When she cranked the engine and took off into the desert, Dean grabbed the edge of the seat behind him with white knuckles, struggling to maintain a cushion of respectable space between his crotch and Xochi’s ass. But the rugged Sonoran terrain was so challenging that within the first five minutes, Dean had no choice but to hold on to her tiny waist or risk falling off the back like a drunken biker chick.</p><p>They were passing through a desolate, moonlit landscape that could have easily passed for the surface of an alien planet. Cryptic rock formations towered over them and arroyos branched across the bone-dry ground like veins and arteries. Tumbleweeds bounded and spun through their slipstream.</p><p>Dean wasn’t paying attention to any of that. He was too busy trying to think about fat, smelly old bag ladies. Or trying to think about wiping out on the dirt bike and smashing his bare head to bits on the jagged rocks. Or trying to think about pretty much anything other than the way that Xochi’s tight, leather-clad ass was bumping and sliding against him. Trying and failing. She kept on raising and lowering her hips over and over, deftly compensating for the dips and shifting her weight with the twists and curves. It didn’t help that he had to move and shift his own weight with hers, following her lead and leaning with her into the turns to keep the little dirt bike stable beneath them.</p><p>When they came into a narrow box canyon and Xochi braked, then eased the bike to a stop, Dean didn’t know whether to be relieved or disappointed.</p><p>Sam pulled up beside them, Claudia hopping off and removing the helmet before he’d killed the engine. Dean got down from behind Xochi, using the bulk of the bike to hide what was going on below his belt from Sam and Claudia.</p><p>Xochi put down the kickstand and dismounted, pulling a small Maglite from one of her pockets.</p><p>“Come on,” Xochi said, clicking the flashlight on and focusing it on an indentation in the sand about twelve feet away from the bikes. “This way. See that little clearing?”</p><p>Sam turned on his own light and headed for the indicated clearing. Claudia silently followed him. Dean hung back.</p><p>Xochi looked over her shoulder at Dean.</p><p>“You coming?”</p><p>“Sure,” he said. “Let me just punch myself in the face a few times first.”</p><p>Again, that little half-smile, the arched brow. She turned and headed off after Sam. Watching her walk away really wasn’t helping.</p><p>Dean had no idea how the hell he’d managed to get himself so wound up like this, but he figured he’d let it go just about far enough. The world was full of women with nice asses, and he’d always been able to take them or leave them. Besides, there were plenty of bigger, more important things to worry about right now. Dead serious, end-of-civilization-as-we-know-it kind of things. He needed to start thinking with his big head for a minute and try to put things in perspective. This was nothing serious, just a basic mechanical issue. He’d take care of that as soon as he had a chance, but in the meanwhile he needed to channel Toshiro Mifune or some other equally stone-cold bad ass. Man the hell up and stop acting like a horny teenager.</p><p>He followed Xochi into the little clearing.</p><p>Claudia was gathering kindling, while Sam ran the EMF meter and Xochi laid out a bunch of herbs and ritual tools on a striped blanket.</p><p>“Weird,” Sam said. “I’m getting a pretty strong reading, but it fluctuates. Kind of like a tide coming in and out.”</p><p>He looked up at Dean.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“Peachy,” Dean snapped.</p><p>Claudia looked up at Dean with a worried expression and Dean immediately felt like a jerk.</p><p>“It’s just been a long day,” Dean said, softening his tone. “For all of us.”</p><p>“It’s not over yet,” Xochi said. “What we are doing right now is very dangerous. Not physically dangerous, but emotionally dangerous. Do you understand? Huehuecoyotl is a trickster. He will lie to you, play with you. He will turn any negative emotion against you and turn us against each other just to entertain himself. We have no secrets that he cannot know. If he tries to exploit your most private thoughts and feelings, you can’t let it hurt you.”</p><p>She turned to Sam, taking one of his hands in both of hers.</p><p>“I am trusting you, Sam,” Xochi said. “You must be our anchor, holding us steady in the stormy water of our emotions. Huehuecoyotl will not be able to play with you the way he will play with us. Especially Claudia, because she is most vulnerable.”</p><p>“Man, this is bad,” Dean said. The last thing he wanted was to share his innermost thoughts with anyone. Especially not right now. “Are you sure she should even be here?”</p><p>“We have no choice,” Xochi said. “I need both you and Sam here with me and she cannot be left alone. We must protect her at all times.”</p><p>“I’m not a baby,” Claudia said, placing the sticks she’d gathered in a small pile at the center of the clearing. “You should give me a gun.”</p><p>“Ever handled a firearm before?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Well, no,” she said. “But you could teach me.”</p><p>“We can talk about that later,” Xochi said, stacking the sticks for a fire. “For now I need you all to try and clear your minds. Focus.”</p><p>She lit the kindling with a Zippo and then lit a tight bundle of sage leaves, blowing on the end until it gave off a thick, pungent smoke. She waved her hand to direct the smoke and motioned for Claudia to come forward first. Xochi bathed each one of them in smoke, moving the burning bundle over their bodies. Dean scrunched up his nose, trying not to cough. Trying to clear his mind and not having very much luck.</p><p>He felt like a side of cured bacon by the time she was done. He was pretty sure he was never gonna get this hippy stink out of his clothes and hair. Xochi tossed the rest of the sage into the fire and then started crushing a bunch of other herbs and plants in a wooden cup. She added water and then passed the cup around. Sam took a sip and passed it to Dean. Dean frowned into the cup, less than thrilled about the muddy, acrid liquid inside.</p><p>“Come on,” Sam said. “Drink up, fannybaws.”</p><p>“What did you just call me?” Dean asked with a baffled frown.</p><p>“Hey,” Sam said. “Unlike you, I didn’t have my head in an airsick bag for the whole flight to Scotland. That cute little blonde stewardess from Dundee taught me all kinds of linguistic curiosities.”</p><p>“I’ll bet,” Dean said.</p><p>“Please,” Xochi said, flashing a warning scowl. “A little respect.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Sam said, swiftly rearranging his features into a more serious expression.</p><p>Dean bit the bullet and took a slug of the strange herbal liquid, trying not to wince at the nasty, bitter taste.</p><p>“Sorry,” he said, picking a twiggy fragment off his lower lip and passing the cup on to Claudia.</p><p>Claudia drank deep without flinching and handed the cup back to Xochi, who drained it. Then she took out her snake-handled stone knife.</p><p>“Now, we cut ourselves,” she touched the tattooed heart on her chest. “Here, over the heart. We must each make a blood sacrifice to Huehuecoyotl.”</p><p>“Awesome,” Claudia said holding out her hand for the knife. “I’ll go first.”</p><p>“I will go first,” Xochi said firmly. “Watch me and do exactly what I do. No joking, okay?”</p><p>Claudia nodded, watching eagerly as Xochi held the blade to her own chest.</p><p>“First, touch the left side of your chest with your fingertips,” Xochi said. “Moving them until you feel a strong heartbeat. When you find the strongest spot, make a small cut, moving the knife upwards, like this.” She flicked her wrist, making an inch long perfectly vertical cut in the center of her tattooed heart.</p><p>“Then, you catch the blood on the blade, like this.” She ran the edge of the knife up the length of the cut, letting the blood flow over the pale stone. “And let the blood run into the flames. Okay?”</p><p>Xochi held the knife out over the fire, then passed it to Claudia.</p><p>Xochi was in her usual tank top. Claudia had on a deep V-neck shirt and Sam a button-down. None of them had any problem exposing the necessary anatomy without removing any clothing. As Dean watched first Claudia and then his brother perform the ceremonial cuts, he really wished he was wearing anything other than a high necked T-shirt. There was just no way around the fact that if he was going to do what Xochi wanted, he would have to remove his shirt. Which wouldn’t be any kind of big deal at all if he didn’t have a crushed-out teenybopper staring at him like he was the second coming of Elvis.</p><p>Sam handed him the knife. He shrugged and pulled his shirt over his head, figuring it would be best to just get this over with. He focused on the flames in front of him as he ran his fingers over his left pec, just below the pentagram tattoo. He could feel Claudia’s eyes on him but he ignored her, concentrating on tracing the pulse of his heart beneath his skin. He made the cut.</p><p>He gathered his blood on the blade and let it run into the fire, then handed the knife back to Xochi. He couldn’t help but notice that Claudia wasn’t the only one watching him as he put his shirt back on.</p><p>Xochi spoke some strange, melodic words and then fell silent.</p><p>“Now what?” Sam asked.</p><p>She took out a handful of copal and tossed it into the fire.</p><p>“Now we wait,” she said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Nothing happened for a good twenty minutes. Dean just stood there, feeling hostile, exhausted and really not in the mood for any of this. He wondered how many cumulative hours of his life he’d spent hanging around waiting for something spooky to show up. He could hear coyotes in the distance, moving closer.</p><p>When Huehuecoyotl finally appeared, Dean was unnerved and more than a little angry to see the trickster god wearing his face.</p><p>It was Dean’s image, but it wasn’t like looking in a mirror. More like looking at a heavily retouched photo. This version of Dean didn’t have the two-day stubble or the sleepless dark circles and budding crow’s feet around his eyes. It didn’t have the annoying zit Dean could feel coming in just above his right eyebrow, or the scatter of freckles he’d always hoped he’d grow out of but never did. This version was also wearing skin-tight black-velvet lace-up pants that Dean wouldn’t be caught dead in. When that other him smiled at Claudia, Dean saw a teasing hint of vampire fangs and felt a sick helpless anger in the pit of his belly.</p><p>“Huehueteque,” Xochi said. “You honor these humble hunters with your presence.”</p><p>“The honor is mine, Xuihxochitl,” he replied stepping up to Claudia and touching the cut on her chest. “Tell me, who is this little seer?”</p><p>“My name is Claudia,” she said determinedly. “I’m not afraid.”</p><p>“No?” He turned to look at Xochi. “Such strong magic in this one.” He took Claudia’s chin in his hands, leaning close enough to kiss. “But you’ve always known you’re special, haven’t you? That’s why the others don’t understand you. They are jealous of your power.”</p><p>“Take your hands off her,” Dean said, stepping forward.</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said. “Stay calm.”</p><p>“She’s just a kid,” Dean said.</p><p>“And who are these white men?” Huehuecoyotl asked, never breaking eye contact with Claudia.</p><p>“With respect,” Xochi said. “They are my friends.” She took a step closer, trying to take his attention away from Claudia. “We want your advice, to help your lost granddaughter. To cure her affliction and make her human again so that the Tzitzimimeh cannot use her to enter our world.”</p><p>“That was your idea, wasn’t it?” Huehuecoyotl asked Claudia.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said, even though it had been Sam who had originally suggested it.</p><p>“Smart as well as beautiful,” he replied, caressing her flushed cheek.</p><p>“Look,” Dean said. “I’m not just gonna stand here and let an underage girl get hit on by a thousand-year-old pervert dressed up as me.”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl turned to Dean, green eyes flashing like a cat’s in the dark. He backed away from Claudia.</p><p>“Righteous Dean Winchester,” he said. “Brave protector of innocents. An angry boy wearing his dead father’s shoes. Tell me, Dean, how did it go the last time you tried to play Daddy?”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl’s face flickered, going ugly and animal for a brief heartbeat. Then he became Lisa.</p><p>No make-up, dark hair tousled from sleep. Dressed in nothing but an old flannel shirt that she loved and Dean always threatened to donate to charity while she was in the shower. He never thought he’d see that ugly old shirt again, and seeing it now made him coldly furious. He refused to be manipulated that easily.</p><p>“She cries every night,” Huehuecoyotl said. His voice was Lisa’s voice, rough with tears. “Alone in the bed you once shared. She is broken inside forever because of you. She wishes she’d never met you.”</p><p>The thing that looked like Lisa stepped closer to him. Close enough that he could smell the vanilla-scented moisturizer she always put on before bed. He clenched his fists.</p><p>“And in her darkest heart,” Huehuecoyotl said looking up at him with Lisa’s big brown eyes, “she wishes Ben had never been born. Because every time she looks at him, she sees you.”</p><p>“Ben is not my son,” Dean said. He could feel a small muscle bunching up and pulsing at the hinge of his jaw. “She did a blood test.”</p><p>“Did she? Interesting how this test was able to eliminate you without a obtaining a sample of your blood. Modern science has made such miraculous advances.”</p><p>Dean narrowed his eyes, defensive.</p><p>“She probably got a sample from that bartender first and it matched, so she didn’t need one from me.”</p><p>“Right,” Huehuecoyotl smiled. “That bartender.”</p><p>Dean didn’t say anything. The doubt that had always been there in the back of his mind was off the leash and raging.</p><p>“Lisa was afraid to tell you the truth because she didn’t want the boy to become a hunter like his father. Especially after you almost killed him.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to him, Dean,” Sam said. “Remember what Xochi said. He’s just messing with you.”</p><p>“Don’t listen to Lisa,” Huehuecoyotl said with a slow smile. “Because, let’s be honest. You don’t really care about Lisa and Ben anymore anyway, do you? I know what you really want.”</p><p>His form flickered again and he became Xochi. Hair unbound, topless and fire lit.</p><p>Claudia ran, sobbing from the circle.</p><p>“Claudia!” Xochi called.</p><p>“Go on,” Dean said. “Go after her. I got this.”</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Go,” he said.</p><p>Xochi turned on her flashlight and ran after Claudia. Sam looked intently at Dean, silently asking him if he was really sure. He was. He didn’t meet his brother’s gaze, keeping his focus on the fake Xochi in front of him.</p><p>“That your best shot, dogboy?” Dean said, raising his eyebrows, defiant. “Because I’m still standing.” He took a step closer to Huehuecoyotl, bringing them nearly nose to nose. “You think I don’t know that I hurt Lisa? That I could have killed Ben? There isn’t a damn thing you can say to me that I don’t already torture myself over, a hundred times a day.”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl didn’t respond.</p><p>“And sure,” Dean continued, on a roll now. “I’d love to nail Xochi. I don’t think that’s exactly breaking news to anyone here, except maybe Claudia, so good job making a teenage girl cry. But you know what? Just because I want to nail Xochi doesn’t mean I will, and that has absolutely nothing to do with how I feel about Lisa and Ben. So, whenever you’re done with your cute little puppet show, you let me know and then maybe we can get down to brass tacks and do some business. What do you say?”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl shifted again, first to a large black coyote and then to a handsome young Native American man with parallel scars on each cheek and heavy obsidian disks in his stretched earlobes.</p><p>“Why should I help you, hunter?” he asked. “And don’t say because the world will end. Your world will end, not mine.”</p><p>“Because it’ll be fun,” Dean replied.</p><h2><span id="chapter-36">CHAPTER 36</span><a href="#chapter-36" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Huehuecoyotl didn’t respond, he just looked intently at Dean. His black eyes shone in the firelight. Dean could feel Sam’s questioning gaze but he didn’t break eye contact with the trickster.</p><p>“If Teo and the Nagual succeed with their plan to piggyback the Star Demons into our world, it’ll be a straight-up massacre,” Dean began. “Now maybe that kind of thing is pretty entertaining to someone like you. But you know what’s even more entertaining than watching a massacre? Watching a war.”</p><p>Dean studied that stony, scarified face, searching for clues. Was it working? Was he getting through? It was impossible to tell.</p><p>“Think about it,” Dean continued. “How would you rather spend your pay-per-view dollars? On a solid, even match-up that you know is gonna go the distance, or a one-sided beat-down that’ll probably end in a first-round knockout? Just give us a fighting chance against these things and we’ll give that Clawed Butterfly bitch a run for her money. It’ll be must see T.V. That’s a promise.”</p><p>“I cannot cure the corrupted Borderwalker,” Huehuecoyotl said.</p><p>Dean forced his clenched fists to open, letting out a slow breath. Huehuecoyotl looked away into the distance, squinting against the smoke from the small fire.</p><p>“But I can help you find someone who can,” he said.</p><p>Dean knew full well that the trickster might be lying, but he finally felt like he had a foot in the door.</p><p>“I’m listening,” Dean said.</p><p>“I will tell you alone,” Huehuecoyotl said. “Tell the empty one to leave us.”</p><p>“Uh uh,” Sam said. “No way.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Sam,” Dean said.</p><p>“I don’t know...”</p><p>“Go on,” Dean said. “I’m good.”</p><p>Sam gave Dean a searching look, then nodded and left the circle.</p><p>“I’m all yours,” Dean said. “Let’s hear it.”</p><p>“I knew a woman once,” Huehuecoyotl told him. “The most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen. Metzlicihuatl was her name. A midwife’s daughter. From the first time I saw her, I knew I had to have her. But once I took what I wanted, she wouldn’t let me go. She became the first Borderwalker. The mother of all the others.”</p><p>“You mean the Alpha?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Yes. The Alpha, as you say.” The trickster gave Dean a knowing look. “She doesn’t care that I broke her heart. She loves me to this day.”</p><p>Dean wasn’t about to let himself be needled when he was so close to what they needed.</p><p>“So you’re saying the Alpha Borderwalker has the power to cure as well as infect?”</p><p>“She still has the lump of white copal that I used to steal her heart. She wears it in a deerskin pouch around her neck. If you can convince her to give it you, you can use it to transform the corrupted Borderwalker back into an ordinary human. I cannot help you convince her, but I can help you call her to you.”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl put out one of his hands and a small ceramic flute took shape, solidifying out of the smoke. It was bright red with a bell-shaped cup at the base, decorated with a trio of bipedal coyotes dancing in a circle. He closed his fingers around the flute and then held it out to Dean.</p><p>“Play this flute,” he said. “Metzlicihuatl will hear it and come to you, thinking you are me. Fair warning, she will be angry when she finds she has been deceived. But you are the kind of man who is easily forgiven by women, aren’t you, Dean?”</p><p>“Where should I play it?” Dean asked, taking the flute. “Here?”</p><p>“Anywhere,” Huehuecoyotl replied. “She would cross oceans to be with me.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Dean said.</p><p>“Just make it worth my while,” the trickster said. “Put on a good show, hunter.”</p><p>“Will do,” Dean said. “We ain’t going down without a fight.”</p><p>“And if you win,” Huehuecoyotl said. “Will you keep on standing alone in the rain? Or will you come inside?”</p><p>Huehuecoyotl leaned close to whisper in Dean’s ear, shifting again as he moved. Shifting back to Xochi.</p><p>“Forgive yourself.”</p><p>The trickster turned and walked away into the desert, Xochi’s image fading slowly into smoky transparency before disappearing all together.</p><p>Dean found Sam, Claudia and Xochi standing together by the dirt bikes. He showed them the flute and explained everything that had happened.</p><p>“Find the Alpha Borderwalker,” Sam said. “Genius. Why didn’t I think of that?”</p><p>“We only have a couple of hours before the sun comes up,” Xochi said. “We don’t want to be out here when that happens. We should head back to the Rover and then find a place to catch a few hours of sleep. We can visit my friend in Chihuahua during the day and then summon the Alpha tomorrow night. Okay?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. “I’m pretty beat.”</p><p>“We all are,” Xochi said.</p><p>Xochi carefully buried the fire and gathered up her ritual objects. Claudia was silent and stoic, waiting. Dean thought maybe he ought to talk to her, apologize or something, but he had absolutely no idea how to even start a conversation like that with a fifteen-year-old girl, so he just kept his mouth shut.</p><p>Sam got his dirt bike started and Claudia climbed on the back, strapping on her helmet. Sam hit the gas and took off down the trail. Xochi was about to mount up on the other when Dean stepped up next to her.</p><p>“I’m sorry about all that,” Dean said. “You know, before. Is Claudia okay?”</p><p>“She will be,” Xochi shrugged. “She’s young. Easily hurt but resilient.”</p><p>She was about to throw one leg over the bike seat, but Dean put a hand on her shoulder, holding her back.</p><p>“Can I ask you a favor?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I remember the way,” he said. “Let me drive the bike back to the Rover.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Honestly?” he said. “Because I don’t think I can take another lap dance like the one I got on the way out here. Have a little compassion, will ya? These are my only pants.”</p><p>She laughed, but she let him drive. They made it back to the Rover without incident.</p><p>Sam was the only one who wasn’t half asleep at that point so he drove while the rest of them dozed. When Dean woke up the sun was starting to rise and the Rover was parked in the lot of a Ramada in Chihuahua. Xochi and Claudia were still asleep in the back seat.</p><p>He got out of the Rover to stretch his aching body and spotted Sam coming out the door, two sets of hotel keys in his hand.</p><p>“Come on,” he called.</p><p>Dean was about to tap on the back window and wake the girls up when Claudia suddenly jolted upright, her movement startling Xochi. Claudia turned to Dean, hand flat against the window and her eyes flashing wide. Then wakeful awareness seemed to filter into her face and she took a deep breath, opening the back door and getting slowly to her feet.</p><p>“I saw her,” Claudia said. “I saw Elvia.”</p><p>Xochi got out of the Rover and came around to stand beside Dean.</p><p>“Tell us,” she said.</p><p>“She...” Claudia paused, frowning. “I think she escaped.”</p><p>Xochi threw a look of surprise in Dean’s direction.</p><p>“You need to remember everything,” she said. “Start at the beginning of your vision. Don’t leave out any details, no matter how small.”</p><p>“Okay,” Claudia said. “It’s just... well it’s kinda mixed up.”</p><p>“Go on,” Dean said.</p><p>“Well, first she was in a dark place, like inside a truck or something. She was... tied up. Bound somehow. Then, cops. Army guys, maybe? Guys in uniforms. There was some kind of nasty fight happening. Shooting and...” Claudia shuddered, wrapping her arms around herself. “And in the chaos, Elvia broke loose and ran. But she’s... sticky. Like one of those poor birds you see on T.V. with the oil all over their feathers. She’s too heavy to leave our world. Does that make sense?”</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “That’s Teo’s magic, holding her down. Can you see where they are? What can she see?”</p><p>Claudia closed her eyes, remembering.</p><p>“It’s a not a major city. More like a town,” she said. “Real pretty and old-fashioned. Narrow, twisty streets. There’s a big church. Tan with a big red dome.”</p><p>Xochi shook her head.</p><p>“That could be anywhere,” she said. “Can you be more specific?”</p><p>“Elvia is hiding in some kind of catacombs,” Claudia said. “With dead bodies all around her. But... this is gonna sound weird.”</p><p>“Nothing sounds weird,” Xochi said.</p><p>“The bodies aren’t in tombs. They’re... It’s almost like they’re... on display. Like in a museum, standing up in these glass cases.”</p><p>Xochi’s eyes went wide.</p><p>“These bodies,” Xochi said. “Are they dried out, like skeletons covered in leathery, pale-brown skin?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Claudia said.</p><p>“Guanajuato,” Xochi said. “They are in Guanajuato.”</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “How long will it take us to get there from here?”</p><p>“If we drive straight through and don’t sleep?” Xochi asked. “Maybe twelve, fourteen hours.”</p><p>“Come on, man,” Dean said. “None of us are gonna be worth a damn if we don’t grab a few hours of real shut-eye. Plus we still need to see your friend who makes the silver ammo and have our little chat with the Alpha Borderwalker.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Xochi said. “But we can’t spare more than three or four hours at the most.”</p><p>“No problem,” Dean said. “That’s all I ever need.”</p><p>“I’ve already got us checked in here,” Sam said. “May as well take advantage. I don’t need to sleep, but I could sure use a shower.”</p><p>“Me too,” Xochi said. “A good hot shower.”</p><p>Their rooms were on the top floor. Sam had splurged on neighboring suites with an adjoining door. Xochi and Claudia took the one on the left and Sam unlocked the one on the right.</p><p>“See you in the morning,” Xochi said. “I mean, later today.”</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “See you.”</p><p>The suite was decent but utterly forgettable. All that Dean cared about was that it was relatively clean and the bathroom door had a lock.</p><p>Sam was setting up his gear on the tiny desk. Dean could hear the shower start up next door. He wondered if it was Xochi.</p><p>“You need to get in there?” Dean asked, gesturing at the bathroom door.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “I’m good,”</p><p>“Because I’m gonna be a while,” Dean said.</p><p>“Have at it, dude.” Sam said without looking up from his laptop. “Do us all a favor.”</p><p>Dean went into the bathroom and locked the door.</p><h2><span id="chapter-37">CHAPTER 37</span><a href="#chapter-37" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Three hours later, Dean felt infinitely more civilized. Rested, as well as ever, and otherwise stabilized. Showered and shaved and caffeinated. Clean socks and underwear. Ready to get out there and save the damn world. Again.</p><p>Xochi’s friend ran a tiny jewelry store just off the main plaza. Touristy stuff mostly. Lots of turquoise and silver mixed in with gothic crosses, bats and skulls. It was a mother-daughter operation. The daughter running the public half of the shop while mom did business out of the back.</p><p>Mom met them at the back door. She was probably close to fifty and dressed like the aftermath of an explosion in the Stevie Nicks factory. Lots of flowing, gauzy lace and frills that hardly seemed like practical work wear for a serious bullet-smith.</p><p>“This is Consuelo Morena Valesquez,” Xochi said. “Sam and Dean Winchester and Claudia Porcayo.”</p><p>“You can call me Chelo,” the older woman replied with a wink. Her English was flawless. “All the hunters do. Especially the handsome ones.” She took Sam’s arm on one side and Dean’s on the other. “Come on in.”</p><p>The back room of the little shop was a scattered mess of bullet molds in varying sizes, ladles, and bricks of pure silver. In the center of the unfinished cement floor was a large cast-iron pot over what looked like the guts of an electric turkey cooker. There was a heavy leather apron on a hook by the door, as well as several pairs of thick, elbow-length gloves and plastic safety goggles. The far wall was covered with Polaroid photos. Chelo posed and smiling beside a hundred different men and women, all heavily armed. All hunters, obviously. It was amazing to Dean how easy it was to recognize other hunters, even in another country. It wasn’t just the guns. It was the eyes. The same eyes he saw every day in the bathroom mirror.</p><p>“Xochi tells me you have a problem with the Nagual,” Chelo said. “I have a shorty I might be able to spare. What do you have to trade?”</p><p>Xochi and Dean emptied their pockets of all the weapons they’d stolen from the phony federales back in Nogales. Chelo picked up the weighty Magnum.</p><p>“.50 caliber?” She whistled appreciatively. “I’d love to take this one, but it sounds like you need it more than I do. Lucky for you, I just poured a fresh rack of 50s last night.”</p><p>She turned to a large cabinet and unlocked it with a key that hung from a chain around her neck. After a moment of searching through inner drawers, she turned and handed Dean a sawed-off Mossberg 500.</p><p>“You know what,” she said. “Just take it. But in return I want a photo with you two handsome boys.”</p><p>“You got it,” Sam said.</p><p>She handed an old-school Polaroid camera to Xochi. Sam and Dean both had to slouch down to keep their heads in frame with the petite bullet-smith. Xochi took the shot and handed the developing photo to Chelo.</p><p>“Thanks,” Chelo said, waving the photo in the air.</p><p>Once the image came in, she smiled and pinned the snapshot up on the wall beside an old photo of Xochi that Dean hadn’t noticed until just then. In the picture Xochi looked about Claudia’s age. No tattoos. Her hair was shorter, chopped into blunt bangs. She was trying for a stony bad ass stare that wasn’t quite there yet. Kind of reminded Dean of himself at that age.</p><p>“Okay,” Chelo said. “So you need 50s, 45s, and 38s, plus the 12-gauge slugs for the Mossberg. Anything else?”</p><p>“Got any silver knives?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Of course,” she said, like he’d just asked if the Pope was Catholic. “How many you need?”</p><p>“Three,” Dean said.</p><p>“Four,” Claudia said.</p><p>“No,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Xochi said. “She has to learn sometime.”</p><p>“You’d better teach her how to throw it,” Dean said. “Because I’m still not letting anything get close enough to be inside her range. I promised I’d protect her and I meant it.”</p><p>That was the wrong thing to say. Claudia was looking at him all sparkle-eyed again. Apparently last night’s embarrassing revelations had done nothing to dim her crush.</p><p>Chelo smirked and headed off into a small storeroom.</p><p>“We’d better divvy up the firepower while we’re at it,” Sam said. “Dean, you take the shotgun.”</p><p>“Right,” Dean hefted the Mossberg, checking it over. “What about you? You want the Magnum?”</p><p>“Don’t need it,” Sam said with a smirk. “I got nothing to prove in that department.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Xochi said. “But you also have the largest hands. Me, I prefer the .45.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Sam said, picking up the hand cannon. “That leaves Claudia with the snubbie.”</p><p>Claudia reached for the .38 and Xochi grabbed her wrist.</p><p>“Not yet,” she said. “I’ll hold it for you until I have a chance to teach you how to use it. I don’t want you to shoot your foot. Or mine.”</p><p>When Chelo returned she had a huge, teetering stack of unmarked ammo boxes. Xochi stepped up to help her, taking about half the boxes and laying them out on the workbench.</p><p>“Dean?” She tossed him a box.</p><p>He opened the lid and saw what looked like a dozen ordinary shotgun rounds. But when he pulled one out and turned it over, instead of the usual star-shaped top, he saw a solid, gleaming silver slug with a flattened top and a deep dimpled center.</p><p>“Hollow point?” he said. “Hot damn.”</p><p>“Like you Americans always say,” Chelo said. “Ideal for home defense.”</p><p>Dean loaded up while Sam and Xochi expelled the standard rounds from their respective firearms and reloaded with silver.</p><p>“Here you go, muñeca,” Chelo said to Claudia, handing her a slim silver stiletto with an image of the Virgin Mary on the handle. She leaned in to stage whisper, “I gave you the best one.”</p><p>She handed out three other, plainer knives, one to each of them, and then dug up a sturdy leather backpack to carry all the ammo.</p><p>“Thanks, Chelo,” Xochi said, filling up the pack. “You’re the best.”</p><p>“Don’t you forget it,” Chelo said. “It was a pleasure doing business with you, as always. And you American boys, remember, I ship international. You can order online, anytime.”</p><p>She handed Sam a business card with a web address and a lot of gothy-looking clip art. He smiled and slipped it into his wallet.</p><p>Xochi shouldered the pack and laid a thick roll of Mexican money on Chelo. Chelo tried to refuse in Spanish, but Xochi insisted. Chelo gave Claudia a big hug and then kissed both Sam and Dean full on the mouth.</p><p>“Come back any time,” she said.</p><p>Xochi sold the two dirt bikes and the trailer to another friend before they left Chihuahua, arguing that they had a lot of miles to cover and they could drive faster without the trailer. Dean had been thinking the same thing.</p><p>“So where should we stop to try and summon the Alpha Borderwalker?” Sam asked as he pulled the Rover onto Carretera Federal 45.</p><p>“Anywhere along the way, I guess,” Dean replied. “Just make it somewhere pretty far from any kind of civilization.”</p><p>“Do you see anything around here that looks like civilization?” Sam asked, gesturing through the dusty windshield at the long flat stretch of nothing they were passing through.</p><p>“That’s for the best,” Dean said. “If she’s gonna be anywhere near as pissed off as the coyote guy said she’d be, I don’t want any innocent bystanders hanging around. In fact, that might be a good time for you guys to teach Claudia how to shoot.”</p><p>“We’re not letting you face the Alpha alone,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Trust me on this,” Dean said. “I can handle it.”</p><p>“No way,” Claudia said. “That’s crazy.”</p><p>“No,” Xochi said. “No, I’ll come with you. You need someone to have your back.”</p><p>“Look,” Dean said. “Don’t think I don’t appreciate the offer, but I’m the most expendable person in this group and you know it. You’re our native guide, Claudia’s our tracker and Sam, well whatever mystical reason you have for thinking you need him to succeed in this hunt, I’m not gonna argue with you on that. That leaves me.”</p><p>“He’s right,” Sam said.</p><p>“How can you say that?” Claudia asked.</p><p>“Tell ‘em, Sammy,” he said. “I’m just trying to be practical here.”</p><p>Xochi swore quietly in Spanish.</p><p>“I hate it, but I cannot argue,” she said.</p><p>“But you were the one who said we all need to stay together from now on,” Claudia said to her. “You’re just gonna let him walk off and get killed?”</p><p>“This ain’t my first rodeo, kid,” Dean said. “I’m not gonna get killed, I’m gonna get that damn chunk of copal. And when I come back, I want to see you shoot the ace out of the ace of spades. Deal?”</p><p>“Fine,” Claudia said, turning her face away and staring out the window at the non-scenery. “I don’t care anyway.”</p><p>“Atta girl,” Dean said. “Sam, why don’t you take that little side road there. Just get us a few miles off the main drag.”</p><p>They passed a few little shack-like dwellings and a sort of roadside restaurant, then more nothing. The sun was starting to slide down into a smoldering-red sunset.</p><p>“Here,” Xochi said, pointing to a stubbly rock formation on the right.</p><p>Sam pulled the Rover off the road and killed the engine. The four of them got out and Claudia threw her arms around Dean’s neck, smashing her face into his chest. He patted her back and then pulled away.</p><p>“Hey, what did I tell you?” he said. “I’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Be careful,” she said. “Promise me you will. We need you.”</p><p>“Claudia,” Xochi said. “Get the ammo bag and a couple of those plastic bottles out of the back.”</p><p>“Go on,” Dean said.</p><p>Claudia looked up at him, then stood up on her tiptoes to press a lightning-quick kiss to his cheek.</p><p>“Good luck,” she said, blushing like a house on fire and turning back to the Rover.</p><p>Xochi came over to Dean and held out her flask. He took it. Took a slug. Tried to give it back, but she shook her head.</p><p>“Take it,” she said. “And this.”</p><p>She pulled out her sacred, snake-handled stone knife. Spun it in her grip so that the handle was facing him and held it out.</p><p>“It’s not obsidian,” she said. “But it’s better than nothing.”</p><p>He held her gaze for a moment, then nodded and took it.</p><p>“Thanks,” he said.</p><p>“Just bring it back,” she said.</p><p>She didn’t hug him or kiss him. She just turned without another word and walked back to the Rover. He wrapped his fingers around the sinuously carved handle. It was still warm from her hand. He silently promised her that he would bring it back.</p><p>He walked away, into the desert.</p><h2><span id="chapter-38">CHAPTER 38</span><a href="#chapter-38" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean walked toward the sunset until he couldn’t see the Rover anymore. The sound of Claudia’s target practice gradually faded into the distance. He couldn’t see any man-made structures anywhere. He couldn’t see the road or the car. He was utterly, completely alone. He eventually slowed and then stopped.</p><p>Reaching into his pocket, he took out the flute Huehuecoyotl had given him. He held it up, turning it over and over in his hand. It hadn’t occurred to him until that second that he had absolutely no idea how to play a flute. He’d never even touched one, not even a toy when he was a kid. The only toy instrument he’d ever had was a drum, and his frequently hung-over father had told him that it had “got lost” only two or three days after Christmas.</p><p>The flute had four holes in it, evenly spaced along the top. It was pretty obvious that you were supposed to put your mouth on the skinny end and blow into it, but he had no idea what the holes were for.</p><p>He lifted the flute to his lips and blew experimentally into it. The breathy, resonant note that came out was so achingly beautiful that it startled him into momentary silence. It was an inexplicably sexy sound, like a woman’s knowing, intimate laughter. The kind of laugh that let you know you were in. That you’d gone from flirting to making love for the first time. That she was yours.</p><p>Dean shook his head to clear it and raised the flute to his lips again, ready this time for the seductive effect of the music. He moved his fingertips over the top of the flute and realized that he could make the tone move up or down by covering or uncovering the holes. He was nowhere near an actual song or anything, but he was able to sustain several varying notes that echoed out over the ancient landscape like a beacon.</p><p>The air around him began to shimmer and blur. An undulating ribbon of soft white light appeared, bisecting the sunset and forming a deepening rift in the skin of the sky. The Alpha Borderwalker appeared out of the rift, the strange shimmer clinging to her long black hair as she stepped down onto the sand as casually as if she were getting off a train.</p><p>Huehuecoyotl had said that she was the most beautiful woman he’d ever seen, and he obviously wasn’t lying. She was absolutely breathtaking. Dean had always been partial to women with dark hair and eyes and she was a stunning example of his ideal type. Wide-set, mesmerizing espresso eyes behind heavy black lashes. Impossibly lush mouth.</p><p>Regal cheekbones. Flawless without a hint of make-up. But something about her beauty was disturbing. It was too perfect, so unreal that it was almost terrifying. Monstrous. Inhuman.</p><p>She was nude, but the soft, brown human skin below her collarbones graduated into sleek, mottled scales like a rattlesnake, making her luscious curves seem almost clothed. Her fingers ended in hooked black claws. An enormous pair of black-and-white condor’s wings sprouted from her shoulder blades, flexing and stretching wide, stirring the sand around Dean’s boots. This was a magnificent, terrible creature. Nothing like the miserable, tortured abomination they’d battled back in the States. This was what a Borderwalker was supposed to be.</p><p>“Who are you?” she asked, her voluptuous lips unmoving, as if her words were being whispered directly into Dean’s mind. “You are not my lover.”</p><p>The flute in his hand turned to smoke, drifting away on the desert wind. He stood his ground, unflinching.</p><p>“Huehuecoyotl sent me,” Dean said. “He told me that you would help me.”</p><p>Her heavy eyebrows bunched together into a slight frown. She took a step closer, the rich, amber-like scent of copal dizzying at close range, and reached out a talon-tipped finger to touch his throat, just below the line of his jaw. He could feel Xochi’s stone knife pressed against the small of his back, tucked into the waistband of his jeans, but there was no way to get to it in time to stop her from slitting his throat ear to ear if that’s what she wanted.</p><p>“I do not help human men,” she said.</p><p>“This help,” he said. “It’s not for me. It’s for a woman. Her name is Elvia Reveultas.”</p><p>“Elvia,” she said, the name barely louder than a breath inside Dean’s head.</p><p>“You know her?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I know what has been done to her,” the Alpha said. “I could do worse to you, human. With pleasure.”</p><p>She caressed his throat with the flat of her palm, the sharp point of her thumbnail sliding up into the soft spot behind his ear. He needed to think fast. To say something. Anything.</p><p>“Wow,” he said. “This really isn’t the kind of welcome I was expecting.”</p><p>“You know nothing about me,” she said, unmoving lips inches from his. “Or my welcome.”</p><p>“I just meant...” He swallowed against the crush of her hand on his trachea. “After everything that Huehuecoyotl said about you...”</p><p>She released some of the pressure on his neck.</p><p>“What did he say about me?” she asked.</p><p>“Nothing important,” Dean said. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Tell me,” she said. “Or I will gut you and leave you for the vultures.”</p><p>This was way too easy.</p><p>“Well it wasn’t so much what he said.” Dean shrugged. “You know how guys are. We hate coming right out and saying how we feel, but...” He paused. Let her hang for a second. “The way he talks about you, he’s obviously still crazy about you.”</p><p>“You lie,” she said. “You lie like he does.”</p><p>Of course he was lying, but, like he’d told Claudia, this wasn’t his first rodeo. Dean was a professional. A black belt, grandmaster, superfly liar. He’d been lying all his life and he knew that the easiest lie to sell is the one that someone really wants to believe.</p><p>“Yeah, what do I know?” Dean said. “I must be wrong.”</p><p>He turned like he was going to walk away. She let him, hands held palm up and open. He took a step, then another. Then, that sibilant whisper inside his head.</p><p>“Tell me what he said.”</p><p>“He told me about the time he spent with you,” Dean said, turning back to her. “I think that was the only time when he was ever really happy. He said you made him feel human.”</p><p>She was listening intently, claws clicking as she nervously opened and closed her hands.</p><p>“He still carries this awful guilt over what happened to you,” Dean continued. “He only left you because he wanted to protect you and ended up hurting you anyway.”</p><p>“I don’t understand,” she said. “Protect me from what?”</p><p>“Protect you from his own inner darkness,” Dean told her. “He knew he could never be the kind of man you deserve. That loving him would only bring you pain.”</p><p>She took a half a step back, wings folding inward and dark eyes suddenly wet with very human tears. Dean had to look away from the weeping monster, because he was starting to wonder who was the real monster here. That didn’t stop him from moving in for the checkmate.</p><p>“He wanted to help Elvia,” Dean said. “To make up for not being able to help you. But he can’t. Only you can save her now.”</p><p>“I know the pain of all my daughters,” she said. “Elvia’s pain, it is unspeakable.”</p><p>“Then help me help her,” Dean said.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>Dean frowned. For some reason, in all the time he’d spent scoping her snakeskin cleavage, he never noticed she was not wearing a necklace. Not until that moment.</p><p>“Huehuecoyotl said that you still have the lump of white copal that he gave you.” Dean touched his sternum. “He told me you kept it in a deerskin pouch around your neck, but...”</p><p>Her mouth twisted into a smile and Dean heard a low smoky laugh echo inside his head.</p><p>“A necklace?” she said. “That’s what he told you?”</p><p>She delicately circled her own sternum with a clawtip. The heart beneath her skin began to flicker, pulsing with a hot, ruddy glow.</p><p>“That lump of copal is deeply embedded inside my heart,” she said. “Just like the man who gave it to me. I cannot give it to you any more than I could give you my own beating heart.”</p><p>Dean made a solemn promise to kick that shifty coyote in the nards the next time he saw him.</p><p>“You know him,” Dean said. “Probably better than anyone.” Dean tried to remember what Xochi said about Huehuecoyotl. “His lies are more revealing than the truth, right? What do you think he really meant?”</p><p>“I have never tried to take away my affliction,” she said. “Only share it.”</p><p>Dean thought back to the cure Bobby had mixed up for him when Dean had been turned into a vampire. One of the main ingredients was the blood of the vamp that turned him. Clearly the Borderwalker that turned Elvia was dead, killed in the transition, but if these Borderwalkers have copal smoke for blood, then maybe all of them share the same smoke flowing through their veins. Smoke from the original piece of copal, currently burning inside the Alpha’s heart.</p><h2><span id="chapter-39">CHAPTER 39</span><a href="#chapter-39" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Okay, look,” Dean said. “Don’t take this the wrong way or anything, but can I...? Well...” He thought of the Monty Python sketch where they take out that guy’s liver while he’s still alive. There was really no good way to ask a question like this. “Can I have some of your blood?”</p><p>“My blood?”</p><p>“I know it’s a lot to ask on a first date—“ Dean began.</p><p>“Give me some of your blood, human,” she replied. “Or how about I just take it? All of it.”</p><p>She took a step closer and he backed up, showing his palms.</p><p>“Okay, okay,” he said. “What I mean is, I think that’s what Huehuecoyotl was talking about when he said I could use the lump of copal he gave you to cure Elvia.” He knew he was on a highwire with this. One wrong step and he was screwed. “He didn’t really mean I should take the whole thing. He wanted you to give me some of your blood.”</p><p>“And if I do...”</p><p>He waited, afraid to push too hard.</p><p>“You understand that my blood is smoke?” She tilted her head. “How do you propose to carry smoke?”</p><p>“Right,” he said. “Yeah, well...”</p><p>Good question. How the hell was he going to carry smoke? More than that, how was he gonna get it out of her body and into whatever he was going to carry it in?</p><p>She slid one of her hands around his body and down over his butt cheek. For a second he though she was trying to cop a feel, but she took Xochi’s flask out of his back pocket and unscrewed the cap.</p><p>“Hey wait...” he tried to say, but she emptied the flask into the sand before he could finish. “What did you do that for? I could have emptied that for you.”</p><p>“You will have to breathe my blood,” she said.</p><p>“Wait, what?”</p><p>“Breathe my blood,” she said. “And then blow it into this flask.”</p><p>“Are you sure about that?” Dean frowned.</p><p>“Do you want my blood or don’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” he said. “Of course.”</p><p>“Remember,” she said. “I do this for him. Not for you.”</p><p>Dean considered himself to be pretty open-minded, but what happened next was probably up there in the top ten weirdest things he’d ever done with a naked woman. Well sort of naked. Sort of a woman. Anyway it was pretty damn weird.</p><p>She wrapped her fingers around the back of his neck, claws sliding up through his hair in a way that was kind of sexy and kind of creepy at the same time. With her other hand, she pressed the claw of her index finger to her left breast. Her skin parted between the snake scales and thick, perfumed smoke began to flow from the cut. She pulled his head down to her breast.</p><p>“Breathe,” she said.</p><p>As he put his lips around the edge of the cut, it occurred to him that he really shouldn’t actually breathe the smoke into his lungs. He was no Bill Clinton, but he had no way of knowing if any kind of microscopic particles of it might be absorbed into the tissues of his lungs, diluting and weakening the blood that he exhaled. It had to be full strength and they weren’t likely to get a refill.</p><p>He could feel his cheeks puffing up like Satchmo as he sucked at the smoke, trying very hard not to think about how utterly weird and wrong this was in every possible way. When he’d filled his mouth up as much as he possibly could, he pulled away, eyes watering and motioning for the flask. She handed it to him and he wrapped his lips around the neck, letting the smoke flow out, filling the flask. He screwed the cap on tight.</p><p>He coughed, feeling sure that he’d gotten her blood up his nose. That heavy amber scent felt embedded in his sinuses. The tissues inside his mouth felt dry and strange. He was so thirsty that sucking on the sand where the Alpha had poured out Xochi’s whisky was starting to seem like a really good idea. He pocketed the flask and tried to think of something clever to say. Nothing came to mind. Talk about awkward.</p><p>“Wow, yeah, okay,” he said. “So, thanks for that. I’ll call you sometime.”</p><p>She didn’t answer. She just stretched out her arms in a crucifixion pose, closed her eyes and fell backward. Before she hit the sand, the sky opened and swallowed her. In an instant, she was gone.</p><p>Dean really hoped this was going to work.</p><p>When Dean finally made it back to the Rover, it was full dark. Xochi and Claudia were still shooting, using the headlights for illumination. Xochi was standing behind Claudia, shaking the girl’s shoulders to try and loosen up her posture. Claudia still looked tense, her whole body flinching with every shot. But she was hitting the plastic bottles more often than she was missing.</p><p>When Dean called out to them Claudia turned to him, gun pointed unthinkingly in his direction. Xochi grabbed Claudia’s arm and pushed it down so the barrel pointed at the ground, slapping the girl in the back of the head with her free hand.</p><p>“Don’t ever point a gun at something you don’t intend to kill,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Sorry,” Claudia said, scolded puppy eyes all remorseful for a fleeting second, then bounding enthusiastically over to Dean.</p><p>To his surprise, she didn’t throw her arms around him, although she obviously wanted to.</p><p>“Well?” she asked.</p><p>“What can I say?” he asked, pulling the flask and shaking it. “Chicks dig me.”</p><p>“What is it?” Xochi asked. “Not whisky?”</p><p>“Blood,” he said. “From the Alpha Borderwalker. Let’s get on the road and I’ll tell you the whole story.”</p><p>Dean took the first shift driving, explaining what had happened with the Alpha, but leaving out the details of how he had talked her into helping him.</p><p>“So let’s say this works,” Sam said. “Which we really have no way of testing until it’s too late. But say it does, how are we supposed to administer this blood to our Borderwalker? You can’t put smoke in a syringe. Or can you?”</p><p>“Maybe you need to breath it into her mouth,” Xochi said.</p><p>“And you think she’s just gonna let me make out with her?” Dean asked. “What if she bites my lips off?”</p><p>“I thought you said chicks dig you,” Xochi said. “I’m sure you can convince her.”</p><p>“Hey,” Claudia said. “This is my mom we’re talking about here.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Dean said.</p><p>“I’ll call Bobby,” Sam said. “We’ll see if he has any ideas. Meanwhile, we’d better stop for chow and supplies.”</p><p>A while later they pulled into a strange little roadside stand that was the only thing open for miles. It was mostly outdoors with a tin roof on four poles covering a few cheap tables and a terrifying out-house kind of toilet with an old lady sitting on a lawn chair by the door. She had a moustache like Burt Reynolds. It took Dean a second to realize that she was selling toilet paper. By the individual square.</p><p>Xochi and Claudia ordered a big mess of mysterious food, which turned out to be blazingly spicy and amazingly good, even after Dean found out that it was actually goat meat.</p><p>After they finished their meal, Dean and Xochi headed over to the cooler for more beer. Claudia was buying something from a candy vendor. When she turned toward Dean, he saw that it was a pack of cigarettes. He watched her open it and stick one in the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Hey,” he said. “You can’t smoke.”</p><p>“Why not?” She pulled out a lighter and lit the cigarette. “Because it’s bad for me? We’re all probably gonna die anyway.”</p><p>Dean took the cigarette out of her mouth and dropped it to the ground, crushing it under his boot heel.</p><p>“Because you’re fifteen,” Dean said. “And because I say so.”</p><p>He held out his hand for the pack. She frowned.</p><p>“What,” Claudia said. “It’s okay for you to get all bombed every night, but I can’t have one cigarette?”</p><p>“That’s right,” Dean said. “You know why? Because I’m over twenty-one and you aren’t. Don’t like it, you can write your local congressman.”</p><p>“We’re not even in America,” Claudia said.</p><p>“I said no,” Dean said. “And that’s final. Now gimme.”</p><p>Dean was expecting a big teenage tantrum, but she just bowed her head and handed him the pack. Dean handed the cigarettes back to the vendor, who gave Claudia a ziploc bag full of strange pastel-colored candies instead.</p><p>“You are a good daddy,” Xochi said to Dean, watching Claudia walk back to their table with her candy.</p><p>Xochi paid the beer lady, handed a beer to Dean, then took one for herself and cracked the cap using an opener on a chain locked to the handle of the cooler. Dean thought about his own father. About Ben and what Huehuecoyotl had said. He opened his beer.</p><p>“I think that’s what her crush on you is really all about,” Xochi said, taking a swig from her bottle. “She just wants someone to zip her up inside his jacket.”</p><p>Dean nodded. He took a swallow of his beer. There wasn’t anything he could do about that. He was going to do everything he could to protect that kid, but it would ultimately be up to her to sink or swim.</p><h2><span id="chapter-40">CHAPTER 40</span><a href="#chapter-40" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Before they left, Xochi bought a bottle of tequila and some purified water. While Sam gassed up the Rover, Dean bought three weird, bootleg CDs from a blind kid who had his wares spread out on a plastic tablecloth by the side of the road. Dean paid a dollar for all three. Probably outrageously over-priced, but he didn’t care.</p><p>“We’re covered tune-wise for the rest of the drive,” Dean said, showing the CDs to Xochi. “Check this out. This is gonna be Sam’s new favorite disk right here.”</p><p>He held up a disk that was hand-labeled “SEX ROCK!!!” No information at all about what was actually on the disk. The other two were labeled “Lo Mejor de Led Zeppelin” and “Los Grandes Exitos de CLASSIC ROCK.”</p><p>When they got back on the road, Xochi took the wheel and Dean rode shotgun, playing DJ with his new disks. The Zep CD was just what you’d expect and the “Classic” one was an interesting mix of obvious hits with more obscure tracks, but the “SEX ROCK” disk was the clear winner of the bunch. An astoundingly cheesy grab-bag of dirty hair-metal songs that seemed scientifically engineered to the precise specifications that would most annoy his brother.</p><p>Three songs in and Sam and Claudia were ready to stage a bloody mutiny against Dean. He responded to their threats by singing along. When “Hot Cherie” by Hardline came on, it got immediately rewritten by Dean as “Hot Xochi.”</p><p>“You get me hot, Xochi,” he sang, loud and shamelessly off-key. “I want what you’ve got all over me.”</p><p>“You want this all over you?” she asked, showing him a gloved fist.</p><p>Dean ignored her, singing even louder.</p><p>“I’m ready to rock you long and rough!”</p><p>Xochi swore in Spanish and hit the skip button on the CD player. Next up was “Smooth Up In Ya” by the Bulletboys.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said from the back seat. “I’m about ready to throw that damn CD out the window. I never thought I’d actually say this, but why don’t you put Led Zeppelin back on.”</p><p>“Witnesses!” Dean said, pointing to Xochi and Claudia. “You both heard him say that.”</p><p>“If I have to hear ‘Misty Mountain Hop’ one more time,” Claudia said. “I’m going to shoot everyone in this car. I can do that now, you know.”</p><p>“In fact,” Sam said. “You know what? Pull over. It’s my turn to drive. Claudia, you got shotgun. I’m leaving the tunes up to you.”</p><p>“Yes!” Claudia said, fist in the air.</p><p>“No way,” Dean said. “This is not a musical democracy.”</p><p>“It is now,” Sam said.</p><p>The fact that Dean was still able to get on Sam’s nerves with his musical selection was weirdly reassuring. It was one of the few connections that he still had with this stranger in his brother’s skin. It gave him hope that Sam really was still in there.</p><p>Xochi pulled over onto the dusty shoulder and got out from behind the wheel, stretching her arms up high above her head. Dean got out too.</p><p>“You giving up?” Dean asked Xochi. “Just like that? I thought you were on my side.”</p><p>“I’m not giving up,” she said. She pulled out the bottle of tequila and cracked the cap. “I just know when it’s time to let someone else drive.”</p><p>She took a slug and then handed the bottle to Dean.</p><p>“Good point,” he said. “I’ll drink to that.”</p><p>Settled into the back seat with Xochi and the bottle, Dean realized that he was probably in for another night of sleeping with her but not really sleeping with her. This was going to require very careful calculation of alcohol consumption on his part. It either had to be less than the amount that would having him thinking it would be a good idea to make a play for her right then and there or else it had to be so much that something like that wasn’t even an option and he’d just pass out. Judging by the size of the bottle and the fact that he was sharing it with a thirsty girl like Xochi, he was thinking he’d better go with option A.</p><p>Claudia was searching across the radio dial when a lush, dream-like song came on featuring a melancholy male singer crooning in Spanish.</p><p>“This is Caifanes,” Xochi said. “‘Los Dioses Occultos.’ I love this song.”</p><p>“Cool,” Claudia said. “Sounds almost like a Mexican version of The Cure.”</p><p>This sort of music was way too girly for Dean, but he wasn’t really listening anyway. He looked out the window at the black nothingness they were driving through and then down at the bottle. Thought about what they were driving into. About the fact that this was probably the calm before the storm. Their last quiet night. He took his last swallow of tequila and handed it back to Xochi. Watched her drink. She offered the bottle back to him and he shook his head.</p><p>“I’m good,” he said.</p><p>She looked at him with questioning eyes, then shrugged and took another pull.</p><p>The hypnotic, drowsy music had a soporific effect on everybody in the car. Everyone but Sam, driving silently and lost in his own unknowable thoughts. Claudia had curled up like a cat in the front seat. Dean felt weary and tired, but still wound-up and unable to completely relax. There was nothing to look at in the dark cocoon of the Rover except Xochi. He watched her wrap her lips around the mouth of the nearly empty bottle, the muscles in her long neck working as she swallowed. She was making short work of that tequila.</p><p>“It is funny, no?” she asked.</p><p>She was watching him too.</p><p>“What’s funny?” he asked.</p><p>“I will admit to you something about myself,” she said. As she drank, her English got rougher, blurry around the edges. “I have never sleep together with a man as many times as I sleep with you.” She shook her head, waving the hand that held the bottle. “Only one other man. My husband. Ex-husband.” She shrugged. “With lovers, I do not sleep. I make love, and then I leave.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean said. He looked away, at the dark nothing outside the window. “Me, too.”</p><p>She downed the very last of the tequila and let the empty bottle drop to the floor behind the driver’s seat.</p><p>“Sex is not trust,” she said. “Sleep is trust. And trust is difficult for me.”</p><p>He didn’t say me too again. He didn’t need to.</p><p>“But I trust you, Dean,” she said. “You and Sam. I shouldn’t, but I do. You are like my family.”</p><p>Dean had no idea what to say in response to something like that. She clearly had quite a buzz going and was veering dangerous close to I frickin love you, man kind of drunk buddy talk. Under different circumstances it would be way too easy for Dean to steer that kind of talk in an entirely different direction.</p><p>“Speaking of sleep,” he said instead. “We should probably get some. It’s gonna be dawn before you know it.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “You are right.”</p><p>She slid across the seat and laid her head down on his chest. He just sat there for a minute, stunned and unsure what to do with his arms. Eventually, he gave in and put them around her so he wouldn’t have to keep holding them up the air. She snuggled against him with a wordless, sleepy noise, her hand sliding across his belly and around his waist. He looked up and saw Sam watching him in the rearview mirror with smug amusement. It was going to be a long night.</p><h2><span id="chapter-41">CHAPTER 41</span><a href="#chapter-41" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi woke up in the back seat of the Rover with her face pressed into Dean’s armpit. She looked up at him and saw that he was not sleeping. He was looking down at her with his stubbled mouth twisted into a smirk.</p><p>“How’s my deodorant holding up?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not so good,” she said, sitting up and sliding away from him.</p><p>“Admit it,” Dean said. “You kinda like my man stink, don’t you?”</p><p>She could feel her cheeks flush hot. She would rather die than admit it to him, but she did. The raw, natural scent of men’s bodies had always played a major yet not entirely conscious part in her decision to have sex with them. It didn’t matter how good-looking they were, if she didn’t like their scent, it wasn’t going to happen. And if she did, well, then they were a lot harder to ignore.</p><p>“Where are we?” she asked Sam, pushing a few stray strands of hair out of her eyes and peering out through the window.</p><p>They were no longer in the middle of nowhere. The road was lined with tire shops and garages, bars and warehouses and storefront churches. Still mostly closed. There was the slightest flush of dawn on the edge of the eastern sky.</p><p>“Just outside Guanajuato,” he replied. “We’ll be there before the sun comes up.”</p><p>“I think we should...” she began.</p><p>Claudia cut her off with a sharp gasp, suddenly sitting bolt upright in the passenger seat.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“They’re coming,” she whispered.</p><p>A Nagual woman leapt up onto the hood of the Rover, fist smashing through the driver’s side of the windshield and shifting from a human hand to a broad panther paw.</p><p>Sam swerved, fighting to keep control of the big, unresponsive Rover on the rough road. The Nagual swiped at him with her claws, slashing his shirt. To Xochi’s surprise, Claudia reacted quickly and efficiently by drawing the snub-nosed .38 and firing through the hole in the glass. She hit the Nagual in the chest and the creature shrieked and rolled off the hood.</p><p>There was a brief, almost comical moment where Xochi and Dean both drew their guns and tried simultaneously to push each other protectively back and out of harm’s way. It took less than a full second for them to focus in on the danger and start working together to get Claudia out of the front seat. The front passenger side window shattered as Dean reached around the seat and hit the lever that dropped it straight back, while Xochi grabbed Claudia and hauled her backward, into the back seat between them.</p><p>Five or six huge crows swooped and dove around the roof of the car while another panther-woman ran beside the smashed passenger window, human from the waist up and holding a thin black reed to her lips.</p><p>“Are you hit?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t think...” Claudia began.</p><p>One of the crows dive-bombed the windshield, shattering the already cracked glass and shifting swiftly into a man with long black hair, crouching on the front seat and reaching for Claudia with black clawed hands still hooked and bird-like.</p><p>Dean let the Nagual have it with the shotgun at point-blank range. The thunderous sound was deafening inside the car and the crow man’s entire upper half disintegrated into a spray of glowing cinders and feathers. Xochi could see but not hear Dean let out an exuberant cowboy whoop. She pushed Claudia’s head down and took aim at another crow circling the car. The first shot missed but the second hit, sending the bird spiraling and shifting until it hit the ground fully human.</p><p>Xochi saw Dean grab Sam’s shoulder, mouth making the shape of his brother’s name, probably yelling, though she still couldn’t hear. She saw that Sam was driving with one hand, the other on the side of his neck. A thin, feathered dart was sticking out from between his fingers. He swerved to avoid an oncoming truck and then slumped over the wheel, laying on the horn as the Rover left the road and slammed into the flimsy wall of a neighboring warehouse.</p><p>The back door on the driver’s side flew open, throwing Xochi and Claudia out onto the oily concrete floor while the Rover plowed into a large stack of boxes filled with plastic flip-flop sandals.</p><p>Xochi rolled into a crouch and tried to stand, but the damaged structure of the building was giving way, heavy beams crashing down all around her. She ducked and weaved through the chaos, trying to make her way to Claudia, when something hit her in the back of the head, making the world go red.</p><p>She staggered and fell to her knees, palms on the concrete. She didn’t seem to have her gun. Her hearing was starting to come back and she thought she heard Claudia screaming her name but her vision was blurred and eclipsed with spangles. She felt around her on the floor until her fingers found the handle of the .45.</p><p>“Dean,” she called. “Dean, protect Claudia!”</p><p>She shook her head to clear it and struggled to her feet, forcing her eyes to focus. Sam was still slumped behind the wheel. Dean had just shoved the other back door open and was crawling out, shotgun in one hand and ammo bag in the other, squinting against the blood that flowed from a cut just below his hairline.</p><p>Claudia was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Xochi ran to the massive hole the Rover had torn in the warehouse wall. She was just in time to see a trio of crows carrying Claudia away, one clutching each shoulder of her shirt, the other the waistband of her jeans. She hung ragdoll loose in their grip. Not struggling, probably not conscious. Maybe not even alive. Xochi didn’t dare fire at the Nagual, for fear they would drop Claudia to her death. If she wasn’t dead already.</p><p>Xochi sank to her knees in the street, gun falling from her numb fingers.</p><h2><span id="chapter-42">CHAPTER 42</span><a href="#chapter-42" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Dean crawled free of the wrecked Rover, he couldn’t see Xochi or Claudia anywhere, but all he could think about was Sam. The first thing he did when he got himself up on his feet was to run to the driver’s door and pull Sam out from behind the wheel. Sam was limp, a dead weight lolling against Dean’s chest as he half dragged, half carried his brother away from the leaking wreck.</p><p>“Sammy,” Dean said. “Come on, don’t do this to me, man. If you’re dead again, I swear I’m gonna frickin’ kill you.”</p><p>Dean’s legs felt weak as he got Sam out of the collapsing building and laid him out on the side of the road. A small crowd of curious spectators had gathered, advising Dean in Spanish and waving their arms. He ignored them, concentrating on his brother.</p><p>He pressed his ear to Sam’s lips listening for breath. Nothing. He pulled the dart out of Sam’s neck and then felt around for a pulse. It was there, but barely, weak and slow.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “Okay, stay with me Sammy. You hear me? Stay with me.”</p><p>This hunt had been a bad idea from the beginning. This wasn’t just some entertaining little side bet, this was a nightmare that kept on getting worse with every turn. He should have never agreed to do this, he should have kept on pushing to try and find a way to get Sam’s soul back. Because as furious as he may have been when Sam let him get turned by that vamp, as much as it hurt him that this new version of Sam didn’t care if Dean lived or died, he just couldn’t bring himself to give up on the kid. He’d come close, more than once, but in the end, blood was blood, and Sam was all he had left.</p><p>Kneeling there in the dust with his brother’s barely breathing body in his arms, Dean realized suddenly that he didn’t have a clue what would happen to Sam’s soul if his body died. Would it stay trapped in that cage for eternity? There was no way Dean was going to let that happen. They were so deep into this now that the only way out was through.</p><p>He thought he heard the word policia more than once from the onlookers and turned toward the crowd.</p><p>“No policia!” he said, waving his arms in a broad negative pantomime. “Por favor, no policia!”</p><p>That’s when Xochi appeared out of the crowd, shouting in Spanish and running to Dean.</p><p>“Is he...?” she asked.</p><p>“Alive,” Dean said. “Barely.”</p><p>Xochi picked up the discarded dart and sniffed at the tip, then bent down and sniffed at Sam’s slack, open lips.</p><p>“I think this is a sleep drug,” Xochi said. “This dart was probably meant for Claudia.”</p><p>“How can you be sure?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Because if it was traditional Nagual poison,” she said, “he would be having convulsions and there would be an acidic yellow foam around his mouth.”</p><p>“Where is Claudia?”</p><p>Xochi shook her head, expression grim.</p><p>“They’ve got her.”</p><p>Dean clenched his fist.</p><p>“Dead?”</p><p>“I hope not,” she said.</p><p>A burly young man with long, curly hair and a Cannibal Corpse T-shirt pulled up in a battered, primer black El Camino, honking and hollering for people to get out of his way. He leaned out the driver’s window and called out to Dean, motioning at the open truck bed.</p><p>“Come on,” Xochi said, grabbing Sam’s ankles. “Let’s get him into the back.”</p><p>Dean grabbed Sam under the arms and the two of them lifted him into the bed of the El Camino. Dean climbed in back with Sam and Xochi got up front. The driver pulled out into traffic before Xochi could close the passenger door. There was no tailgate, so Dean had to hang on to Sam with one arm and wrap a hank of knotted rope around the other to anchor himself to the body of the truck so the two of them didn’t slide out the back every time the driver hit the gas.</p><p>The El Camino took them down into the twisted, cobbled streets of Guanajuato. There didn’t seem to be any logic at all to the haphazard intersections, winding alleys, and damp, dripping tunnels. If there were any traffic lights or signs, they were more like casual suggestions that everyone ignored. Getting from one place to the other in this town seemed to be more like improvisational theater than actual driving. It was really a beautiful little town, full of gorgeous buildings, churches and theaters, but Dean was watching Sam, willing him to wake up.</p><p>The driver pulled up in front a little row of shops, none of which looked open. Xochi got out and came around back to give Dean a hand with Sam. Once they got him down out of the truck bed, Xochi called out to the driver and waved. The driver stuck an arm out the window in salute and then drove away.</p><p>“Who was that?” Dean asked, adjusting his grip on Sam.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Xochi said. “He said his name was Alejandro.”</p><p>“Why did he help us?” Dean asked, watching the El Camino drive away.</p><p>“He liked my ass.”</p><p>Dean laughed, adjusting Sam’s weight again.</p><p>“I won’t argue with that,” he said. “Where are we taking Sam?”</p><p>“Here,” she said, gesturing with her chin to an unmarked door.</p><p>She knocked on the door and it was answered by a person who looked to be in their early sixties. Dean couldn’t tell if they were a man or a woman. The features were rough and heavy, mannish and free of make-up, but the fluffy white hair was long, elaborately coiffed and curled. The clothes were plain, loose-fitting, and black, except for a bright purple, sparkly scarf with a beaded fringe. Jeweled rings on every thick finger but nails trimmed short and unpainted. Purple cowboy boots.</p><p>Xochi introduced herself and Dean. The person said their name was Lulo and exchanged a few Spanish words with Xochi, before motioning for them to enter. Lulo’s voice did nothing to clear up Dean’s confusion. It was low in pitch but distinctly feminine in tone.</p><p>They were led into a small cluttered room that looked like it had been decorated by the Native American Liberace in 1971. There was a full-sized mannequin suspended from the ceiling as if flying, dressed in an outfit that might have been selected by a drag-queen playing Pocahontas in a Las Vegas show. There were tons of kitschy tomahawks and feather headdresses and other “Indian” knickknacks, all embellished with various glittery, homemade touches. One whole corner was taken up with an elaborate altar covered in candles, incense, coins and small, greenish oranges. Above the altar was a painting of a shirtless guy with a coyote head and a red flute. Dean assumed it was an image of Huehuecoyotl. Lulo motioned for Dean to bring Sam over to a pink-velvet couch covered in thick, clear-plastic slipcovers.</p><p>Lulo looked Sam over, touching his wrists and forehead, smelling his breath and pushing his hair back from his face.</p><p>Dean wasn’t thrilled about the idea of this weird stranger messing with his brother, but he trusted Xochi. He didn’t want to and certainly hadn’t planned to, but he did. He had to. He looked over at her and she gave him a slight, reassuring nod.</p><p>Lulo said something to Xochi in Spanish and left the room.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “First of all, is that Lulo person a guy or a woman?”</p><p>“Lulo is a two-spirit shaman,” Xochi answered, as if that explained everything.</p><p>“I don’t get it.” Dean frowned. “I mean, everybody’s gotta be one or the other, right?”</p><p>“Lulo doesn’t.”</p><p>Dean had no idea what to make of that.</p><p>“Well,” Dean said, shrugging. “If I’m not gonna date her... him... whatever, then I guess it doesn’t matter to me. All that matters right now is whether or not this person can help Sam.”</p><p>“Sam will be okay without help,” Xochi said. “Lulo confirmed that he is only sleeping. But we can’t do anything if we have to carry him around like this. We need him awake and able to help us, so Lulo has agreed to mix up a tonic to reverse the effect of the drug.”</p><p>“And what about Claudia? We gotta find her.”</p><p>“My guess is that the Nagual have drugged her like they drugged Sam. They will want to keep her hidden until she wakes. Once that happens, they will question her.”</p><p>“Question her,” Dean echoed. He knew exactly what that meant.</p><p>“They will make her tell them where Elvia is. Then they will kill her.”</p><p>“Any idea where they might have taken her?” Dean asked.</p><p>Xochi shook her head. “But you know who will know where she is?”</p><p>“Who? Lulo?”</p><p>“Elvia.”</p><p>Lulo returned with a small pink cordial glass filled with dark liquid, motioning to Dean to lift Sam’s head. Dean put his arm around his brother and cupped the back of his head. Lulo held the glass to Sam’s lips. Some of the murky tonic dribbled down Sam’s chin, but the rest went down his throat. Sam’s reaction was immediate and violent, as if he’d received an adrenalin shot to the heart.</p><p>He sat bolt upright, gasping, eyes flashing wide and white around the edges like a frightened horse. He knocked the glass out of Lulo’s hand and might have actually taken a swing at the shaman if Dean hadn’t been right there to grab his brother’s arm.</p><p>“Hey, whoa,” Dean said. “Take it easy, Sammy.”</p><p>“What the hell happened?” Sam asked. He looked around the room. “Where’s Claudia?”</p><p>Dean filled him in while Lulo gathered up the broken pink glass off the sparkly linoleum.</p><p>“All right then,” Sam said. “We’d better go find Elvia.”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Dean said. “You really think she’s gonna listen to us after we tried to kill her?”</p><p>“If you’ve got a better idea, I’d love to hear it,” Sam said.</p><p>“If you convinced the Alpha to help us,” Xochi said, “you can convince Elvia.”</p><p>“How did this hunt become all about me sweet-talking chick monsters?” Dean asked.</p><p>“It’s only because you are so good at it,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Yeah, but the Alpha was...” Dean struggled for the right way to say this. “Well not exactly normal, but normal for what she is. Elvia, not so much. She’s obviously been driven dangerously insane by everything she went through. I don’t think she can be reasoned with.”</p><p>“Come on, Dean,” Sam said. “You’ve had plenty of crazy broads in your life. Remember Niki Drummond?”</p><p>“You mean the facehugger?” Dean shuddered. “How could I forget? I thought I was gonna have to chew my own leg off to get away from her.”</p><p>“You can do this, Dean,” Xochi said.</p><p>“But I don’t think Elvia even understands English,” Dean said.</p><p>“I will translate,” Xochi said. “We are wasting valuable time with this argument. Whatever we are going to do, we need to do it now. Right away.”</p><p>“She’s right,” Sam said, getting to his feet. He pulled out that huge Magnum and checked it over. “Did you get the ammo?”</p><p>Dean nodded, hefted the bag.</p><p>“Okay then,” Sam said. “Are we doing this or are we doing this?”</p><p>Lulo came over to Sam and took his hand, saying something Dean didn’t understand.</p><p>“Lulo wants to bless you,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Bless me?” Sam frowned.</p><p>“Lulo says that you also have two spirits,” Xochi said, translating as Lulo spoke. “Not male and female, but good and evil, intertwined like connected twins who can never be separated. All your life, gods, demons, and men have been trying to push you one way or the other. But Lulo wants you to know that you will always have these two spirits inside you. That you must learn to accept and embrace that duality and find your own balance between the two. To be your own man, on your own terms. Lulo wants to bless your... your vessel while it is empty, so that when your twin spirits are freed from their imprisonment, the wounded halves will... integrate together more harmoniously.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam and could see that his brother wasn’t buying any of this mumbo-jumbo. Twin spirits or not, Dean wondered if Sam was still just as dead set against getting his soul back as he was the last time they’d talked about it. They’d been way too busy to get into it again and Dean certainly wasn’t gonna be the one to bring it up, but he wondered. And although Dean wasn’t really sure if he was buying this mumbo-jumbo either, he did find it interesting that Lulo had said when Sam’s soul is freed, not if.</p><p>“Fine,” Sam said. “Whatever. Just make it quick.”</p><p>Lulo put a hand in the center of Sam’s chest, eyes closed and humming softly. Sam shot a glance toward Dean but said nothing. After about a minute, Lulo stepped back and nodded, big smile revealing two missing teeth, one on top and one on the bottom. Lulo then handed Sam a black-and-white-striped candle in a glass tube and said something in Spanish.</p><p>“Rub this candle on your hair, your face and your body,” Xochi said.</p><p>Sam looked skeptical but did as requested. Lulo took the candle, lit it and added it to the others cluttering up the glittery altar.</p><p>“Can we go now?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “We can go now.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-43">CHAPTER 43</span><a href="#chapter-43" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>El Museo De Las Momias was still closed when they got there. Which was a good thing. The last thing Dean wanted to deal with was crowds of sunburned tourists if Elvia decided to go on another rampage.</p><p>It was an old colonial building, tan and brown with rows of columns and archways along the front. The place was locked up tight as a drum, all heavy bars and steel gates. No windows and only one other side door—some kind of emergency exit around the corner from the main entrance. The alarm was a pushover, but the lock was a bitch, a Medeco 80 series MVP cam lock. Not totally pick-proof, but a real pain in the ass. Dean sent Sam to watch out for guards while he disabled the alarm, got out his picks, and went to work on the lock.</p><p>Dean had always thought of locks like women, and he liked a challenge. He shut out everything else around him and zeroed his focus down to the smallest micro-movements of his fingertips. Didn’t think about Claudia, or Sam, or the Star Demons. He just concentrated on the feel of the picks against the tumbler. He almost had it. Almost had it—</p><p>Then the door opened from the inside, startling Dean and making him step back and drop the picks, hand going reflexively to the shotgun grip. Xochi stuck her head out of the doorway, looked around, and waved Sam and Dean inside.</p><p>Sam smiled and held out his hand for Dean to go first. Dean gathered up his picks and ducked into the dark, stuffy interior of the silent museum.</p><p>“How the hell did you get in?” Dean asked Xochi.</p><p>Xochi gestured toward a young, chubby guard lurking in a distant doorway looking pink faced and smitten.</p><p>“You’re not the only one who knows how to sweet talk the opposite sex,” she said.</p><p>She blew the guard a kiss and winked. He looked down, turning even redder. Dean grinned.</p><p>“Okay,” Sam said. “So how are we going to find Elvia?”</p><p>“I think I have an idea of where she might be,” Xochi said.</p><p>She clicked on her mini-Maglite and led them down a long dark hallway and into an exhibition hall lined with glass cases. Dean followed with his own flashlight and Sam took the rear. Playing his light over the glass cases, Dean knew what he would be seeing, but knowing and seeing are two different things.</p><p>The cases were filled with corpses. Dozens and dozens of desiccated dead bodies. Delicate, papery, and dry, with yawning mouths and empty eye sockets. Many still had hair. Some had ragged clothes. Most were naked. Some were laid out flat, others propped up with wire as if standing on their withered, curled up feet.</p><p>“What’s with these all corpses anyway?” Sam asked.</p><p>“They are natural mummies,” Xochi said. “Dried up because of certain minerals in the soil. Around the late 1800s, a burial tax was created and if families could not pay for their loved ones, the bodies would be dug up and kicked out of the graveyard. But nobody wanted to just throw the bodies away with the garbage, so they piled them up in storage. This practice was outlawed in the fifties, but soon tourists started coming to see the collection of mummies. That’s why they opened this museum.”</p><p>“Wow,” Dean said, shining his light on the box-kite ribcage and shriveled breasts of a mummy with long wispy hair bound into a braid. “Fun for the whole family.”</p><p>Truth was, Dean knew that while Lisa would probably be less than thrilled, Ben would love something like this. Dean needed to push thoughts like that right out of his mind and stay focused.</p><p>“So where do you think Elvia is hiding?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Well,” Xochi said. “If I was a confused, crazy mama who lost her baby daughter, I think I would want to be with the angelitos.”</p><p>“The what?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Little angels?” Sam said, with a questioning tone.</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said, pointing at a doorway down at the far end of another long hallway. “The little angels.”</p><p>Dean raised his light to a sign reading “LOS ANGELITOS” and under that in English “The world’s smallest mummy!”</p><p>The angelitos were dead babies. Everything from larger toddlers to the “world’s smallest,” an unborn fetus that had been inexplicably been removed from its dead mother and displayed separately. Many were dressed up in fancy outfits and laid out on lacy pillows. Some had little plaques explaining who they were and others were unlabeled, mysterious and unknowable.</p><p>Xochi froze and put her hand on Dean’s chest, holding him back and pressing a finger to her lips. That’s when Dean heard it too. A soft, keening sound, like a hurt and lonely dog. One of the cases at the far end of the room was open.</p><h2><span id="chapter-44">CHAPTER 44</span><a href="#chapter-44" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>They’d been forced to leave the obsidian weapons back in Nogales, Arizona, and even though Dean knew he was supposed to be trying to talk to her, not kill her, he still hated going into a situation like this without a suitable weapon in hand.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, gesturing to the open case.</p><p>The old-fashioned wooden cases were raised up off the tiled floor on six-inch-high legs, leaving a gap beneath. A long gray hand was reaching slowly out from the shadows underneath the cases. Dean could feel that same weird static charge he felt at Claudia’s house racing across the surface of his skin.</p><p>“Elvia?” he said.</p><p>He crouched down slowly, tilting his head to peer underneath the cases. The Borderwalker was crammed into the narrow space, clutching a mummified baby in a dusty christening dress. Her form was human but abnormally thin and covered in patchy gray hair. Her black-hole eyes bored into Dean, black lips dripping venom and twitching into a snarl. She was breathing too fast, almost panting.</p><p>“Elvia, we’re not going to hurt you,” Dean said, looking back over his shoulder at Xochi.</p><p>Xochi repeated his words in Spanish.</p><p>She growled, low and harsh, nails clawing at the tile.</p><p>“Your daughter’s in danger,” Dean said. “She needs our help.”</p><p>Again, Xochi translated.</p><p>“Where is she?” Dean asked. “Where is Claudia?”</p><p>Xochi got down on one knee beside him and repeated his words.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>“We should cure her now,” Sam said. “Cure her, or kill her.”</p><p>“What?” Dean said. He kept his eyes on Elvia.</p><p>“Now, while we have the chance,” Sam said. “We may not get another shot.”</p><p>“If we cure her now,” Xochi said. “She will be an ordinary human again. Her bond with Claudia will be severed. Same if we kill her. Without that psychic connection, we won’t find Claudia. Once the Nagual know the connection has been severed, there will be no reason for them to keep Claudia alive.”</p><p>“Look, I’m sorry about that, but...”</p><p>“No, Sam,” Dean said. “No way. I already see where you’re going with this, and you’re overruled.”</p><p>“Overruled?” Sam took a step closer to Dean. “We can’t put the life of one girl before the millions of lives that will be lost if the Clawed Butterfly makes it into our world. Including our own. That’s just crazy. Suicidal.”</p><p>Elvia retreated further under the cases, shivering.</p><p>“You’re scaring her,” Xochi said.</p><p>“Back off, Sam,” Dean said. “Just let me talk to her, will ya? I’ll try to get her to accept the cure after I find out where Claudia is. But it’s Claudia first. I said I was gonna do everything in my power to protect that kid, and that’s exactly what I’m gonna do. You just watch the door and make sure I don’t get c-blocked by Teo and those crow-guys.”</p><p>Dean moved closer to the case, easing himself down onto his belly. Xochi was right beside him.</p><p>“Elvia, listen to me,” Dean said. “I know you’re scared, but your daughter is scared too. You can feel it can’t you? How scared she is?”</p><p>He waited for Xochi to translate, studying Elvia’s shifting face and hollow eyes. She was staring intently at Dean, frozen and tense as a cornered animal.</p><p>“She needs her mother,” Dean said. “She needs our help just like you do. Tell us where she is and we’re gonna get the both of you out of here, okay? I’m not gonna let Teo hurt you anymore.”</p><p>Those bony gray fingers slid back out and gripped Dean’s hand. It was hard not to flinch from her feverish touch, but he managed.</p><p>“Where is she?” he asked again.</p><p>Her answer came as a brutal blast of raw agony inside Dean’s head, accompanied by a powerful sense memory of shoving baby Claudia into a clump of dry brush and a rush of something that wasn’t really words, more like a primitive torrent of emotion.</p><p>“...leftherleftherleftherlefther...”</p><p>Dean touched his nose, fingers coming away wet with blood. Elvia’s anguished shriek was echoing inside his head like the worst migraine of all time.</p><p>“You had to leave her to protect her,” Dean said, struggling to keep his thoughts straight. “But now you have a chance to find her again. Find her and save her, Elvia. Tell me where she is.”</p><p>Elvia let go of Dean’s hand and came crawling out from under the cases. No one else moved. Sam’s hand was on the grip of the Magnum, eyes narrow, watching.</p><p>“Easy now,” Dean said.</p><p>Elvia dropped the mummified baby, shifting as she crawled. More coyote-like now but hunched and mangy, scabrous skin alive with insects. She was moving away from Dean, toward the doorway of the exhibit hall.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Dean asked.</p><p>Xochi translated. Elvia ignored them.</p><p>“Elvia?” Dean said, getting slowly to his feet. “Elvia, where is your daughter? Where is she?” Xochi’s rapid Spanish followed his words.</p><p>He could see the muscles in her scrawny haunches bunching up, ready to run. He was afraid he was losing her.</p><p>“Elvia, wait, listen to me—“ he began. But he was cut off by her answer, echoing inside his skull like the whine of a damaged buzz saw.</p><p>“...here...”</p><p>He caught a flickering image of Claudia, flanked by Nagual and standing in front of a row of female mummies.</p><p>Elvia leapt, tearing down the hallway.</p><p>Dean swore and took off after her, calling back over his shoulder.</p><p>“She’s here. Claudia’s here, in the museum.”</p><p>Dean followed Elvia down the hall and into a larger room with three doors, the one they came in through, one to the left, and one to the right. Xochi and Sam were close on his heels.</p><p>The chubby young guard who’d let Xochi in to the museum was dead, face down in a pool of blood.</p><p>There was a soft, rustling sound like the whisper of turning pages or the swish of a woman’s skirt. The sound was building and growing in volume. Then a massive, ear-shattering crash as every single glass case in the building shattered simultaneously. Dean grabbed Xochi and hit the tile, covering her with his body, his arms thrown across his face to protect against the spray of jagged glass.</p><p>“Sam!” Dean called, raising his head and spotting Sam in the left-hand doorway. “You okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” Sam said, pulling a shard of glass from his right shoulder. “But we got a problem.”</p><p>That was an understatement.</p><p>The mummies were climbing out of their cases.</p><h2><span id="chapter-45">CHAPTER 45</span><a href="#chapter-45" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Awesome,” Dean said, shaking broken glass out of his hair and pulling out the sawed-off shotgun. “This is just what we need.”</p><p>The mummies were surprisingly fast, their movements jerky and puppet-like. Dean let one have it with the shottie, blasting its desiccated head into dust. It kept coming, reaching for him with shaky, skeletal arms. Dozens more were pouring in through all three doorways, separating him from Sam and pushing his brother backwards out the left-hand door.</p><p>“You gotta be kidding,” Dean said, kicking and swinging, knocking the brittle mummies back—but they just kept coming. “Come on. What the hell is going on here, Xochi?”</p><p>“No,” Xochi cried, getting up on her knees. “No! Elvia!”</p><p>She held her hand out toward the Borderwalker, but the mummies were all over Xochi. They didn’t seem to be biting or even really attacking, just crowding her and pushing her back, away from Elvia. Xochi was using her telekinetic spell to smash through the crowd of mummies but they were an unstoppable tide.</p><p>Dean risked a look toward Elvia and saw her struggling, enveloped in glowing blue strands just like the ones Teo had used to bind her at Claudia’s house.</p><p>Xochi screamed something in Spanish. The only word Dean recognized was her sister’s name: Teo.</p><p>A pair of Nagual, one male and one female came in through the right-hand door, animal forms shifting to human as they reached out to grab the bound Borderwalker. Dean took a shot at the man, but several bumbling mummies got in the way, taking the force of the slug and pushing the barrel up toward the ceiling. The Nagual and Elvia were gone before Dean could reload.</p><p>Xochi had torn a two-foot long piece of wood from one of the shattered cases and was busting mummy heads left and right. Dean followed her lead, breaking off a heavy chunk of wood for himself. It seemed like blunt-force trauma was the way to go with these things. They didn’t stop coming until they were smashed to pieces.</p><p>“What’s with these mummies?” Dean asked. “Why can’t we kill them?”</p><p>“They are not real,” Xochi replied.</p><p>“They seem pretty real to me,” Dean said, swinging the chunk of wood and caving in a leathery ribcage.</p><p>“I mean they are not autonomous,” Xochi explained, taking the twiggy legs out from under a half-dressed female mummy. “They have been animated by Teo to slow us down and block us.”</p><p>“Damn, that bitch is good,” Dean said.</p><p>Dean heard the distinctive baritone bark of Sam’s Magnum, twice, then three times, in the chamber to their left.</p><p>“Come on,” Dean said, heading for the left-hand door.</p><p>Xochi followed him.</p><p>“Here,” Xochi said, putting her shoulder against one of the larger cases right by the door. “Help me.”</p><p>Dean put his weight against the case.</p><p>“One, two...” Xochi counted.</p><p>Together they shoved the case over, blocking the mummies from the large room from entering the hallway. There were still plenty of stragglers in the hallway, but it looked like Sam had really cut a swath through the ones on this side of the door. The floor was littered with dry bones and rags and flaps of parchment skin.</p><p>Dean dodged the remaining mummies and ducked through another doorway. There, in a long narrow gallery, was Sam, facing off against a single Nagual woman. Several of her fellow shifters lay dead around her. She had her arm around a pale and wide-eyed Claudia, stone knife pressed against her throat, using the girl’s body as a shield.</p><p>Dean raised both his hands, letting the wood drop to the floor.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “Take it easy. Don’t hurt her.”</p><p>Sam was totally calm and still, expression neutral. The Nagual hissed something Dean couldn’t understand. Sam raised the Magnum, exhaled slowly and shot the Nagual between the eyes.</p><p>The Nagual went down in shower of sparks. Claudia ran to Dean, while Sam stepped up to the fallen shifter and gave her a precautionary double tap in what remained of her head.</p><p>“You okay, kid?” Dean asked, lifting Claudia’s chin and eyeing the trickle of blood where the Nagual knife had bit into her skin.</p><p>“I knew you’d save me,” she said, squeezing Dean’s waist so tight he could barely breathe.</p><p>“Yeah, well how about a little sugar for Sam?” Dean asked. “He’s the one who saved you, not me.”</p><p>Sam was reloading the Magnum, not paying any attention to either one of them. Claudia let go of Dean and went over to hug Sam.</p><p>“Thanks, Sam,” she said.</p><p>Sam looked over the top of her head at Dean, eyebrows knitting.</p><p>“Say ‘you’re welcome,’ Dexter,” Dean said.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Sam said. “Now let’s get the hell out of here and figure out how to get Elvia back.”</p><p>“I heard Xochi’s sister saying they needed to get to Mexico City,” Claudia said. “But she didn’t say exactly where.”</p><p>“Then we’d better get on the road.”</p><p>Xochi boosted the only vehicle in the museum parking lot, a bondo-ed pick-up truck covered in religious stickers. Claudia rode up front while Sam and Dean climbed into the bed. The ride was slow and bumpy, constantly thwarted by crazy traffic, and for a good hour, Sam and Dean didn’t speak.</p><p>“Why did you save Claudia?” Dean finally asked.</p><p>Sam didn’t answer for a minute, just squinted against the sun.</p><p>“Why not?” Sam said. “We still need her, don’t we?”</p><p>“Yeah, but you didn’t know that at the time,” Dean said. “For all you knew, Elvia could have been dead at that point.”</p><p>“I saw that I had a shot. I took it.” Sam shrugged. “Couldn’t really think of any reason not to.”</p><p>Dean knew it was impossible, just wishful thinking really, but he found himself wanting to believe that maybe there was some tiny scrap of conscience left in Sam after all. Some little echo inside his head that kept him from taking the easy shot, through Claudia’s chest and into the shifter behind her.</p><p>A few minutes later, the truck coughed, spluttered and died. Xochi was able to coast over onto the shoulder to get them out of traffic.</p><p>Dean and Sam got out of the back while Xochi leaned out the driver’s side window.</p><p>“This truck has no third gear,” she said.</p><p>“Lovely,” Dean said. “Pop the hood.”</p><p>He raised the hood, releasing a ton of toxic smoke as he propped it open and peered inside.</p><p>“Who knew that you could make a whole engine out of duct tape?” Dean said, waving a hand in front of his face to clear the smoke. He shook his head and closed the hood like it was a coffin lid. “This thing isn’t going anywhere.”</p><p>Xochi got out and fished around in her pockets.</p><p>“Let me call Alejandro,” she said, unfolding a crumpled bar napkin.</p><p>“Who?” Dean asked.</p><p>“The guy with the El Camino,” Xochi said, pulling out her phone and dialing the number off the napkin.</p><p>“He gave you his phone number?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Of course,” she replied.</p><p>She switched to Spanish and turned away from Dean, voice taking on a flirtatious tone.</p><p>Dean looked down at his hands. The backs of his hands and forearms were scratched up from the broken glass. Nothing serious.</p><p>Xochi ended the call.</p><p>“Alejandro is at work right now,” she said. “But he’s sending his cousin Oscar. He can give us a ride to Santiago de Querétaro. We can get another car there, or, if we find no other choice, we can take the bus into El D.F.”</p><p>“The bus?” Claudia made a sour face. “I’m not taking the bus. Aren’t Mexican busses, like, full of chickens and babies with TB and ten smelly guys mashed up against you?”</p><p>“You’ve been watching too many American movies,” Xochi said. “The bus is just a bus. Just normal people, going to work or to visit relatives. No chickens allowed.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam said. “But we don’t have time to wait for a bus. We’re bleeding time here. Every lost minute is an extra mile Teo has on us. At this rate, there’s no way we are gonna make it in time to stop her. We still don’t have any idea exactly where she’s going. Now I’ve never been to Mexico City, but I understand it’s pretty big. “</p><p>“You’re right,” Xochi said. She paused a moment in thought. “Claudia, have you ever tried consciously to link minds with your mother?”</p><p>Claudia shook her head.</p><p>“It just kinda happens,” she said.</p><p>“I will teach you,” Xochi said. “Once we get on the road. This may be our only chance.”</p><p>They waited for over an hour in the dusty swelter before a guy pulled up in a ridiculously tricked-out white mid-eighties Monte Carlo SS. He looked about twelve years old, but with way too much hard living around the eyes. Dressed in a shiny, sharkskin suit and a screamingly loud fuchsia-silk dress shirt. He was so short, Dean was surprised he was able to drive without sitting on a phone book. This guy had to be Oscar.</p><p>Xochi greeting him in Spanish and made introductions. Dean just nodded and smiled. Xochi sat up front while Dean and Sam had to cram themselves into the back seat with Claudia between them.</p><p>As they crept through the snarled and snail-like traffic, the prepaid phone Xochi had given Dean back in Nogales rang in Sam’s pocket.</p><p>Sam took out the phone, glanced at the screen. He took the call.</p><p>“Bobby?” he said. “What have you got?”</p><p>Sam listened in silence for several minutes.</p><p>“Right,” Sam said. “Okay.”</p><p>He ended the call.</p><p>“What did he say?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam kept his voice low, even though it seemed pretty clear that Alejandro’s cousin didn’t speak English.</p><p>“Not much on the possibility of curing Elvia using the Alpha’s blood,” Sam said. “He says he can’t find any info whatsoever on the Borderwalkers, only the most vague allegorical references to the Coyote’s Kiss in some old recordings of Native American oral history. We’re on our own there. But he had some interesting things to say about the Star Demons.”</p><p>“Great, let’s hear it,” Dean said.</p><p>“Those soul-chewing teeth,” Sam said. “They’re a weakness as well as a strength. Probably the Star Demon’s only weakness.”</p><p>“How?” Dean asked. “I don’t get it.”</p><p>“The teeth are made of obsidian. Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring volcanic glass, razor sharp but also brittle and easy to shatter. A couple of good cracks in the mouth with a blunt weapon would essentially defang the demon. The only problem would be getting cut by the flying shards.”</p><p>“Not to mention getting close enough to score a hit like that,” Dean said.</p><p>“Right now,” Sam said. “That’s pretty much all we’ve got.”</p><p>The ride to Santiago de Querétaro was agonizingly slow. Xochi tried to make polite conversation with Oscar, but she could feel every passing second cranking the tension inside her higher and higher.</p><p>Once they finally got into town, Oscar dropped them off in front of the bus station. Unfortunately, massive lines snaking out the main door made it clear that the bus wasn’t going to be an option.</p><p>Dean managed to boost a halfway-decent Caddy El Dorado that didn’t look like it would fall apart on them, but getting the car out of the city was a whole other challenge. Xochi could tell that dealing with improvisational Mexican driving was making Dean homicidal. He was leaning out the open window, shouting hilariously creative American profanities and shaking his fist at the motorbikes and taxicabs, but there was nothing she could do about that now. She needed to be in the back seat with Claudia.</p><p>“Now I want you to listen very carefully to me,” Xochi told the girl. “What I am teaching you is not easy. Normally you would need to learn how to link with someone who is right next to you before you would be able to link with people who are far away, but we have no time. You must learn to run before walking, but your natural ability and your bond with your mother are both so strong that I believe you can do it.”</p><p>“I hope you’re right,” Claudia said.</p><p>“First you must clear your mind,” Xochi said. “I know this is hard with so much happening, but it is a critical step. Imagine that you are a glass pitcher and all your thoughts and worries are pouring out of you like water, until you are empty.”</p><p>Claudia took Xochi’s hand and closed her eyes.</p><p>“Slow your breathing,” Xochi said. “Shut out all the noise around us.”</p><p>Claudia did as she was told.</p><p>“Now,” Xochi said. “Say these words after me.”</p><p>Xochi slowly spoke the ancient words of the mind-linking spell, carefully and clearly enunciating the complicated string of syllables. Claudia stumbled on some of the pronunciation, and Xochi had to struggle to keep her own mind calm and breath even.</p><p>“Start again,” Xochi said.</p><p>She spoke the spell again, even more slowly this time. Claudia followed along, but before she could finish she sucked in a sharp gasp, clutching Xochi’s hand tight.</p><p>“I see her,” Claudia said.</p><p>“What do you see?” Xochi asked.</p><p>“A huge swap meet,” Claudia said. “With all these different color tarps. Hundreds of stalls selling all kinds of weird, cheap stuff. I see the Nagual taking Elvia into an empty storefront. A green building.”</p><p>“Show me,” Xochi said, pressing her hand to Claudia’s forehead.</p><p>A stream of images flooded Xochi’s mind. She recognized the place at once.</p><p>“Tepito,” Xochi said. “El Barrio Bravo. This is a rough neighborhood in the Cuauhtémoc section of Mexico City.”</p><p>Claudia’s eyes opened, looking into Xochi’s with a kind of stunned wonder.</p><p>“I did it,” she said.</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “You did.”</p><p>“Tell me about the area,” Sam said. “How rough are we talking here?”</p><p>“We will have dangers there,” Xochi said. “Human and inhuman. But I know the area well. It is full of good people as well as bad. Many of my closest friends are Tepiteños.”</p><p>“Okay then,” Dean said to Xochi. “Now that we got that cleared up, I think it’s time for you to drive, before I add a dozen counts of intentional vehicular homicide to my rap sheet.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-46">CHAPTER 46</span><a href="#chapter-46" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>They made Mexico City by sundown. The area of Tepito was easy to find. The flapping, colorful blue-and-yellow tarps were just like Claudia had described them. Tall wire racks of merchandise. Knock-off perfumes. Fake designer watches and purses. Pirated DVDs. Piles of second-hand clothing and small appliances. Paper flowers and cheap nylon panties. Dean had never seen anything quite like it.</p><p>Xochi parked the stolen El Dorado on a side street. They all got out of the car, gathering and checking their weapons, but Xochi seemed distracted, staring up into the night sky. She turned to Dean with real fear in her eyes.</p><p>“Dean,” she said. “The Tianquiztli cluster, can you see it?”</p><p>“The what?”</p><p>“That’s a constellation.” Sam said. “The Pleiades, right?”</p><p>“You call it ‘the seven sisters,’” Xochi said. “We call it ‘the marketplace.’”</p><p>“I don’t see it,” Sam said. “Maybe it’s just too smoggy. Or the bright city lights are hiding it.”</p><p>“Can’t you feel that breeze?” Xochi said. “The night is clear. All the other neighboring stars are clear. This is a terrible omen.”</p><p>“What kind of omen?” Dean asked. “What does it mean?”</p><p>“It means the end of the world,” she said. “It means demons will devour the earth. It means the Tzitzimimeh are coming.”</p><p>“Are coming?” Sam asked. “Or are here already?”</p><p>“Don’t you see?” Xochi said. “It’s all connected. This place, Tepito, it is the ancient second marketplace. In the time of my Aztec ancestors, this place was a ghetto market for disreputable, lower-class merchants who were not allowed in the main marketplace. Stolen goods have been sold here for hundreds of years. It is now and has always been a place of much illegal activity, and it is the perfect place for Teo and Itzapapalotl to conduct their illicit business. Now the celestial marketplace is gone from the sky. It has already begun. The Star Demons are on their way, if they are not here already.”</p><p>“What’s that music?” Claudia asked.</p><p>“Sounds like mariachis,” Xochi said.</p><p>They turned the corner and found the street choked with people. There was some kind of parade or street fair in progress. Every tenth person seemed to be holding a large doll, each one wearing a different frilly, elaborate outfit. It took Dean a second to realize that all the dolls had skull faces.</p><p>“What is this?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No,” Xochi said, her voice full of dread. “No, this is terrible. We need to get these poor people out of here!”</p><p>“It’s a Santa Muerte festival, isn’t it?” Claudia asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said. “And all these people will be meeting the Skinny Lady much sooner than they expect if they stay here tonight.”</p><p>“Saint Death?” Sam asked. “They worship Death?”</p><p>“They think they are Catholics,” Xochi explained. “But really they are worshiping the Aztec death goddess Mictecacihuatl. Death is neither good or evil. She comes for all of us. We are all equal to her.”</p><p>“My Tia, Izzy, has an altar to Santa Muerte in her backyard,” Claudia said. “She put it up after her son got shot. My mom always said she was nuts.” Claudia looked down at her hands. “I mean, my adopted mom...”</p><p>“Come on,” Dean said. “We need to find Elvia.”</p><p>There was a group of Aztec dancers in full traditional dress gathering up their drums and equipment at the edge of the crowd. A man in a huge, elaborate skull and feather headdress spotted Xochi and raised a hand.</p><p>“Javi!” she called to him.</p><p>He came running over to where they stood and swept Xochi up in his arms, lifting her off her booted feet and laughing. He was broad-chested and ripped within an inch of his life, wearing nothing but an elaborately embroidered loin cloth. She spoke to him in Spanish, kissing him on the mouth and getting his black-and-white skull make-up on her lips. He set her down, cupping her the curve of her ass with one hand and speaking close to her ear in a low, intimate tone.</p><p>“This is my friend Javi,” Xochi said. “Dean, Sam, and Claudia.”</p><p>Dean nodded in silent greeting, biting back on an involuntary and ridiculously powerful surge of competitive, testosterone-fueled dislike for the buff dancer.</p><p>Xochi spoke to Javi in rapid-fire Spanish, pointing down the street. Javi nodded and took off in that direction.</p><p>“Wow,” Claudia said. “Is that your boyfriend?”</p><p>“Sometimes,” Xochi replied.</p><p>“If that was my boyfriend,” Claudia said, staring after Javi, “it would definitely be all the time. We’d never leave the house.”</p><p>Dean looked over at Sam, who was suppressing a smirk.</p><p>“Looks like you’re not the center of the female universe after all, dude,” Sam said.</p><p>“Come on,” Dean said. “I’d look good in a loincloth too, wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“I don’t ever want to know the answer to that question,” Sam replied.</p><p>Xochi came over to Dean.</p><p>“I told Javi to spread the word that one of the gangs is planning a drive-by,” she said. “If we’re lucky, that will get some of these people out of the street. Meanwhile, we need to start searching these storefronts to see if we can find the empty green one from Claudia’s vision. This is where Elvia will be opening the gate.”</p><p>There was a low rumble under their feet, like the subway or a passing truck. Xochi gripped Dean’s arm.</p><p>“They’re here,” Xochi said. “Can’t you feel it?”</p><p>“I don’t feel anything,” Sam said.</p><p>But Dean did. It was horrible, a pulsating, unnatural resonance that felt like a more subtle version of the work that Xochi’s grandmother had done on his wounded soul. The healing scar on his hand was throbbing like a second heart.</p><p>“Look!” Claudia said, pointing to a small skirmish going on about a half a block away. It resembled a chaotic bar fight, except more than half of the participants had large, gaping wounds on their arms and faces. Mortal wounds that didn’t seem to be slowing them down or affecting them in any way. The fight was swiftly spreading through the gathered celebrants. People were screaming and frantically trying to get away, but it was too crowded and there was nowhere for them to go.</p><p>Then, the plate-glass front of one of the shops exploded outwards and Dean got his first look at a Star Demon.</p><p>The creature was so big that it had to crouch down to fit through the shattered plate-glass storefront. The first thing Dean saw was long, black machete-clawed fingers clinging to the edges of the broken window. Then a massive head the size of a La-Z-Boy. Corpse-white skin, tiny matte-black eyes, and a wide, under-slung jaw like a lantern fish. Its crooked, obsidian teeth were slick with blood. In place of hair was a crown of gory, bone-white horns and glossy black quills. As it crawled free of the pale-green storefront, Dean could see its emaciated torso was distinctly female. A necklace of severed human hands and impossibly beating hearts swung between the grayish flaps of its crone-like breasts. Bloodshot human eyes studded the long white arms and legs, blinking and rolling as it stood to its full height of nine feet or more.</p><p>“Run!” Xochi said.</p><p>The four of them tore down the street with a riot on their heels. The soulless zombie victims were spreading through the crowd as swiftly as the mounting panic, and both ends of the street were blocked by competing taco trucks set up to serve the festival crowd.</p><p>“In here,” Sam said, pushing open the door to a small shoe store and waving them inside.</p><p>As soon they were through the door, Sam and Dean worked together to pull down the security gate while Xochi shoved Claudia behind a rack of high-heeled boots and drew her .45. Seconds later, the glass shattered and a dozen bloody, reaching arms were shoved through the spaces in the gate, rattling it on its hinges.</p><p>“Headshots?” Dean asked, raising the shotgun.</p><p>“Yes,” Xochi said, demonstrating by putting a bullet into the forehead of a screeching, middle-aged woman with a bad perm, wearing a sparkly red tube-top.</p><p>The moment the zombie fell, three more took her place.</p><p>“Come on,” Sam said, gesturing to an open door that revealed a flight of stairs on the other side.</p><p>Xochi sent Claudia up the steps first and Sam followed close behind.</p><p>“Go,” Dean said, letting an old guy in a Raiders cap have it with the shotgun.</p><p>The security gate was starting to give, peeling loose from its moorings in one corner. The zombies would be in the shop in under a minute.</p><p>Dean shot a skinny young man trying to push through the gap and then ran backwards toward the stairs, reloading as he went.</p><p>He got to the door just as the zombies busted through the gate. He slammed the door, shoved a large metal garbage can up under the doorknob, then followed Xochi up the stairs.</p><p>The second floor was just a bunch of empty offices so they continued up to the roof. The roof access door was reinforced steel, locked with a key lock. Another damn Medeco.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“On it,” Dean said, stepping up to the door and pulling out his lock picks.</p><p>His hands were shaking with adrenaline. He took in a long deep breath and struggled to focus, shutting out everything but the feel of the tumbler.</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said urgently. “They’re in the stairwell.”</p><p>“Come on, baby,” Dean whispered between clenched teeth. “Come on, come on, come on.”</p><p>Sam and Xochi were firing down the stairs, but Dean ignored it. Focusing.</p><p>The lock gave, and popped open.</p><p>Dean let out his breath in a shaky laugh and pushed the door open.</p><p>“Claudia!” he yelled, pushing the girl through the door and out onto the roof.</p><p>Sam followed Claudia and then Xochi. Dean was about to go through the door himself when he felt clutching hands grab the back of his shirt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-47">CHAPTER 47</span><a href="#chapter-47" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean twisted his body around to face Xochi’s friend Javi. His chin was slick with gore, skull make-up smeared and ruined. He’d lost the feathered headdress at some point and there were giant teeth-marks in his shaved scalp. He screamed, blood-webbed teeth snapping inches from Dean’s face. Dean fought to shove Javi back far enough to raise the sawed-off for a headshot but the dancer was incredibly strong. Several more zombies were barreling up the stairs behind Javi. Dean had only seconds before they would be on him.</p><p>Then, the crack of a gunshot inches from Dean’s ear and Javi’s forehead burst open with an explosion of brains and bone. Dean kicked the dancer back down the stairs and Xochi was at his side, pulling him through the door and slamming it in the faces of the oncoming zombies.</p><p>Xochi and Dean both pressed their backs against the door, expecting to need all of their weight to hold it shut. Amazingly, the lock Dean had picked re-engaged itself as soon as the door closed and after a few moments, the two of them cautiously stepped away.</p><p>Dean looked over at Xochi. Her face was stone, eyes cold and emotionless as she efficiently reloaded the .45.</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said.</p><p>Xochi nodded without meeting his gaze. He knew better than to say anything else, knowing that this was exactly the way he would react if he were in her shoes. Now was not the time for emotion. That would come later. If there was a later.</p><p>Sam and Claudia were both standing at the edge of the roof, looking across an alley at the neighboring building. Dean joined them, looking down at the balls-out chaos ruling the street below.</p><p>A second Tzitzimitl had crawled out of the empty green shop to join the first, cutting a swath through the terrified crowd. Zombies were everywhere, ganging up on the few remaining living people and dragging them down.</p><p>“Where the hell are the police?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Police do not come to this part of the Barrio Bravo,” Xochi replied. “We need to find a way across to the green store where Elvia has opened the gate.”</p><p>“It’s too far to jump,” Sam said. “But look...”</p><p>Dean looked at the roof of the building on the other side of the alley. There was a large wooden extension ladder lying near the fire door.</p><p>“If we could get that ladder,” Sam said. “We could climb across and from there the buildings are all connected. We could get down into the green shop from above and get to Elvia.”</p><p>“And how do you propose to do that?” Dean asked. “If we could reach that ladder, we wouldn’t need it.”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He didn’t have to.</p><p>“Oh, hell, no,” Dean said. “Don’t even think about it.”</p><p>“The zombies, they’re chasing souls, right?” Sam said. “So are the Star Demons. I don’t have mine, so wouldn’t they leave me alone?”</p><p>“We have no way of knowing that for sure,” Dean said. “What if you’re wrong?”</p><p>“What if I’m not?” Sam asked. “I can sneak past them and get into that other building, then lay the ladder across the gap for you guys.”</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said. “This is why I needed Sam for this hunt to be successful. It wasn’t clear until this moment, but I think this... this is his destiny.”</p><p>Could that be true? Could it be that Sam was sent back from Hell without his soul for a reason? Could this be the reason, to stop yet another apocalypse? A double-blind deep cover mission into a foreign land where Castiel and all of Heaven’s minions were not allowed to interfere? Maybe so and maybe not, but either way, Dean just wasn’t seeing any other option.</p><p>“Dammit, Sammy,” Dean said. “I hate this plan.”</p><p>Sam headed over to a rickety fire escape hanging off the side of their building.</p><p>“I got this,” Sam said.</p><p>Claudia ran to Sam and hugged him. He looked up at Dean and then put his arms briefly around the girl’s shaking shoulders, face still neutral and expressionless.</p><p>“Good luck, Sam,” Claudia said.</p><p>“I don’t need luck,” Sam replied.</p><p>He started climbing down the fire escape, toward the street.</p><p>Dean watched his brother descend toward the madness of the street with his fists clenched and his heart in his throat. This had to work. It just had to.</p><p>When Sam reached the second floor, the fire escape simply ended, the ladder meant to reach the ground level either missing or stolen. He had no choice but to jump down to the sidewalk, right into the thick of the zombies. Which meant there would be nowhere to run if the zombies did go after him.</p><p>Sam looked up at Dean, acknowledging him with the slightest nod—then jumped.</p><p>He landed hard, knocking over a pair of punk kids with brightly colored mohawks. A heartbeat passed, then another. No reaction from the zombies. They just looked right through Sam.</p><p>“Hot damn,” Dean said. “He made it.”</p><p>“Dean,” Xochi said softly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Can I have my hand back?”</p><p>Dean looked down and saw that he had one of Xochi’s gloved hands in a vice grip. He let her go and she opened and closed her fingers like they were sore.</p><p>“Sorry,” Dean said.</p><p>“Where is he going?” Claudia asked.</p><p>Dean looked back down at the street and saw Sam weaving through the crowd of zombies, walking right past the door to the neighboring building. He was headed straight for the pair of Tzitzimimeh.</p><p>“Is he crazy?” Xochi asked, as Sam picked up a broken-off, four-foot length of rusty rebar.</p><p>There was about a ten-foot clear area around the long, skinny legs of the demons, littered with skull-faced Santa Muerte dolls and mutilated corpses. Sam slowly approached the edge of the clearing. The two demons were turned in opposite directions, one chewing through the rag-doll body of a teenaged girl and the other tipping its massive, oversized head like it was listening to something only it could hear.</p><p>Sam took a cautious, sliding step closer, raising the rebar like a samurai sword. Neither demon seemed to notice him.</p><p>“They can’t see him,” Xochi said, astounded disbelief in her husky voice. “He is invisible to them.”</p><p>Sam lunged at the listening demon, swinging the rebar and shattering nearly half the obsidian teeth in its massive jaw.</p><p>The demon screamed and swiped at Sam with its knife-like claws, but Sam danced back and to the left, while the creature lunged right. It was fighting blind, swiping at nothing while Sam snuck up from behind for a second shot.</p><p>“He’s going for the teeth,” Dean said. “Just like Bobby said.”</p><p>“Without those teeth, it can still attack,” Xochi said. “But it can make no more zombies. It can eat no more souls.”</p><p>Sam struck again, knocking out the flailing demon’s remaining teeth then leaping back, out of the way. His arms and face were laced with bleeding cuts, but the cuts were only flesh wounds. He had no soul to eat.</p><p>The other demon attacked the now toothless one, the two of them crashing together into the side of a toy store. One of them kicked out at a parked minivan, sending it flying and crashing into the window of the empty green storefront they’d crawled out of.</p><p>Sam let the attacking demon have it in the back of the knees, buckling its lanky legs. It spun toward him, jaw snapping inches from Sam’s face as he faded back and then swung for the fences, obsidian teeth fragments flying everywhere.</p><p>The first demon lunged at the second, retaliating with wild, vicious swipes of its bloody claws. The two went down together, scattering cars and vendor’s tables.</p><p>Sam ran, dodging through hoards of milling, confused zombies and heading for the open door of the building opposite the one where Dean, Xochi and Claudia were trapped. He ducked inside, pulling the door closed behind him.</p><p>They waited. Just under five minutes later, Sam appeared on the neighboring roof, ladder in hand.</p><p>“What did I tell you?” Sam called. “Piece of cake.”</p><p>“I never thought I’d say this,” Dean said. “But after that stunt, I think you might almost be as bad ass as me.”</p><p>“Almost,” Sam said, laying the ladder across the gap. “Now get your bad ass over here will ya?”</p><p>“Claudia first,” Xochi said. “Sam, Dean: hold the ends of the ladder.</p><p>Claudia looked down at the zombies below. They had spotted the activity on the roof and were scrabbling at the walls, trying to climb over each other and reaching upward.</p><p>“Don’t look down,” Dean said.</p><p>Claudia started across, inching slowly along. She was a little less than halfway when she slipped and nearly fell, clinging desperately to the rungs, legs swinging.</p><p>“Come on!” Sam called. “Keep coming.”</p><p>“I can’t!” Claudia wailed, clinging tighter. Frozen with terror.</p><p>Xochi swore.</p><p>“Hold on,” she said. “I’m coming.”</p><p>Xochi made her way across the ladder, which started to bend beneath their combined weight.</p><p>“I’m slipping!” Claudia cried.</p><p>“You’re not slipping,” Xochi said. “You’re fine. Give me your hand.”</p><p>“I can’t!”</p><p>“Yes you can. Give me your hand.”</p><p>Claudia looked down at the reaching zombies, then squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p>“Don’t look down,” Dean said again.</p><p>Claudia reached a shaking hand toward Xochi and Xochi heaved her back to safety. Together, they made it across the rest of the ladder. Sam was there on the other roof to help Claudia down on the other side. Xochi joined them and then turned back and motioned to Dean.</p><p>Dean looked around for something to secure the ladder when he crossed. He weighed it down with a discarded clay plant pot and then began to cross. As he made his way across the splintery ladder, he could feel that the joints where the extensions met had been weakened by Claudia’s struggle. He was almost to the other side when the stressed joints gave way. Dean felt himself slipping, falling.</p><p>Sam caught the back of Dean’s shirt with one hand and his arm with the other, hoisting him awkwardly upward while the pieces of the ladder crashed down on the howling zombies. Dean could feel his shirt ripping. He didn’t look down, just locked his grip on Sam’s wrist.</p><p>Sam was as calm and stoic as always. No sweat. But even though he hadn’t seemed particularly worried that Dean might fall and end up zombie chum, he’d still grabbed Dean. He didn’t let Dean fall. Dean looked up into his brother’s cold eyes. Looking for something that he knew wasn’t there. Or was it?</p><p>Sam pulled him up.</p><p>“What are you?” Dean said to Sam as he climbed up onto the roof. “Captain Frickin’ America all of a sudden?”</p><p>“Yeah, whatever,” Sam said. “We have work to do.”</p><p>“You know,” Dean said, fighting to catch his breath. “For a guy with no soul who doesn’t give a damn about anyone, you’re turning out to be quite the hero.”</p><p>“Just trying to be practical,” Sam said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-48">CHAPTER 48</span><a href="#chapter-48" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Xochi stayed close to Claudia, trying not to think about Javi. He had been a good lover, even though he always wanted more emotionally than she was willing or able to give. She knew that the adrenalin pumping through her body was numbing that particular pain, though she knew that the second she slowed down, it would come back to knee her in the gut. But she couldn’t worry about that now. She had to stay focused on Claudia.</p><p>“Here,” Xochi said, tucking a single marigold behind Claudia’s ear. “You take the last one.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Claudia said.</p><p>Sam had played out his role as if he’d been born to do it, now it would be up to the girl to complete the puzzle and fulfill her own destiny. Whatever shape that destiny may take.</p><p>But was Xochi ready? Ready to face Teo? All this time, with everything that had happened, she was still deeply conflicted. She felt such poisonous anger toward her sister, but blood was blood. Teo was still the person who’d raised Xochi, who went without food so that Xochi and Atlix would have enough, who’d taught Xochi to read, to shoot, to hunt. Xochi had idolized her big sister for years, struggling to copy her hairstyles and her swagger and the way she held a gun. Then, after their brother’s death, Xochi spent the subsequent years distancing herself from Teo, trying to do everything she could to prove that she and her sister were nothing alike. But there was just no escaping the truth, that Xochi wouldn’t be the hunter she was today without the conflicted gravitational flux of her relationship with Teo. Was she really prepared to do whatever it took to stop Teo? Including killing her?</p><p>Crossing the connected roofs was no problem. Getting down through the building and into the empty shop was more of a challenge. It was crawling with zombies and Nagual but Sam and Dean were ahead of her, clearing the way for Claudia like a supernatural SWAT team.</p><p>As they came down the last flight of stairs, a violent tremor shook the building, sending them all staggering into one another and clutching at the handrails. One of the pursuing Nagual came tumbling down the stairs between them and Sam took her out the second she hit the bottom.</p><p>When they got to the first floor, they found that it was one big empty storefront. A painting project was half completed, with tarps, cans and brushes stacked against one wall. The crushed minivan was protruding sideways through the broken glass front. At the other end of the shop, where there should have been a back wall and maybe an emergency exit, was an open, pulsating gate, spiraling down into dizzy, sickening nothing. And front and center, Teo. Itztlitlantl in her hand.</p><p>“You’re too late,” Teo said in English. Then she switched to their ancient native language. “Elvia is bringing Itzpapalotl through the gate right now. The rest of her sisters are following close behind her. I can’t stop it now and neither can you. It’s over.”</p><p>“No,” Xochi said. “This is insane. Think about what you’re doing, Teo.”</p><p>“I have thought about it,” she said. “This isn’t the end of the world, little sister. It’s the beginning of a new era.”</p><p>Elvia crawled out of the gate, smoking from a dozen slashes, her stuttering form bleeding out into the air around her. Close behind her was a mammoth shape, coalescing out of the nothingness, all gleaming black teeth and howling hunger.</p><p>Claudia made a move toward her mother and Teo lunged at the girl with the obsidian knife. Sam and Dean both drew down on Teo, but Xochi was quicker, drawing her own stone knife, countering and knocking her sister back. They rolled together across the floor and away from Claudia.</p><p>“Don’t you touch her,” Xochi said in English, putting all her telekinetic power into her knife hand.</p><p>“Why fight me, Xochi?” Teo asked, countering with her own telekinetic power and forcing Xochi’s hand back. “This is our moment. The birth of an era of rampant monsters. An era in which skilled hunters like you and me will live like queens. The world will be a paradise of wild game and desperate humans willing to pay anything for our services. Even your little boyfriends will have more wealth and action than they will know what to do with.”</p><p>Claudia threw her arms around her mother. Elvia shifted again, pale and human now in her black hooded sweatshirt.</p><p>Dean watched Xochi and her sister fighting out of the corner of one eye, then took the flask from his back pocket.</p><p>“Elvia,” Dean said. “We can help you, but you need to drink this. I mean... breathe it. Dammit, just tell her, Claudia. We have to shut this gate right now.”</p><p>Claudia translated while Dean crouched down beside her and held out the flask to her mother. Elvia looked up at Dean for a minute, then reached out her hand.</p><p>Suddenly the whole building was rocking and rolling as a volley of tremors came out of the shimmering gate. Dean stumbled, battling to keep his balance on a floor that felt more like the deck of a ship in a thunderstorm. The flask slipped from his hand, spinning away toward the yawning gate.</p><p>Dean dove after it, but when it hit the cement floor, the cap popped off, and the Alpha’s fragrant blood wafted out and dissipated into the air.</p><p>Dean slammed his fist against the floor.</p><p>“Our mother would be ashamed if she could see you now,” Xochi said to Teo. “What you’ve become.”</p><p>“Don’t talk to me about shame,” Teo retorted. “You know nothing about our mother.”</p><p>Shuddering shockwaves came rolling out of the gate like a dozen simultaneous earthquakes. Cracks appeared in the walls and floor, spiderwebbing outward from the gate as the form inside became more solid, an enormous toothy head and long reaching arms now visible.</p><p>“I know she died a warrior’s death,” Xochi said. “She died performing her sacred duty.”</p><p>“I only let you believe she died an honorable death because you were so young and heartbroken,” Teo responded. “And because I didn’t want you to share the shame that I still live with to this day. The shame that made it impossible for me to keep on buying into the family’s pretentious posturing about ‘balance’ and ‘sacred duty.’”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Xochi asked. Though she wasn’t sure she wanted to hear the answer.</p><p>“Our mother died on a routine job, cleaning out a fledgling vampire nest,” Teo said. “She died because she was drunk, and had been for years, drinking to kill the pain of a job that had ceased to have any meaning for her. She got drunk and she got sloppy and she got killed by a hungry newborn. Pathetic.”</p><p>The telekinetic power in Xochi’s hand faltered and Teo pushed her advantage.</p><p>“After that,” Teo said, “the job ceased to have any kind of deep spiritual meaning for me either. I saw it for the hollow lie it really was and realized that the only thing that mattered in this life is the pleasure you can squeeze out of every day.”</p><p>“And killing me will bring you pleasure?” Xochi demanded. “Your own flesh and blood? Is that how depraved you have become?”</p><p>“Your death will bring me no pleasure, little sister,” Teo said. “Only the pleasure of victory.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Claudia,” Sam said, raising the Magnum and drawing a bead on Elvia. “Step back.”</p><p>“No,” Claudia cried, pushing Elvia’s knotted hair back from her tear-stained face. “No, there has to be another way.”</p><p>“Look at her,” Sam said. “She’s dying anyway—can’t you see? We have to close the gate. We have no choice.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Claudia,” Dean said. “But there is no other way.”</p><p>“There is,” Claudia said. “Remember, Dean, you told me there’s always a choice.” She turned to Elvia, whispering in Spanish, then English. “Change me.”</p><p>“What?” Dean took a step closer to Claudia. “No way, I’m not gonna let you do that. Come on, you don’t have to be all tough just to impress me.”</p><p>Claudia looked up at Dean, anger in her eyes.</p><p>“This isn’t about you,” she said. “This is our only hope. Even if you kill her now, it’s too late to close the gate. Look, the Clawed Butterfly is already coming through. But if I become a Borderwalker, then together Elvia and I can carry the Star Demons back through the gate. She doesn’t have the strength to do it alone.”</p><p>“She can’t change you,” Sam said flatly. “Borderwalkers can only share the Coyote’s Kiss with dying women.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence. Iztpapalotl was fully formed now and starting to crawl out through the gate, huge gray-and-black moth wings unfurling and brushing the ceiling.</p><p>Then Claudia had the silver knife in her hand. The one with the Blessed Virgin on the handle, given to her by the silversmith in Chihuahua.</p><p>“No!” Dean yelled. “NO!”</p><p>Claudia plunged the knife into her own chest.</p><h2><span id="chapter-49">CHAPTER 49</span><a href="#chapter-49" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Change me,” Claudia said, bleeding and collapsing against her mother. “Change me, or we all die.”</p><p>Dean ran to Claudia’s side, but Elvia took her daughter’s hand, tears spilling down her pale cheeks as she reached out to touch Claudia’s face. The two of them levitated up off the cracked floor, flickering, shifting, and twisting as Elvia’s power flowed into her daughter. Claudia’s face became a coyote’s face, then human again, her heart visible and glowing through the skin of her chest.</p><p>The two of them flowed like drifting, intertwining smoke moving toward the gate and the almost fully emerged Star Demon. Claudia grabbed one of the demon’s bony shoulders and Elvia the other and together they pulled Itzpapalotl back down into the void.</p><p>The Clawed Butterfly screamed as she spiraled down and away, the sound violent and deafening inside the storefront. The gate was reversing, a black hole now pulling everything toward it. Sam and Dean hung on to the exposed struts to stop themselves from being sucked into the nothingness. But Xochi and Teo were loose and were rolling across the floor, forced toward the gate.</p><p>Xochi managed to grab hold of a flapping tarp with one hand. Teo was digging her fingers into one of the cracks in the floor, fighting to hold on and losing. She had dropped Itztlitlantl and the knife lay just within Xochi’s reach, but was swiftly sliding away toward the gate.</p><p>Xochi realized she had a choice: she could grab the knife or grab her sister’s hand. Even now, it was no choice at all.</p><p>“Teo!” she cried. “Take my hand!”</p><p>Her sister looked up at her, eyes stony and guarded as ever. She lunged for the sliding knife instead, gripping it and slashing at Xochi. Xochi flinched away and Teo went tumbling down into the void, Itztlitlantl clutched to her chest.</p><p>The tarp Xochi was holding on to started to tear.</p><p>“Xochi!” Dean yelled, diving for her and managing to catch one of her kicking boots just as the tarp tore loose, flapping away like a bat into the yawning gate.</p><p>He held fast to her ankle, hooking his other arm around a nearby support beam.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” he shouted. “I’ve got you!”</p><p>The minivan that had been lodged in the store window came loose and flew down the gaping throat of the gate. Right behind it, first one, then the other, de-fanged Star Demon, screeching and flailing as they fell. A dozen zombies came swarming in after them through the now open storefront.</p><p>Dean could let go of Xochi to draw his gun or hang on to her and wait for them both to be eaten alive.</p><p>But, as the demons were swallowed up by the void, each one vomited up a coiling stream of bluish-white light. The light shattered into fragments, engulfing each of the oncoming zombies and stopping them in their tracks. They fell to their knees one after another, covering their faces with their hands.</p><p>For a moment, Claudia was visible in the mouth of the gateway, condor wings spread wide, eyes bright and heart burning. She raised her hand to Dean, then fell away, the void folding in around her as the gate closed, leaving nothing but a plain concrete wall.</p><p>Xochi struggled to her knees, leaning heavily against Dean. He held her for a long minute, unable to do anything else. It was a grim victory, resonant with painful losses. They were both shell-shocked, beaten and bruised to hell and back. But they were glad to be alive.</p><p>Sam offered Dean a hand, pulling him to his feet. Dean in turn helped Xochi.</p><p>“We did it,” Sam said.</p><p>“Claudia did it,” Xochi corrected him.</p><p>“I’m sorry about your sister,” Dean said.</p><p>“I know,” Xochi replied flatly. “She made her choice. Like we all do.”</p><p>All around them, the former zombies were getting to their wobbly feet. They seemed disoriented and confused, but otherwise back to normal.</p><p>Xochi grabbed an older man in a Hawaiian shirt and spoke to him in Spanish. He replied, a puzzled look on his face.</p><p>“They remember nothing,” she said. “When the demons were pulled back through the gate, they spit out all the souls they had eaten. The souls went back into their owners but it seems the owners have no memory of the events that happened while they were soulless.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. Didn’t say anything. Xochi put one arm around Dean’s waist and the other around Sam’s.</p><p>“Come on,” she said. “Let me take you boys home.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-50">CHAPTER 50</span><a href="#chapter-50" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the street outside Chato’s body shop in Nogales, Arizona, Dean stood by the driver’s-side door of the running Impala. He had a lurid, bilingual newspaper in his hand, headline reading “DRUG RIOT IN MEXICO CITY SLUM!” It didn’t surprise him at all that no one believed what had really happened. They never did.</p><p>He tossed the paper in the back seat, watching Sam hand Xochi her gun-belt from the open trunk. She buckled it securely around her hips, fastening the straps around her thighs and checking both pistols. Sam closed the trunk and turned away, looking down the road, but she took his face between her hands and turned him back to her. She stretched up on tip-toe, looking intently into Sam’s eyes and speaking softly to him. Dean couldn’t hear what she was saying. “Gimme Shelter” by the Rolling Stones was blasting from the Impala’s speakers.</p><p>Then Xochi turned to Dean and came to him slow, sliding her arms around him like she had done that first night. This time he didn’t push her away.</p><p>“Dean—“ she began.</p><p>“Stay,” he said, hushing her by pressing the pad of his thumb against her parted lips, fingers tracing the strong curve of her jaw. “Just for tonight.”</p><p>She closed her eyes and leaned into him. Mick Jagger was wailing for shelter. Dean felt like he’d forgotten the meaning of the word until that moment. Not home. Not happily ever after. Just one night out of the rain. Just shelter. He could feel a thousand knots coming unbound inside him. He cupped his hand around the back of Xochi’s neck and kissed her.</p><p>It was not a sweet, romantic kiss. It was rough, aching, and full of hunger. A survivor’s kiss. And she kissed him back, just as hard and just as hungry. Everything else went away.</p><p>Until she broke the kiss and stepped back, pulling free from his embrace. There was desire in her dark eyes, but also a melancholy kind of understanding. Even though the night was warm, his body felt chilled where she was no longer pressed against him. He had to curl his hands into fists to stop them from reaching for her.</p><p>“Go to your brother,” she said. “He needs you. He can’t tell you this, but he does. It seems to me, he has fulfilled his destiny, and now you must help him get his soul back. Stop at nothing. Whatever it takes.”</p><p>“But...”</p><p>“Goodbye, Dean,” she said.</p><p>Dean watched her walk away, down the dusty road, for as long as he could. Watching the swing of her long braids, moving in rhythm with her pistol-packing hips. Wanting her to turn around. Willing her to turn around. She didn’t.</p><p>He turned back to Sam.</p><p>His kid brother was standing by the rear bumper, big hands stuffed in his pockets and shoulders hunched, lost in thought. After everything they’d been through, Sam still seemed so impossibly young, still the same pensive kid he’d always been, so full of unrecognized potential. Dean felt like he was a hundred years old and then some. He walked over to Sam, mock-punched him on the shoulder.</p><p>“Come on, Sammy,” he said. “Let’s get the hell out of here. We got work to do.”</p><p>Dean got behind the wheel of the Impala. Sam took the shotgun seat. As Dean pulled away from the curb and headed north, the Rolling Stones song ended and another song started up.</p><p>“Carry On, Wayward Son,” by Kansas.</p><p>That’s just what Dean did.</p><p><strong>THE END</strong></p><h2><span id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><a href="#acknowledgments" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Thanks to H.

Occasionally, he sat on one of the secured wrought-iron benches to rest his perpetually sore feet, which had worn down the soles of his scuffed boots to the intimation of rice paper. Mostly, he spent the evening hours circling the restaurant district, eight square blocks encompassing the most popular sit-down restaurants, asking for handouts.</p><p>Whether people were about to sit down to a good meal, or returning to their cars after enjoying a fine repast, his strategy was to impart a touch of guilt on these more fortunate citizens. With a notoriously bad economy struggling to right itself, Shelburn remained on the bottom looking up. Not that it was much consolation to a man who had lost his wife to a lengthy illness, his job to subsequent neglect in unforgiving times, and his house to dispassionate bankers, but his current disenfranchised condition lacked the stigma of years past. With record unemployment and housing foreclosures “There but for the grace of God, go I” had become a familiar refrain.</p><p>The decline and fall of Gavin Shelburn had begun in advance of the so-called Great Recession, but he wasn’t above accepting the sympathy of those still gainfully employed to keep his stomach, if not full, then at least occasionally mindful of its gastric function. To that end, he made his nightly rounds wearing a battered fedora—which he unfailingly tipped to the ladies and regularly flipped over to accommodate folded donations—along with a rumpled overcoat that also served as his blanket and fell to the top of his second-hand combat boots. His gaunt torso gained some bulk from the two button-down shirts he wore, one over the other, though he switched the layers each day in lieu of regular laundering. Combined, the two shirts had a complement of buttons sufficient for one. His threadbare jeans retained a hint of their original black color.</p><p>On most nights, the reliable combination of sympathy, guilt and polite panhandling kept Shelly’s stomach fed and, yes, his spirits warm, while steering clear of Chief Quinn’s holding cell. But the lingering effects of a poor economy led to slow evenings in the restaurant district, especially on weeknights. He’d reached the outskirts of his bread-andbutter zone, near the smaller pizza joints which offered slim pickings at the best of times, and was about to head back, when a middle-aged woman rushed out of Joe’s Pizza Shack with a large pizza box and a two liter bottle of Coke.</p><p>“Good evening, Madam,” he said, tipping his multipurpose fedora.</p><p>“Oh,” she said, startled, pausing in her dash to her car, a white Nissan idling at an unfed parking meter. “All right.” She set the pizza box on the hood of the car, fished a crumpled dollar bill out of her purse and dropped it in his hat. “Here ya go.”</p><p>“Thank you, Madam,” he said, graciously accepting the dollar, which he stuffed into his left pocket since the right had a hole that had traveled the entire length of the seam.</p><p>With a careless wave she gathered up her pizza box, jumped in the car, and sped off.</p><p>A fine white mist roiled in her wake, seeming to seep in from the side streets and roll past him, lending an unearthly quality to the gritty areas that lay beyond the reach of the urban gentrification of the downtown district. More than isolated, he felt... abandoned, as if reality, along with the suburban woman, had decided to move on without him.</p><p>He stood for a moment, staring after her car, before pushing the fedora back down over his thinning, prematurely gray hair, and turned back the way he had come. Despite momentary delusions to the contrary, his reality had not changed. Though it had become routine, his life remained unpleasant, with no guarantees. But these days, he thought, nobody has any guarantees.</p><p>Over the course of the slow evening, he’d collected enough to pay for a few slices of pizza and a beverage to call his own, but it was too soon to reward himself with a meal or a drink—alcoholic or otherwise. Within the next hour, the last wave of sated diners would be heading home to park themselves in front of their high-definition plasma screens. Surely a few would spare a buck or two for a neighbor who had fallen on hard times?</p><p>Ignoring a protracted grumble of protest from his stomach, he continued his trek back toward the heart of the restaurant district. He hadn’t gotten far, when he heard another sound behind him, a scrape like steel on concrete followed by a sudden, slurping hiss.</p><p>Startled, he whirled around. And staggered backward in disbelief.</p><p>“What the hell?” he whispered.</p><p>It wasn’t possible.</p><p>His right hand patted the flask tucked into his overcoat pocket. Almost full. He hadn’t touched the stuff. Was saving it for later, when he would hunker down for another fitful night’s sleep. But even if he had drained every drop, it couldn’t explain what he saw.</p><p>It was easily as long as two Nissans. A giant lizard, with a black pebbled face, its long powerful body and massive tail banded with bright orange. A name bubbled up from his subconscious, planted there in his grade school years and not quite forgotten.</p><p>Gila monster.</p><p>Its forked tongue, long as a pink yardstick, flickered out toward him, tasting the air. Then its jaws spread open, revealing a row of sharp teeth lining a mouth that could accommodate his head and entire torso in a single bite.</p><p>He remembered something else about Gila monsters. They released venom in their saliva, a nasty neurotoxin that would paralyze their prey.</p><p>“Sweet Jesus...”</p><p>Unable to tear his gaze away from the monstrous lizard, Shelly stumbled back several paces. These creatures were supposed to be slow—but they were also supposed to be less than two feet long. This one was twenty times that size.</p><p>It took a step toward him, one set of sharp claws scraping the pavement beneath it. The tongue flicked out again. Then all four legs began to churn forward in an alternating stride that covered ground much too quickly for Shelly’s liking.</p><p>Turning his back on the enormous creature, he ran almost doubled over, out of control. Behind him, the raking claws stuck the concrete in a frightening, metronomic rhythm that gained in volume as the distance between him and the creature withered away.</p><p>“Help! Somebody, help me!” he screamed breathlessly.</p><p>His voice seemed lost in the night, silenced by the blanket of mist and his total isolation. Never had he felt more alone on the streets of Clayton Falls than at that moment. Gasping in a breath to scream again, he felt the monster’s long, forked tongue, sticky with what he imagined a lethal dose of venom, strafe his stubble-covered cheek.</p><p>He squealed in uncontrolled fright, his heart pounding so hard he thought it would burst in his chest like a bloodfilled grenade. Claws slapped down on his right heel and the combat boot was wrenched off his foot, twisting his ankle painfully to the side. Staggering, he barely managed to maintain his balance, but knew his time had run out, so he veered left, into an alley behind a Chinese restaurant.</p><p>The hot breath of the giant Gila monster washed over the back of his neck.</p><p>Shelly heard a loud thump as the creature’s enormous tail stuck a parking meter.</p><p>The alley ran all the way through to Bell Street, but he couldn’t outrun the creature here, either. In seconds he would be devoured close to where he often scavenged for discarded food himself, right out of the—</p><p>He veered to the left, raised his left arm up to the edge of the shadowy bulk of the restaurant’s Dumpster and heaved himself over the lip and down into the damp and malodorous refuse.</p><p>No sooner had he landed in the cushion of garbage than something, probably the Gila monster’s head, stuck the side of the Dumpster and propelled it down the alley. Metal shrieked against the brick wall opposite the rear of the Chinese restaurant. The Dumpster trundled spastically as its undersized wheels squealed in protest.</p><p>Abruptly, the jittery motion stopped.</p><p>Shelly held his breath. All he heard was the thunderous beating of his overtaxed heart. As he pushed himself up to a sitting position, something powerful struck the side of the Dumpster, dimpling the steel right between his feet, and rocking the container back into the brick wall. Another protracted screech as the creature’s claws raked the exterior.</p><p>Shelly remembered another unfortunate fact about Gila monsters.</p><p>They could climb.</p><p>And this one was large enough to raise itself over the edge of the Dumpster.</p><p>He was cornered.</p><p>Frantically, he swept his hands through the slimy and sticky refuse, searching for something sharp or hard, anything that could serve as a weapon. His search became more desperate when he saw the creature’s claws wrap around the rim of the Dumpster like a matching set of butcher knives. The trash bin began to tilt forward as the creature’s weight pressed down on it. Shelly heard an explosive pop as of one of the wheels sheared off the base. It was only a matter of seconds before the pebbled head, beady black eyes, and grotesquely long, forked tongue would rise over him and block out the sky.</p><p>Shelly’s foraging hand slammed into a wooden slat. He blindly traced its dimensions because he refused to look away from the Dumpster’s opening. A produce crate! he realized. Flimsy, but if he broke it apart he could use one of the slats as a makeshift dagger. Poke its eye out and maybe it would go elsewhere for its next meal.</p><p>Abruptly the Dumpster eased back and bumped into the brick wall.</p><p>Long seconds passed before Shelly realized the claws were gone. One moment they’d been pressed against the steel, the next they were absent. He waited a minute, motionless, listening intently for any sound. Gradually, he became aware of the ambient noise of the night. The rumble of passing trucks, the hiss of tires on asphalt, the toot of distant horns... his own ragged breathing.</p><p>He rolled onto his hands and knees and reached for the edge of the Dumpster, slowing pulling himself up out of the garbage, his head rising above the surface like a periscope in enemy waters. He peered along the length of the alley, left and right.</p><p>Nothing. As if the lizard had dropped off the face of the earth.</p><p>“I’ll be damned.”</p><p>“This town is so lame.”</p><p>Eighteen-year-old Steven Bullinger drained his second can of beer, crumpled the empty aluminum can and tossed it into one of the decorative bushes that ringed the tarnished bronze statues of Charles Clayton and Jeremiah Falls at the center of Founders Park.</p><p>Tony Lacosta shook his head. “You say that every night.”</p><p>“Yeah, Bullinger,” Lucy Quinn said. “You need new material.” She stood between them, facing the opposite direction, hands stuffed into the pockets of her hoodie, which was hot pink and densely patterned with tiny black skulls. She was the lookout.</p><p>The bronze nineteenth-century pioneers were depicted astride their horses, angled away from each other in a V-shape, illuminated by recessed floodlights. Clayton pointed into the distance, possibly indicating the site of the present municipal building, while Falls pulled up on his horse’s reins. But the three teens did not choose their loitering spot out of any sense of civic pride. The benches directly behind the bronze horses were obstructed from view and cloaked in shadow at night, beyond the harsh glare of the monument’s floodlights.</p><p>Steven grumbled, “Making sure you were paying attention.”</p><p>“You could leave.”</p><p>“Thinking about it,” Steven said sullenly. “Weighing my options.”</p><p>“Right,” Tony said. “Toss me a beer before you drink them all.”</p><p>Steven slipped his hand into the open backpack he’d set on the park bench next to him and tossed a can to Tony. He looked at Lucy. “You want one?”</p><p>She shook her head. “I’m good.” Drinking was the furthest thing from her mind.</p><p>“You don’t drink no more, is that it?”</p><p>“No,” she said defensively. “It’s not that.”</p><p>“Worried your dad will catch you?” Steven persisted.</p><p>“No,” she said, then sighed. “Maybe. He is the chief of police.”</p><p>“And you have him wrapped around your finger.”</p><p>She scoffed. “I wish.”</p><p>“What’s the real reason?” Tony asked, index finger poised over the tab, waiting to open the can.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said and shrugged. “The timing.”</p><p>“What? Not late enough for you?” Steven asked.</p><p>Tony heaved an exasperated sigh. “She’s talking about Teddy, you dumbass.”</p><p>“Yesterday was the one-year anniversary,” Lucy said. “You guys don’t think about the accident?”</p><p>“Sure I do,” Steven said defensively. “Don’t see me driving, do you?”</p><p>“Jackass!” Lucy said, kicking him in the shin.</p><p>“What the hell?” Steven seemed more upset about dropping his third can of beer than about the kick. He scooped it off the ground before much had spilled. A thin white mist had rolled across the park grounds, progressing in eddies and swirls. Steven only gave it a moment’s notice. “I didn’t mean anything by it!”</p><p>“So being a jerk comes naturally?”</p><p>“More like constant practice,” Tony said, smirking.</p><p>“Shut up,” Steven said to him. Then he turned to Lucy. “Look, a year ago that’s all people talked about. Every time they saw me. Any of us walk into a room or if they passed us on the street. Can’t say I miss that. Ever since the factory fire... All I’m saying is, I get to deal with it on my own terms now. Without people shoving it in my face all the time.”</p><p>Lucy crossed her arms and glared at him. “Excuse me if I don’t want to forget about Teddy.”</p><p>“I don’t—I didn’t say—Tony, talk to her.”</p><p>“None of us want to forget Teddy,” Tony said. “He was your boyfriend, but we knew him since grade school. And we were all... stupid that night. But dwelling on it? I don’t think that’s.… What’s wrong? Cops?”</p><p>Lucy was staring at the statues. Her eyes were wide, her green irises ringed with white. She pointed. “Three—three horses.”</p><p>Tony followed her gaze. Steven twisted around on the bench, looking over his shoulder. Moving within the V created by the horses of Clayton and Falls was another horse, a black stallion. Its hooves clopped on the marble base of the life-sized monument and it snorted as its rider steered it away from the bronze tableau, between two benches and through a gap in the decorative bushes.</p><p>“It’s coming for us,” Lucy said.</p><p>“What?” Steven looked from her to Tony.</p><p>Tony dropped his beer can. “What the hell?”</p><p>The rider was clad in black, a riding cloak, shirt, trousers and boots. But the first thing Lucy noticed was his head. Rather, his lack of a head. The cloak was tied around the trunk of his neck, but the neck ended in a ragged, bloody stump. No head... and yet she had the feeling he could see everything. He seemed to be staring right at her through invisible eyes.</p><p>The rider held the horse’s reins bunched in his left hand because his right hand held a gleaming sword.</p><p>“Run!” Tony yelled.</p><p>Lucy was paralyzed. In that moment, she was sure she would have stood still as the headless horseman shoved the sword straight through her heart. But Tony grabbed one of her suddenly clammy hands and tugged her sideways. She stumbled after him, looking back, unable to take her eyes off the nightmarish apparition that had materialized out of thin air.</p><p>Steven trailed behind them, mainly because he had paused to grab his beer-filled backpack.</p><p>The horse whinnied and reared up on its hind legs. The rider kicked spurs into the horse’s flanks and it dropped down to all fours and galloped after them, its hooves pounding the earth with deadly determination. Lucy could feel the vibration in her shins and thought she would throw up any second. She realized she was sobbing.</p><p>Steven hadn’t paused to zip up his backpack. Every few strides a beer can slipped free and tumbled to the ground, letting out a protesting hiss of pressurized foam. Finally, he cursed and tossed the backpack aside.</p><p>Lucy couldn’t help glancing back every other step. She stumbled again and again, but Tony’s momentum kept her upright. She saw the horseman bear down on Steven and swing his sword in a whistling arc, determined to reduce the young man to his own headless condition or perhaps remedy his cranial loss by random substitution. Lucy gave an involuntary shriek.</p><p>The gleaming blade missed Steven’s neck by a whisker.</p><p>Steven must have felt its swift passage. He clapped a hand to the nape of his neck, as if checking for blood.</p><p>They were near the edge of the park, within sight of the municipal building, when Lucy was jerked to the side. She stumbled and fell against Tony for a moment before he led her to the right.</p><p>“What—?” she began.</p><p>“We need to split up,” Tony said, his breathing ragged.</p><p>“Can’t chase all of us.”</p><p>“But Steve...”</p><p>The vibration in her legs was gone. She glanced back but could no longer see the headless horseman. In his gray sweatshirt and faded jeans, Steven was a blur of motion running and stumbling toward Park Lane.</p><p>“C’mon,” Tony said, pulling her attention back. “Think we lost him.”</p><p>“What was that?”</p><p>“Sure as hell wasn’t the neighborhood watch.”</p><p>Steven had never run so fast in his life. At some point, between tossing aside the backpack he’d used to smuggle beer out of the house and feeling the horseman’s sword whistle past his neck, he forgot about everything that had led up to the nightmarish chase. He stopped questioning the impossibility of a man without a head riding a horse that had appeared out of nowhere. Every iota of his concentration focused on racing from his imminent death, while suppressing the powerful urge to vomit up every last ounce of beer he had imbibed. A single hesitation, for whatever reason, would mean the difference between life and death. Even so, a man, even a sober man, couldn’t outrun a horse for long. Steven veered close to tree trunks, favoring those with low hanging limbs. Unseat the horseman and the chase turned in his favor. But it seemed he couldn’t shake the headless rider, only postpone the inevitable. The thunderous rumble of hooves was never more than one false step away.</p><p>Face contorted in a rictus of pain, he burst from the edge of the park, bounded across the wide sidewalk and sprinted onto Park Lane. Several steps into his panicked flight across the blacktop, he stumbled and almost fell to his knees. Doubled over, he cringed, waiting for the hard steel to bite into his flesh. Then it occurred to him that the thundering noise of hooves had stopped. He looked back and saw that the headless horseman had vanished. He had never followed Steven out of the park.</p><p>Steven straightened and peered behind him. Nothing moving between the trees. No horse. No headless rider. Looking left and right, he couldn’t see Tony or Lucy. Vaguely he recalled them veering to the side, away from his mindless, straight-line flight. Sensible strategy, but he would have had their back.</p><p>Or would he?</p><p>Staring back at the park, he wondered if the horseman was confined within its boundaries. If his friends remained in the park now, were they in danger? Would the rider seek them out after his solo target had escaped? Steven could go back and warn them... but he had no idea where they had gone. Was the horseman even real? Could they have imagined the whole thing? When you really thought about it, it made no sense. How could it? Unless...something in the beer? Product tampering? LSD in the cans? No, because Lucy had seen it first and she hadn’t had any beer. Then how—?</p><p>BEEP!</p><p>A battered Ford pickup truck swerved around him, the driver leaving behind a string of curses with the truck’s pungent white exhaust.</p><p>Steven looked down at the painted line and realized that he’d pulled up in the middle of Park Lane. Fortunately for him, traffic was light in the evening. And the white exhaust was really spreading...</p><p>Not exhaust. The white, cottony mist he’d barely acknowledged in the park had spread out across the road, swirling around his ankles.</p><p>An accelerating motor—a deep-throated roar—drew his attention up again but this vehicle didn’t swerve.</p><p>He had a moment to register the color red, with a white stripe across the hood leading his eye to the driver, but—</p><p>Air exploded out of his lungs as his legs shattered and his body flipped through the air, bounding across the hood of the car, skipping past the windshield and tumbling up and away from the roof as if gravity had suddenly released any claim to his mass. But just as suddenly, it reclaimed him with punishing force, slamming him down onto the blacktop as if swatted from above by a giant hand. His head struck and his skull seemed to lose its rigidity, his vision splitting into two separate views a split second before one side went completely dark and the other began to fade.</p><p>Somewhere he heard a woman scream.</p><p>A man looked down at him, shock on his face.</p><p>“Oh, God,” Steven heard him say.</p><p>Steven wanted to tell the man not to worry, but the words came out jumbled and seemed to originate far away. Didn’t help that he was shivering as he spoke.</p><p>“I can’t believe—that guy—he hit you on purpose!” the man declared.</p><p>Steven tried to shake his head. Big mistake. Pain knifed through him so fiercely he blacked out for a second. Maybe longer. When the man’s pale face returned, this time with a cell phone pressed to his ear, Steven tried to explain what he saw before the moment of impact but only the last two words made it past his numb lips.</p><p>“...nobody driving.”</p><p>“What—?”</p><p>A young woman stepped into Steven’s diminishing field of vision. She grabbed the man’s arm.</p><p>“I—I can’t believe it!” she said. Her voice sounded distant and hollow.</p><p>“I called an ambulance,” the man told her.</p><p>“—tried to get the license plate,” she said, glancing briefly at Steven, long enough for him to see the horror and disbelief on her face before she looked away. “Blake, I—I couldn’t.”</p><p>“That’s okay,” he said. “It happened so fast.”</p><p>“That’s not what I mean,” she said. Her words were out of sync with her lips, as if she were an actress in a poorly dubbed foreign film. Movement began to leave smears of color across Steven’s vision. “I was looking right at the car and it... vanished.”</p><p>“Vanished how?”</p><p>Like the headless horseman? Steven wondered.</p><p>“I don’t know how,” she said. “One second it was there. And the next it was gone.”</p><p>Steven blinked, but when he opened his eyes there was only darkness. He thought they might still be talking above him but the only sound he heard was a soft, rhythmic thumping, fading and slowing and then nothing...</p><h2><span id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</span><a href="#chapter-1" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The beam of Dean Winchester’s flashlight played over the pair of stained manacles dangling from an eyebolt mounted in the back of a stall in Cletus Gillmer’s horse stable. He didn’t need a forensic kit to guess the nature of the stains.</p><p>“Sick bastard kept the victims chained back here,” he said.</p><p>Across the aisle, his brother Sam examined the tack room, dominated by a sturdy wooden work table with eyebolts screwed into the surface at each corner.</p><p>“And chopped them up over here,” Sam responded.</p><p>“Not what old man Gillmer had in mind when he asked junior to take over the family farm.”</p><p>They’d found Cletus Gillmer in the farmhouse, sprawled on an old recliner patched with duct tape, his eyes bulging and bloodshot, his tongue protruding and his throat savagely crushed. On the round table beside him, he’d left behind an old, loaded revolver and a curious, apparently interrupted, to-do list. After “siphon gasoline from generator,” “bury body,” and “burn stable,” he’d written “burn” a second time before dropping the pen on the floor. Dean guessed that “burn farmhouse” would have been next, followed by “insert revolver in mouth” and “pull trigger.” Apparently old man Gillmer had grown weary of chasing thrill-seeking teens off his property, but not before somebody else decided to punch his ticket.</p><p>A local newspaper’s piece on the five-year anniversary of the machete killings and the sudden, mysterious disappearance of Cletus’ murderous son, Clive Gillmer, had created an urban legend to test the mettle of a new crop of teenagers. From deranged serial killer to phantom bogeyman in five years. The old man tried to scare the kids away, garnering “crazy old coot” status, but some had gone missing nonetheless. Dean suspected the old man knew what the Winchesters did: bogeymen have teeth.</p><p>On their way out of the farmhouse, Sam spotted the pink sneaker in the high grass beside the front porch steps, bathed in moonlight. Their flashlights had revealed the young woman with a broken neck stuffed under the crawlspace. And so the to-do list had led them to the horse stable...</p><p>As Dean walked toward the second stall—duffel bag hanging from his left shoulder, shotgun loaded with rock salt cradled under his right arm—he heard Sam open and search one of the tack trunks under the table.</p><p>“Dean!” he called. “Found a machete.”</p><p>“Keep looking,” Dean said absently. “Junior’s body’s gotta be here.”</p><p>He opened the next stall door with the tip of his shotgun. The eyebolt in this one was angled down. Dean grabbed it, wiggled it back and forth, felt the wood planking give, bits of rotted wood falling away like damp mulch. His flashlight flickered—</p><p>A loud crash broke the eerie silence of the stable.</p><p>Dean whirled. “Sam!”</p><p>Looming over him was the six-foot-seven, three-hundredpound vengeful spirit of Clive Gillmer, in mottled whiteface, wearing the traditional black-and-white striped shirt under blood-stained bib overalls. “The Machete Mime,” as the press had dubbed him.</p><p>Dean swung the shotgun up, but the Mime clubbed his arm away and rammed him against the back wall with enough force to split the weakened boards. The shotgun fell from his numb fingers along with the flashlight.</p><p>“Sam! Little help!”</p><p>Before Sam regained his soul, Dean was never sure when his brother would have his back. But that was before. Now...</p><p>The Mime picked Dean up and slammed him against the wall to the right and then to the left. Both were in better shape than the rear wall, if the sharp pain in his ribs was any judge.</p><p>“Marcel Machete here has anger management issues!” Dean yelled.</p><p>He dodged a fist which punched a hole in the wall next to his head, but caught a knee in the gut and dropped to the ground, stunned.</p><p>The crash he’d heard earlier, after Sam discovered the machete...</p><p>“Sammy!”</p><p>Face it. Sam’s out of commission.</p><p>Dean heard a clanking of chains, then felt cold steel encircle his neck, bite into his flesh and inexorably tighten.</p><p>He managed to slip his fingers under the chain and alleviate the pressure long enough to suck in some air and clear his vision. His other hand scrabbled across the matted straw of the dirt floor until his fingers closed around the barrel of his shotgun.</p><p>The Mime’s booted foot kicked Dean’s arm against the wall and once again the shotgun slipped from his grasp. Dean’s vision began to dim again, fading to black at the edges, when he heard a shotgun blast from above.</p><p>In an instant, the pressure of the chains around his neck was gone and he was stumbling forward onto hands and knees, coughing and gasping for air.</p><p>Sam stood in the aisle, shotgun braced in his hands. His jacket was torn at the shoulder seam and a line of blood trickled from his scalp.</p><p>“He surprised me,” he stated.</p><p>Dean nodded. “Makes two of us,” he rasped.</p><p>Dean grabbed his own shotgun and Sam helped him to his feet. Brushing straw off his clothes, Dean scanned the ground for his flashlight and found it near the back wall of the stall.</p><p>“Let’s find the body before Baby Huey comes back,” he said, scooping it up.</p><p>“Don’t think it’s here,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean didn’t respond.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam said.</p><p>Dean stared through the gap in the broken back wall. He kicked a split plank out of the way.</p><p>“Behind the farmhouse,” he said. “You see that?”</p><p>Sam looked past his shoulder. “Wooden shed.”</p><p>“We assumed the old man planned to burn the farmhouse after the stable.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Clive knew his father’s real target.”</p><p>They slipped through the gap in the wall and raced along the corral fence, behind the farmhouse to the unprepossessing tool shed in back. Ten feet square, it was open in front, revealing three walls with hooks for various farm implements long ago removed. The floor was covered with mismatched scraps of outdoor carpeting littered with old leaves, yellowed sections of torn newsprint and snack food wrappers.</p><p>“Nothing,” Dean said flatly. “More nothing.”</p><p>Sam walked into the shed, probing the corners of the single room with his flashlight beam. Boards squeaked under his weight. He stopped, looked down, then back up at Dean.</p><p>“You thinking what I’m thinking?”</p><p>“Root cellar?”</p><p>Sam crouched, lifted a few uneven squares of carpet and tossed them aside, revealing twin wooden doors secured by an old padlock with an elongated shackle.</p><p>“Bolt cutters?”</p><p>“Try this,” Dean said, passing him a crowbar from his duffel.</p><p>Slipping the straight end under one of the door handles, Sam levered it up and out of the rotting wood until the screws popped out. He repeated the process on the other handle and wiggled the padlock free.</p><p>“Here goes.”</p><p>He wedged the crowbar under the edge of the right-hand door and raised it enough to slip his fingers under it. He flung it open to the squeal of protesting hinges.</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>The stench assailed them like a physical presence.</p><p>Left hand pressed against his nose, Sam leaned over and flipped open the other door. Dean’s flashlight beam speared the darkness at the bottom of the rickety staircase and revealed the hulking corpse in the remnants of a striped shirt and bib overalls, curled on its stomach, with a pitchfork buried in its back.</p><p>Deep enough to puncture lungs, Dean thought. Or skewer his heart.</p><p>“Old man put him down five years ago. Left him to rot,” he said.</p><p>“Let everyone assume he’d run off,” Sam said.</p><p>He reached down for his own duffel bag and so was caught by surprise.</p><p>Flickering into existence between them, the Mime’s spirit charged—</p><p>“Sam!”</p><p>—and shoved Sam down the stairs.</p><p>Both root-cellar doors slammed shut.</p><p>Junior spun around and rushed Dean, his marred white face stretched wide in a hideous grin that revealed years of dental neglect.</p><p>“I’ve seen your act, Tiny,” Dean said grimly, taking a step back to pump the shotgun’s action and level the barrel at the killer Mime. “It blows.”</p><p>He blasted a round of rock salt into the spirit’s torso.</p><p>The Mime vanished, buying them some more time.</p><p>Dean slammed the action bar down and back to chamber another round.</p><p>Then, rushing into the shed, he flipped the doors open and aimed his flashlight into the darkness.</p><p>“Sam! Sammy!” he called.</p><p>“Here, Dean,” came the reply. “I’m okay.”</p><p>Dean negotiated the rickety stairs, sweeping the underground room with his flashlight to reveal sagging multi-tiered wooden shelves lining the walls, filled with an assortment of mason jars and plastic containers, rotting vegetables and rancid salted meats long since abandoned. On the floor, sitting beside the decaying corpse, Sam massaged his neck with one hand while shielding his eyes from the light with the other.</p><p>“Let’s end this,” Dean said, tossing his brother a canister of sea salt. He rifled through his bag for the container of lighter fluid.</p><p>Sam climbed to his feet, pressed a hand to his lower back and winced. But he shook off the residual aches and pains of having rolled down the stairs and spread salt liberally over Clive’s remains.</p><p>“What is it with mimes anyway?” he wondered. “Clowns with a vow of silence?”</p><p>“This one forgot the rule about ‘no props,’” Dean replied.</p><p>Dean squeezed the aluminum container and flicked the stream of lighter fluid back and forth over the corpse, head to toe.</p><p>“Machete Mime.” Sam shook his head. “Light him up.”</p><p>Something took shape in the darkness.</p><p>Their flashlights dimmed.</p><p>“Dude, we’re not alone!”</p><p>Out of the shadows a beefy arm snaked around Sam’s throat and pulled him back into the darkness. They crashed into the shelving in the back of the root cellar, busting shelves and sending jars shattering against each other on the floor.</p><p>Blocking out the frantic sounds of Sam’s dire struggle, Dean fished his Zippo lighter out of his jacket pocket, flicked it to spark a flame, then tossed it on the Mime’s remains. As the fire caught hold, Dean heard Sam gasp and stumble forward across the shattered glass. The wooden handle of the pitchfork protruding from the Mime’s back caught fire and the racing flames quickly ignited the shelves to the right. In seconds, the fire swept along the back wall and then spread to the left. Dean realized that if it reached the stairs they’d find themselves trapped in their own private inferno.</p><p>“Sam!”</p><p>“Go!” Sam yelled, veering unsteadily around the burning corpse.</p><p>Dean caught Sam’s upper arm long enough to steady him, then shoved him toward the wooden staircase. Sam took the stairs two at a time. One of the boards cracked under his weight but Sam was up and out. The heat had become unbearable. Dean shielded his face with his arm, holding his breath and squinting through the roiling black smoke as he followed his brother. Flames scorched his heels as the hungry fire roared up out of the ground. He rolled clear of the shed, which was engulfed moments later, and gulped down huge mouthfuls of fresh Nebraska air.</p><p>Dean left the Impala parked at the curb and walked into a local tavern. With his ribs aching and his mouth tasting of bitter smoke, he wanted nothing more than a cold one or three to apply the layer of numbness he needed to sleep through the night.</p><p>It was a few hours before closing time, but the barroom was deserted. Tables, booths and stools were empty, the lone pool table unemployed, and the jukebox silent. A flat-screen TV angled over the bar displayed a soccer match in some other part of the world, the volume turned down to white noise hum. Other than Dean, the middle-aged bartender was the only person in the place.</p><p>Tapping the eraser end of a pencil against his teeth, the bartender was hunched over a pile of papers on the countertop with the concentration of someone working on his taxes. As Dean neared the bar, he saw the object of the man’s concentration was a horse racing form. The man looked up at his approach.</p><p>“Get you something?”</p><p>“Whatever you got on tap,” Dean said, sitting on the nearest stool. He rested his forearms on the padded edge of the counter and sighed. “Maybe a few peanuts.”</p><p>“Sure,” the bartender said, taking down a glass. “Quiet night, huh?”</p><p>“Didn’t start out that way.”</p><p>“Problems?”</p><p>“Same old same old.”</p><p>The bartender held the glass under the chrome faucet and pulled the brass lever. Amber liquid flowed into the glass, rising toward the brim. But at the halfway point, the beer level began to fall.</p><p>“That’s odd,” the bartender murmured.</p><p>“Hole in the glass?”</p><p>“No, no, the glass is fine.” Nonetheless, the bartender released the lever, set the glass aside and began to fill a replacement. Same result. As fast as the beer flowed into the glass, it seemed to... evaporate. “This makes no sense. Let me try another one.” He sidestepped to the next draft lever and repeated the process. Beer flowed into the glass and was as quickly gone. The bartender passed a hand over his closecropped blond hair. “This has never happened before.”</p><p>“First time for everything, pal.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s the CO2 tank. How about a bottle?”</p><p>Dean nodded. Tapped the countertop in front of him.</p><p>“Domestic? Import? Microbrew?”</p><p>“Let’s start with domestic and go from there.”</p><p>The bartender grabbed a long-necked brown bottle from under the counter, popped off the cap, releasing thin streams of vapor, and slid it across to Dean with the glass from the tap.</p><p>Dean decided to skip the middleman and raised the tip of the cold bottle to his lips. He tilted the bottle back and... nothing came out.</p><p>“What the hell?” he declared.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s empty.”</p><p>“That’s impossible.”</p><p>Dean upended the bottle over the glass. Not a drop fell out.</p><p>“Let me try that,” the bartender said, grabbing a fresh bottle. He eased it back and forth and liquid sloshed within the bottle. He then popped the cap and titled it over Dean’s glass. Wisps of vapor escaped the bottle and dissipated. A few drops of liquid struck the bottom of the glass and promptly evaporated. The bartender pushed the empty bottle aside and tried a third, and a fourth, different labels, all without success.</p><p>“Cans,” Dean said. “What about cans?”</p><p>The bartender opened a door behind the counter into a back room, and returned a moment later with a six-pack.</p><p>“These were delivered today,” he stated.</p><p>He pulled the tab off the first can and they heard a faint hiss as vapor spiraled out the opening. One can after another, the glass remained empty.</p><p>Dean shook his head. “This is not happening.”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” the bartender said. “What can I do?”</p><p>“Try something else,” Dean said. “Anything. Whiskey, rum, vodka. Peach schnapps!”</p><p>Nothing worked. The bartender tried Irish whiskey, Russian vodka, and Jamaican rum.</p><p>“I can’t explain this,” the bartender said, incredulous. “What does it mean?”</p><p>Dean noticed the audio hum emanating from the television set above the bar had changed. He glanced up and saw a news bulletin had replaced the soccer match. A telegenic news anchor in her late twenties spoke while a news crawl informed Dean one letter at a time that the world’s supply of alcoholic beverages had become unstable.</p><p>“The volume,” he said. “Turn it up!”</p><p>The bartender pointed a slim remote control at the set and raised the volume.</p><p>“...the scientific community remains baffled by the sudden and complete volatility of alcohol in any form.”</p><p>Dean stared aghast. “You gotta be kidding me!”</p><p>“This bar’s been in my family for sixty years,” the bartender said morosely. “And it’s all gone?”</p><p>The news anchor continued in an upbeat tone, “...face the new reality that we have become a nation, indeed an entire world, of teetotalers.”</p><p>“She’s smiling,” Dean said, pointing accusingly. “Why is she smiling? She can’t smile about this.”</p><p>“Oh, well,” the bartender said, now strangely at peace with the family-business-ending news. “How about something nonalcoholic?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said, backing away abruptly and knocking over his stool.</p><p>“Pop? Or milk?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Juice box? Bottled water?”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>“Got it,” the bartender said, snapping his fingers. “A Shirley Temple. No alcohol in that!”</p><p>“Dude! Seriously?”</p><p>Dean backed up to the door, tugged on the handle but the door wouldn’t open. In frustration, he pounded his fists on the wood panels.</p><p>“An egg cream?”</p><p>“Noooo!”</p><p>Dean sat upright, heart racing. A fleeting sense of displacement faded and he remembered where he was. The nondescript motel they’d checked into in Lincoln, Nebraska. He sat in the dark and fought the ridiculous urge to turn on CNN to confirm the safety of the world’s alcoholic beverages.</p><p>Across the room, sprawled on his bed as if sleep had been an afterthought, Sam mumbled something about hunters.</p><p>Dean stacked pillows against his headboard and laid back gingerly, enduring sharp protests from his ribs with each awkward movement. Felt as if he’d been kicked repeatedly by a mule with a sour disposition. Bedside clock radio told him he’d been asleep less than an hour. He’d need at least a few more before they hit the road. Coffee would take care of the rest.</p><p>“But no more dreams.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam Winchester stood in the root cellar again.</p><p>The underground storage room was empty. No shelves or mason jars or plastic containers. Even the Machete Mime’s corpse and the pitchfork that had killed him were gone. No evidence of the all-consuming fire.</p><p>He stood at the bottom of the wooden stairs, moonlight spilling across the floor on either side of him, but not reaching far enough to penetrate the darkness that shrouded the back of the room. And though the room seemed empty, Sam was not alone. A shape of equal height and mass stood within the shadows staring back at him.</p><p>“What do you want?” Sam asked.</p><p>“To replace you.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because I’m better at it than you are.”</p><p>Sam wanted to step forward, to reach into the darkness, but he was paralyzed where he stood, as if balanced on a precipice. One false step and he could fall; maybe never stop falling. He was close to something dangerous here. Had to be careful. He’d lost his way before. How many times could he go astray before it became impossible to find his way back to... himself?</p><p>The other took a step forward, emerging from the shadows. Like looking in a mirror, Sam stared at another version of himself. Sam without a soul. And that Sam was smirking at him.</p><p>“Your soul is a burden. It makes you weak.”</p><p>“You were out of control. You tried to kill Bobby to save yourself.”</p><p>“Self-preservation is an admirable trait in a hunter.” Soulless Sam walked around him in a loose circle while Sam struggled to move his legs. He was pinned to the spot.</p><p>“You were no different from the monsters you hunted.”</p><p>“Keep telling yourself that, Sammy,” he said. “We both know I was the more effective hunter.”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter,” Sam said. “You’re done.”</p><p>“Am I?” Soulless Sam asked. “Or... could be that soul of yours is a poor fit these days. Damaged goods. Might not stick around for the long haul. One little push—“ Soulless Sam poked him in the chest with a forefinger and Sam staggered back a step before regaining his balance—“and poof! I’m back in the driver’s seat.”</p><p>“No,” Sam said. “That’s not gonna happen.”</p><p>“You’d be surprised,” Soulless Sam said. “You’re not free of me. Never will be. I’m still in there, itching to get out.”</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Sam was frozen to the spot while Soulless Sam had complete freedom of movement. He walked behind Sam and paused at the staircase. Sam twisted his head around to keep Soulless Sam in view.</p><p>“Not as safe as you think you are.”</p><p>Soulless Sam climbed the creaking stairs. Before he disappeared into the night, he turned back and shook his head.</p><p>“Better watch your step, Sammy.”</p><p>With a sense of impending doom, Sam looked around the dark root cellar. Soulless Sam’s parting words had been a warning, no mistaking that but what—</p><p>Through the soles of his feet, he felt vibrations, as if the ground was pulsing. And with that chthonic disturbance, he regained control of his feet. But the moment he shifted his position, the cellar floor began to sink from the center outward, the concrete crumbling to the consistency of gravel—or sand. Even the walls began to slide down, funneling into the widening hole. Sam leapt toward the wooden staircase, falling forward to grab the bottom step with his hands. The ground fell away so quickly it offered him no support. He pulled himself up the stairs far enough to get his knees, and then his feet under him. But without the floor to brace the staircase, it was unable to support his full weight. The tread beneath his feet cracked down the middle, separating from the riser. As he jumped up to the next step, he heard a sharp crack and saw the top tread separating from the front wall. Sam lunged toward the exit—</p><p>—and struck an invisible barrier.</p><p>He pressed his hand against what appeared to be a glass barrier, several inches thick. After pounding his fists against the glass to no effect, he rammed his shoulder against it and almost fell off the teetering staircase. Catching his balance he pressed his back against the transparent barrier and tried to push it out of the way. His gaze dropped to the center of the root cellar where a whirlpool of sand sank into darkness.</p><p>Suddenly the staircase collapsed under him.</p><p>Falling, he flung out an arm and caught the shattered wooden framework, clinging to the wood as if it were a life preserver in the swirling ocean of sand. Soon he was caught in the current, cycling around and down, ever closer to the darkness that would consume him—</p><p>“Whoa!”</p><p>Sam sat up on the motel bed, heart racing as he tried to remember where he was. Middle of the night, but cold light cast from the motel parking lot sliced through a gap in the curtains and split the room in half. On the other side, he saw Dean propped up against his headboard. Too dark to tell if his brother was awake.</p><p>“Dean?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Ribs?”</p><p>“Waiting for the aspirin to kick in.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“Bad dream?”</p><p>“That obvious?”</p><p>“Case of the three a.m. shakes,” Dean said. “Had a doozy myself. Terrifying.”</p><p>“Really?” Sam had the unsettling idea that Dean had witnessed Sam’s dream. Or had the same dream. They’d seen stranger things. “What about?”</p><p>Sam listened with a growing incredulity.</p><p>“...and to top it off,” Dean finished. “I was trapped there with that guy.”</p><p>“That was your terrifying nightmare?” Sam scoffed.</p><p>“All the beer, Sam. In the world. Gone!”</p><p>“Wow.”</p><p>“What? Tell me yours was worse?”</p><p>“No—I—no,” Sam said. Actually, he was relieved that Dean didn’t know what had plagued his subconscious. As it was, Dean thought his brother’s psyche was too fragile. No need to add fuel to that fire. “It was—was fine.”</p><p>Dean’s demeanor changed. He climbed off the bed with a soft grunt of pain, and walked toward Sam, the slice of light momentarily painting a swath of illumination across his concerned expression.</p><p>“Sam, if this is something serious, maybe I oughta know about it.”</p><p>“Look, Dean, I get it. You’re worried about me. But this is... nothing. Really. Nothing at all. Okay, man?”</p><p>“Then tell me.”</p><p>“It was the Mime, all right? I was back in Gillmer’s root cellar.” At least that part was true. “Too close to the clown thing.”</p><p>“Stealth clowns,” Dean said, nodding. “Right.”</p><p>“You don’t sound convinced.”</p><p>“No. I’m convinced. But that don’t mean we should forget you have a wall inside your head keeping a hell storm of memories bottled up.”</p><p>“Dude, do you seriously think I’d forget about the wall in my mind?”</p><p>“No. You’re right. Thing about a scab is, you pick at it.”</p><p>“I’m not picking at anything,” Sam said in exasperation.</p><p>“I was sleeping. Dreaming. That’s normal, right? Something I couldn’t do when my soul was MIA.” Sam took a deep breath. “It’s not like I can control my dreams.”</p><p>Dean thought about it for a moment and nodded. “But, you notice any cracks in the wall, you tell me. Right?”</p><p>“Sure, Dean.”</p><p>In the dim lighting, Sam couldn’t tell if his brother believed him.</p><p>A cell phone rang.</p><p>Dean grabbed his jacket, pulled out his mobile and glanced down at the display.</p><p>“Bobby,” he told Sam and answered the call.</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“You boys up for a drive to Colorado?” Bobby Singer asked in Dean’s ear. Dean punched a button to put him on speaker.</p><p>“Machete Mime’s in our rearview. What’s in Colorado?” he asked.</p><p>“Clayton Falls,” Bobby said. “Giant lizards. Headless horseman. Hit-and-run car with no driver. Definite weirdmeter stuff.”</p><p>Sam got up from his bed to position himself closer to the mic.</p><p>“Mass hallucinations?” he said.</p><p>“Wasn’t no hallucination that run down a kid fresh outta high school,” Bobby responded.</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>“We’ll check it out, Bobby,” Dean said, ending the call. He turned to Sam. “I’ll get coffee. Wanna see what you can find online before we hit the road?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Sure. Wi-Fi hotspot here’s not half bad.” As he opened the laptop and powered it up, he added wistfully, “Now that I can sleep again, I can’t find the time.”</p><p>Dean paused in the doorway on his way out.</p><p>“Sleep’s overrated, right?”</p><p>Several hours later, the sun was up, the coffee was long gone, and Dean was behind the wheel of the Impala, riding I-80 West out of Nebraska. In the passenger seat, Sam had the laptop computer open to review the pages he’d downloaded for offline viewing before they’d left the motel.</p><p>Dean glanced over at him. “Anything?”</p><p>“Not much more than what Bobby gave us.”</p><p>“So Spielberg wasn’t in town filming giant lizards?”</p><p>“Homeless man complained to a beat cop that he was chased by a giant Gila monster.”</p><p>Dean raised an eyebrow. “Homeless guy?”</p><p>“That’s what it says. Gavin Shelburn.”</p><p>“Anyone else see Godzilla?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Maybe chalk that one up to Gavin hitting the sauce a little hard.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Sam said noncommittally. “Steven Bullinger, eighteen, hit-and-run victim. Head trauma. Pronounced dead at the scene. Before he died, Bullinger told a witness the car had no driver.”</p><p>“You did say ‘head trauma?’”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam said, conceding the point. “But... another witness tried to grab the license plate number on the car.”</p><p>“Okay, that one sounds clear-headed.”</p><p>“She says the car disappeared. There one minute, gone the next.”</p><p>Dean tapped the steering wheel. “Phantom car. Okay. What about the headless horseman?”</p><p>“Apparently he chased the daughter of the chief of police. Lucy Quinn.”</p><p>“So we got something.”</p><p>“Something,” Sam agreed. “Dean, I’ve been reading through old articles. Lot of press about a garment factory explosion six months ago. Gas leak. Partial building collapse. Trapped a lot of people. Sprinklers malfunctioned. Those who weren’t killed by the initial explosion and fire died from smoke inhalation.”</p><p>“How many?”</p><p>“Thirty-two dead. All locals,” Sam said. He clicked on another saved page. “Lots of editorials. Worst catastrophe in town history. Human interest stories about each of the victims and their families. Petitions for a memorial. Public debate about the location of the memorial. At the site of the explosion or opposite the town hall. Articles on the bidding and construction. Looks like the town hall location won.”</p><p>“Public grieving,” Dean said. “Think there’s a connection?”</p><p>“It’s something to consider.”</p><p>The Winchesters reached Clayton Falls by early afternoon and, after a brief stop at the Liquor Barn, checked into the StarBrite Motel, their room an instant sixties flashback with framed flower-power prints on the walls, tie-dyed pillowcases, bedside lava lamps, peace sign drawer handles and mirror decals, and a colorful beaded curtain doorway for the closet.</p><p>Clutching a brown paper shopping bag in one arm, Dean took in the rainbow color scheme with a frown.</p><p>“Place looks like they provide LSD tabs instead of complimentary soap,” he said.</p><p>“Might explain some of the weirdness in town,” Sam replied with a shrug.</p><p>Reaching into his Liquor Barn bag, Dean removed three bottles of whiskey and two six-packs of beer, lining them up on the dresser beside the secured television.</p><p>“Planning a bender tonight?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No,” Dean said, determined to avoid any further mention of his evaporating alcohol dream. “This is my... strategic reserve.”</p><p>“Worried about a shortage?”</p><p>“Keeping my options close at hand. Timesaver. That’s all.”</p><p>“All right,” Sam said, smiling as he nodded. But he let it go.</p><p>They changed into their FBI suits and drove to the municipal building to check in with the chief of police. Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” was playing on the local classic rock station when Dean turned off the Impala’s engine.</p><p>They climbed out of the car and crossed the parking lot. The sky was a crisp blue with a staggered line of cottony clouds. To the west, the Rocky Mountains loomed but their edges seemed muted, slightly out of focus.</p><p>“Look,” Sam said and pointed to a curved brick wall, fivefeet high, fifteen-feet wide, with flagpoles at each end, one flying the US flag, the other the state flag of Colorado. The concave front of the wall faced the brick municipal building, with a lofty white clock tower rising from the middle, on the other side of Main Street. “The curved wall’s the memorial. I recognize it from the online photos.”</p><p>They circled around to the front of the memorial. Mounted in the center of the wall was a bronze plaque which listed details about the explosion. On either side of the main plaque were smaller bronze plaques, side by side, with portraits of each of the victims, their names, ages, birth and death dates. The death dates were identical. At the base of the wall fresh bouquets of flowers, along with stuffed animals and framed portraits of the victims or their relatives, filled the open space and spilled out onto the sidewalk.</p><p>“This new every day?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Flowers are fresh.”</p><p>A sign directed them to the police entrance in the back of the municipal building. A short corridor led to a small lobby adjacent to the dispatcher’s elevated area behind bulletproof glass. A gray-haired woman sat on a chair wearing a lightweight headset while she knitted. Next to a microphone in front of her, a nameplate read “Millicent Perkins.”</p><p>Dean tapped the glass to get her attention and flashed his counterfeit FBI credentials.</p><p>“Ms. Perkins,” he said.</p><p>She leaned forward, switched on the microphone.</p><p>“Oh—oh, my! How can I help you?”</p><p>“FBI,” Dean said. “Agents DeYoung and Shaw. We need to see Chief Quinn.”</p><p>“Just a moment. I’ll see if he’s available.”</p><p>She turned to the side, picked up a phone and spoke into it. With the microphone off, her voice was too muffled for him to distinguish individual words.</p><p>Dean looked around. The lobby held some framed newspaper articles highlighting the police department’s activities in the community. A wall-mounted display rack held various informational pamphlets: how parents could recognize drug use in their children, how to form a neighborhood watch, emergency preparedness checklists, and gun safety tips.</p><p>The inner door, beside the dispatcher’s booth buzzed, then opened to reveal a trim man with gray hair in a charcoal-gray police uniform.</p><p>“I’m Chief Quinn,” he said. “You are?”</p><p>Dean flashed his ID again. “Agents DeYoung and Shaw.”</p><p>“Didn’t realize we had a Federal matter here in Clayton Falls.”</p><p>Dean exchanged a glance with Sam, who cleared his throat and said, “Homeland Security. We believe—“</p><p>“That’s quite enough.” Chief Quinn held up his hand to interrupt. “Let’s take this back to my office.”</p><p>Quinn led them down a short hall, past a row of desks with computers, two of which were occupied with uniformed police officers, and stopped at a door with a gold nameplate: “Chief Michael C. Quinn.” He ushered them into his spartan office: law books and police manuals on one bookcase, several framed photos of Quinn at community events or posing with local dignitaries, coat rack in the left rear corner, US flag on a stand in the right.</p><p>Quinn closed his office door and motioned them to the two padded chairs in front of his desk. He sat in the much more comfortable chair behind it.</p><p>The contents of his desk formed an organized triangle, a desk blotter holding a monthly calendar with a Cross pen in the center, a stack of file folders at the right corner, and a high school graduation photo of a young woman with red hair and green eyes to the left. The chief ‘s daughter, Lucy, Dean surmised.</p><p>Chief Quinn leaned forward, forearms angled against the edge of his desk, hands loosely clasped.</p><p>“Apologize for cutting you off out there. Millie isn’t the town gossip, but not for lack of trying. You were about to mention something related to Homeland Security.”</p><p>“We need to question any witnesses to the unusual... events of last night,” Dean said.</p><p>“And read any statements that were taken,” Sam added.</p><p>“As far as I know the only real incident was a hit-and-run fatality,” Quinn said. “Hardly a Homeland Security matter.”</p><p>“We read reports of a giant Gila monster, and a head—“ Sam began.</p><p>Quinn held up a hand. “Let me stop you right there, Agent Shaw. There is no giant Gila monster in Clayton Falls.”</p><p>“Gavin Shelburn...” Sam stopped as the chief ‘s hand came up again.</p><p>“Shelly isn’t the town drunk but—“</p><p>“Not for lack of trying?” Dean finished.</p><p>“Exactly,” Quinn said, not taking offense. “Nobody else saw such a thing. How far is it from pink elephants to giant lizards? One bottle or two?”</p><p>“Lucy Quinn, your own daughter, reported being chased by a headless horseman.”</p><p>“My daughter...” Quinn sighed. Leaned back in his chair and stared off into space for a few moments before he spoke again. “Lucy is an only child. She came to my wife and me later in life. A surprise. Pleasant one, mind you, but we never thought...” He cleared his throat. “Lost my wife to breast cancer when Lucy was five. That was hard on Lucy, hard on both of us. Don’t think you can come out of something like that unchanged.” He picked up the Cross pen and tapped it against the paper of the calendar. “Then, last year, Lucy lost someone else close to her. What I’m trying to say is... I don’t think Lucy would intentionally lie about this, but...”</p><p>“What? You think she imagined it?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I’m not so foolish to think that she might not experiment... that she might have been involved in something she’d rather not tell her old man about.”</p><p>“Headless horseman’s one hell of a cover story,” Sam said.</p><p>“The boy who was killed by that driver ran out into the middle of the street and stopped there,” Quinn said. “He’d been with Lucy and another boy in Founders Park. I know for a fact that drinking was involved. We certainly found enough beer cans out there. Possibly drugs.”</p><p>“A witness said the car disappeared,” Dean said.</p><p>“Witnesses are, as a rule, unreliable,” Quinn said. “No surprise to a couple Feds, I’m sure. All of which brings me back to my first question. What’s the connection to Homeland Security?”</p><p>“We don’t want to alarm you or the citizens of Clayton Falls,” Sam said. “We know this town has been through a lot.”</p><p>“The factory fire,” Quinn said, nodding. “Many residents lost someone, or know someone who did. Hell of a thing.”</p><p>Sam cleared his throat, about to launch into their cover story. “We have information from credible sources indicating a terrorist cell might be testing a weaponized airborne hallucinogen here.”</p><p>“Weaponized airborne hallucinogen? In Clayton Falls? Why?”</p><p>“Small population, out of the way location, easy to monitor results,” Dean said with a shrug.</p><p>“Obviously, we don’t think Clayton Falls is the ultimate target,” Sam said. “Their ultimate objective would be a large metropolitan area.”</p><p>“And how, may I ask, did you come by this information?”</p><p>The chief looked startled, as though uncertain how to react to the information.</p><p>“Most of the details are highly classified, but...” Sam said and paused for a moment, as if debating how much to tell the local police chief. This was also part of the plan. “What I tell you must be handled with the utmost discretion.”</p><p>Quinn leaned forward and nodded. “Of course.”</p><p>“We’re relying on some ECHELON chatter and reports from some deep-cover operatives.”</p><p>The chief nodded and leaned back in his chair.</p><p>“I’m convinced you’re convinced,” he said and cleared his throat. “But I’m a skeptic at heart.”</p><p>Sam reached into his suit pocket and produced a credible facsimile of an FBI business card and pushed it across the desk.</p><p>“Our supervisor, Agent Tom Willis, working out of the St. Louis field office, can clear up any jurisdictional concerns,” he said. “Possibly provide you with more detailed threat assessment information than we’re authorized to reveal.”</p><p>Quinn picked up the business card and examined it for a long moment with one eyebrow arched before sliding it into a shirt pocket.</p><p>“Thank you. I’ll take that under advisement.” He stood abruptly; Dean and Sam rose with him. “Regardless, I see no reason why you can’t read the statements or interview witnesses.”</p><p>Dean glanced meaningfully at the photo of Quinn’s daughter. “Even...?”</p><p>“Legally, she’s an adult,” Quinn said. “Might do her good to learn the... consequences of this type of report.”</p><p>He shook hands with both of them.</p><p>“I do have one reservation.”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“This is a quiet town,” Quinn said. “I’d like to keep it that way. Wasn’t always like this though. As I’m sure you’re aware, Falls Federal Prison is just outside the town limits. Couple of years ago, they added a supermax wing. Worst of the worst locked up in there. Had folks in town jumpy as frogs on a hot skillet. Protests, picketing, demonstrations—and not always peaceful. Time passed. Falls remained secure. Life goes on.</p><p>That’s where we are now. Peaceful, quiet, and orderly. What concerns me is that talk of a terrorist attack here could cause a panic.”</p><p>“Understood,” Dean said.</p><p>“But if we’re right, Chief Quinn,” Sam added, his deep voice serious, “this could turn dangerous.”</p><p>“Noted. Keep me informed.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Chief Quinn opened the door and looked out into the bullpen area. Only one uniformed cop remained along the row of desks: mid-twenties, buzz cut, earnest.</p><p>“Jeffries. Give these FBI agents—DeYoung and Shaw— copies of the witness statements from last night.”</p><p>“Everything, Chief?”</p><p>“Warts and all.”</p><p>“Yes, sir. Oh, and Lucy’s...?”</p><p>“Everything, Jeffries.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Well, that’s everything,” Officer Richard Jeffries said, dumping the stack of folders on the edge of his desk. “Sorry it took so long. Copier jammed. Office assistant usually takes care of this stuff, but she only works mornings. Budget cutbacks, you know.”</p><p>Dean picked up the pile of folders, itching to get out of the building.</p><p>Jeffries hooked his thumbs in his belt. “You’re taking all of this seriously?”</p><p>“Very seriously,” Sam said. “Why?”</p><p>“Even Shelly’s giant lizard?”</p><p>“No stone unturned,” Dean said.</p><p>“You hear stories about people dumping pet alligators down the sewer and they supposedly grow down there to full size. Live off rats. But that stuff ‘s urban legend, right?”</p><p>“One of the great mysteries,” Dean said.</p><p>“Think somebody dumped a Gila monster down the sewer?”</p><p>“You never know,” Sam said. “Are you familiar with these reports?”</p><p>“Read them all. For entertainment value, sure beats traffic citations.”</p><p>“Impressions?”</p><p>“Hard to take them seriously,” Jeffries said and shrugged.</p><p>“Well, except for the hit and run. Bullinger stood in the middle of the road. Driver of the car should have seen him, but... who knows? We’re looking for a red car. Don’t know make and model. Not even a partial on the plate. Not much to go on, really.”</p><p>“What about Lucy Quinn’s statement?” Dean asked.</p><p>Jeffries hesitated, glancing at the police chief ‘s office, perhaps unwilling to speak negatively about his boss’s daughter.</p><p>“Sticking with her story. Stubborn, like the chief. She was hanging out with Tony Lacosta, who backed up her story. Bullinger was with them earlier. Obviously we never got his statement. But, really, a headless horseman?” He shrugged again. “My first thought was—“ he glanced toward the police chief ‘s door again and lowered his voice—“controlled substances.”</p><p>“Thanks for your help,” Sam said. “Anything weird happens, keep us in the loop. We oughta get going.”</p><p>“Sure. Right. Didn’t mean to hold you up.”</p><p>As they walked back toward the lobby, Jeffries called after them.</p><p>“You need anything, let me know.”</p><p>“Will do,” Dean said, waving an arm without looking back.</p><p>He exchanged a glance with Sam. “Won’t be stumbling over any police follow-up.”</p><p>“Not anytime soon.”</p><p>Minutes after Dean drove from the municipal parking lot, Sam’s phone rang.</p><p>“Bobby,” Sam said and put the call on speaker.</p><p>“You jokers put Guinness on speed dial?” Bobby said. “In town less than an hour and already you got somebody checking up on you.”</p><p>“Chief Quinn rang the bat phone?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Of course, ya idjit,” Bobby snapped. “Who else would I be flapping about?”</p><p>“Just saying,” Dean replied. “That man has a distrustful soul.”</p><p>“And whatever you two were selling in there,” Bobby continued, “he ain’t exactly inclined to rush to the checkout lane.”</p><p>“But...?” Sam said.</p><p>“What I gather, he’s willing to play out enough rope for you two to hang yourselves.”</p><p>“Well, that’s encouraging.”</p><p>“My advice,” Bobby said, “don’t go too far off the reservation on this one. Or expect a guided tour of county lockup.”</p><p>“Right,” Sam said. “Low profile.”</p><p>“Bobby,” Dean said. “Any luck with the phoenix ash situation?”</p><p>“Besides their place of honor on my mantel?” Bobby said. “Fat lotta good they are when I can’t find hide nor hair of Eve, Mother of All.”</p><p>“Something will turn up,” Sam said.</p><p>“Ain’t you the Pollyanna,” Bobby said and ended the call.</p><p>Sam looked a question at Dean.</p><p>“What? Keeps his mind off Rufus.”</p><p>“Considering one of Eve’s creatures was responsible for Rufus’ death,” Sam said, “not sure that will do the trick.”</p><p>“It’s Bobby. What’s he gonna do? Look the other way?” Dean asked. “Besides, I’d prefer directed anger over grief any day.”</p><p>He parked the Impala on Welker Street near the Mandarin Palace restaurant. He and Sam walked along the side of the restaurant and turned down the alley that ran behind a bunch of storefronts in the business district of Clayton Falls between Welker and Bell Street.</p><p>“Here?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “According to the report.”</p><p>After looking for Gavin Shelburn to no avail at the local homeless shelter, food bank, and soup kitchen—housed in two adjoining buildings—they had decided to visit the site of the alleged giant Gila monster attack.</p><p>“Police never bothered to check the scene,” Sam said. “Figured Shelburn had one too many.”</p><p>“Let’s say Shelburn wasn’t hallucinating. What are we looking for exactly? People around here would notice a giant lizard.”</p><p>“Yeah, but they might not notice this.”</p><p>Sam crouched beside a battered Dumpster with a missing front wheel.</p><p>Dean stood over his shoulder. “Banged-up Dumpster?”</p><p>“Banged up and...” Sam traced his fingers along two sets of deep parallel grooves that scored the blue paint of the trash bin. “...scratched. Dean, Shelburn said he jumped into a Dumpster to escape.”</p><p>Dean nodded, lifted the lid of the trash bin.</p><p>“Score marks on the edge,” he pointed out.</p><p>“Busted that wheel off, too,” a voice said from behind them.</p><p>They turned to face a grizzled man in a misshapen fedora, creased overcoat, threadbare jeans and battered combat boots standing at the entrance to the alley. He kept his distance from them, a wary look in his eyes, as if he would never again trust what he saw.</p><p>“Gavin Shelburn?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Shelly’s fine,” the man said, making no effort to approach them. “You with the government?”</p><p>“FBI,” Dean said. “Okay if we ask you a few questions, Shelly?”</p><p>“I’m not crazy,” he said.</p><p>“Good to know.”</p><p>“It happened right here. Quinn’s boys think I’m nuts. But I ain’t nuts. Sure, I drink. Who doesn’t? But I see what I see... at least I...” He stuffed his hands in his overcoat pockets. “It was a Gila monster attacked me. But big. Size of two cars back to back! I know that ain’t right. But I can’t explain it.”</p><p>“Did you see where it came from?” Dean asked.</p><p>Shelburn shook his head. “I was walking back from Joe’s Pizza Shack and I heard it. Heard something. Turned around and there it was. Chased me. I ducked in here and, well, jumped in there. Guess you could say Dumpster diving saved my life.”</p><p>Sam pointed at the scratch marks. “Then it attacked the Dumpster?”</p><p>“Yep,” Shelburn said, finally coming a few steps closer. He walked along the brick wall and showed them scrape marks at Dumpster height. “Pushed it, slammed into it, then tried to climb inside after me. That’s when the wheel busted off, under its weight, I guess.”</p><p>“But it gave up and left?” Sam asked.</p><p>“That’s the weird thing. It never walked—crawled away. I would’ve heard that, with its claws scraping the ground and that tail thumping everything in sight. But nope. Nothing. One minute it was there, the next it was gone.”</p><p>“Anything else you remember?”</p><p>“Seemed mighty hungry.”</p><p>“Right,” Sam said with a slight smile. “Thanks for your help.”</p><p>“You know what caused it?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said. “We’re here to find out.”</p><p>“Bet it was radiation,” Shelburn said. “Or toxic chemicals. Illegal dumping. Or... some top-secret government experiment? Is that it?” He backed up a few steps. “That why they sent you FBI types to Clayton Falls? A cover-up? They send you to kill all the witnesses?”</p><p>“Whoa! Nothing like that,” Dean said. Batting a thousand, he thought. First witness already panicking. “The ‘I’ is for investigation.”</p><p>Shelburn nodded slowly, as if trying to convince himself, calm himself.</p><p>“Okay, all right. I’m not a conspiracy nut. Never was. But you see a giant Gila monster and you start to rethink everything, right? Down is up; up is down.”</p><p>“You might want to steer clear of this alley,” Sam suggested.</p><p>“You believe me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Shelburn said, suddenly smiling broadly. “I may be down on my luck, but I ain’t crazy.” He doffed his hat and extended it in his arm. “Wouldn’t mind a donation...”</p><p>Sam smiled.</p><p>Dean reached into a pocket, peeled off a twenty and dropped it in the hat.</p><p>“Mighty generous of you,” he said, tucking the bill into a pocket. “I’ll take your advice as well and clear out.”</p><p>“Wait a minute,” Sam said. “You’re out most nights?”</p><p>“About every night. Why?”</p><p>“Wait here,” Sam said. He walked to the Impala and returned with a pair of two-way radios from the trunk, handing one to Shelly. “You know how to use these?” The man nodded. “Keep it on channel five. You spot anything weird, out of the usual, call me.”</p><p>“You deputizing me?”</p><p>“Think of it as neighborhood watch activity.”</p><p>They spent a moment checking the battery levels, sending and receiving messages. Shelly adjusted the volume on his unit and nodded, satisfied, and stuffed it in his pocket. “Anything weird or unusual. Got it.”</p><p>“Don’t put yourself at risk,” Sam said. “Just call it in.”</p><p>“No worries on that account.”</p><p>As Shelly sauntered off, Dean shook his head at Sam.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Dude, you realize that radio’s headed for the nearest pawn shop.”</p><p>“Not like I gave him the pair.”</p><p>Shelly paused at the entrance to the alley and looked back at them.</p><p>“Remembered one other thing,” he called. “White mist, clinging to the ground. Noticed it right before the beast attacked.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Blake Dobkins, marketing manager at an organic food company located in an industrial park at the south end of Clayton Falls, met Dean in the lobby and led him to a conference room where they could speak in private.</p><p>“Not much to tell, Agent DeYoung,” Dobkins said. “My wife and I were out celebrating our fifth anniversary at this Italian place where we had our first date. Actually, we were leaving the restaurant to go home, when I saw the speeding car hit that young man in the middle of the street.”</p><p>“Police report said the car was red. Any other details?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not really a car enthusiast,” Dobkins said apologetically. “It was an older car. Maybe one of those muscle cars from the sixties or seventies. Gone before I had a good look at it.”</p><p>“Nothing unusual about it? Spoiler? Fancy hubcaps? Tinted glass? Anything?” Dean pressed.</p><p>Dobkins shook his head, almost a reflexive gesture. But then he closed his eyes. Dean waited, resisting the urge to drum his fingers on the shiny surface of the conference room table. He could imagine Dobkins trying to visualize those brief seconds as the car sped up to Bullinger, struck him, and raced away from the scene.</p><p>“White,” Dobkins said at last, opening his eyes and nodding. “A streak of white.”</p><p>“But you said the car was red.”</p><p>“Yes, it was,” Dobkins said, “but it had a wide line—a racing stripe—on the hood. That was white. My eyes tracked the boy when the car struck him. Everything happened so fast, but yes, I remember a streak of white on the driver’s side of the hood.”</p><p>“Good,” Dean said, trying to sound encouraging. “That could help us find the car.” Assuming the car was real and had a human driver. “What happened after Bullinger was hit?”</p><p>“I ran into the street, to see if he was okay, but I... when I got up close... it looked bad. I called for an ambulance, but...”</p><p>“Before he died, Bullinger spoke to you?”</p><p>“He said nobody was driving. Didn’t make sense, but considering his condition, I wasn’t surprised.”</p><p>“Were those his exact words?”</p><p>“He said, ‘nobody driving.’ That’s all I heard.”</p><p>Sam flashed his FBI credentials at the front door of the Clayton Falls Child Care Center and was buzzed in by a middle-aged woman with frizzy brown hair and a distracted demeanor. She introduced herself as Mary Horton, the manager. She wore a white smock with dozens of colorful giraffe silhouettes dotted across it. They stood in the middle of a spacious room with scattered activity centers for children, including a mini puppet show theater, art supplies and easels, a stocked bookcase, jigsaw puzzles, blocks and bins filled with toys and action figures. All the tables and chairs were scaled down for children, but the room was empty. Judging from the commotion Sam heard out back, they were all enjoying the playground equipment.</p><p>“Oh, no! This isn’t about a kidnapping, is it?” Mary Horton said, eyebrows dancing with concern.</p><p>“No, Ms. Horton,” Sam said. “I’m here to talk to Linda Dobkins.”</p><p>“She’s not in any sort of trouble, is she?”</p><p>“I have a few questions about an accident she witnessed.”</p><p>“Oh, yes, she told me about that. Horrible. Who could do such a thing?”</p><p>“That’s what we’re trying to figure out.”</p><p>“Wait here. I’ll get her,” she said. “One of us has to stay with the children at all times.”</p><p>Sam followed her to the back door and waited there in the relative silence.</p><p>Mary talked to a younger woman with a blond ponytail wearing a white smock with monkey silhouettes over faded jeans and sneakers. Compared to the chaotic appearance of her boss, Linda Dobkins seemed almost serene in the middle of the childhood frenzy whirling around her, kids racing from sliding boards to swings to seesaws and back again. Linda nodded, brushed her hands on her jeans and came in through the back door.</p><p>She offered her hand. “Agent... Shaw, right?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Well, you know who I am, obviously,” she said, flashing a smile. “Of course, I want to help, but I’m afraid I told the police everything I saw. Or, rather, didn’t see.”</p><p>“The disappearing car.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Crazy as that sounds.”</p><p>“Tell me everything you saw, from beginning to end.”</p><p>“We—my husband and I—were leaving the restaurant. I heard the roar of the car’s engine. I swear the car accelerated. Like the driver was trying to hit that boy. It was a split second, a flash of motion, then the impact. I was shocked, stunned, but Blake ran out there to help. No hesitation. I tried to get a look at the driver, but the car was already past me, so I tried to catch the license plate number. Even part of it. I’ve seen television shows where a few digits are enough to find a car.”</p><p>“Did you see any digits?”</p><p>“No,” she said and frowned. “I mean, it was a second or two at most. Before my eyes could focus on the license plate, the car vanished.”</p><p>“You’re sure about that?”</p><p>Sam noticed several of the children had become curious about his presence, pressing their faces against the glass door for a better look. One girl, about five years old, waved at him. A boy not much older stuck out his tongue. Mary Horton took notice, rushed up and shooed them away from the door.</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure,” Linda said. “The car started to turn the corner. I was losing my angle on the license plate and then it was like it... winked out of existence. Blake thinks I must have looked away, distracted by the injured boy, but I never took my eyes off the car from the time I tried to catch the license number.”</p><p>“Could another vehicle have passed between you and the car?”</p><p>“No,” she said. “Traffic was light. No other cars or trucks passed by during the few seconds before, during, and after the accident.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“You think I’m crazy, don’t you?”</p><p>“For what it’s worth,” Sam said. “I don’t.”</p><p>Timing was everything. Dean managed to snag a corner booth in C.J.’s Diner before the sizable dinner crowd rolled in. Considering how popular the place was, he had high hopes for the quality of his ordered cheeseburger and fries. Sam arrived at the tail end of the rush, spotted Dean from across the crowded restaurant and joined him.</p><p>“Quiet little place?” he said.</p><p>“Until about ten minutes ago,” Dean replied. “Who knew?”</p><p>Their energetic waitress—Betsy, according to her nametag—arrived with two identical plates, smiling broadly as she placed them down on the Formica table.</p><p>“Careful, boys,” she said amiably. “Food’s hot and so are the plates.”</p><p>Dean nodded at the food.</p><p>“Kept it simple. Ordered two of everything.”</p><p>“Which, if I don’t eat, gives you two of everything?”</p><p>“C’mon,” Dean said. “It’s a burger. Won’t kill you. Look, she put lettuce on it.”</p><p>After a moment, Sam shrugged. “Fine. But next time, I order.”</p><p>Betsy put her hands on her hips, her smile maintaining its high wattage, as if she were the chairperson of the Clayton Falls welcoming committee. She certainly looked official in her server uniform, white blouse and black slacks topped by a navy blue vest with four red buttons and “C.J.’s” embroidered in gold thread script opposite her nametag.</p><p>“You’re them FBI agents. Am I right?”</p><p>“How did you know?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Bit overdressed for this place,” she said. “Plus, word gets around.”</p><p>In the next booth, an elderly man with a few days’ growth of stubble laughed.</p><p>“Let them eat before their food gets cold, Betsy. And I’m still waiting on my onion rings.”</p><p>“Oh, you’ll get your onion rings, Phil Meyerson,” she said. “But if you want them now, you’ll eat them raw.”</p><p>“What’s taking so long?”</p><p>“Put the order in two minutes ago,” she said. “You’re retired, Phil. Relax.”</p><p>“Not in my nature.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, dear,” she said. “Any super viruses come along, we’ll kill them in our deep fryer.”</p><p>Dean and Sam exchanged a look.</p><p>“Super viruses?” Dean asked. He looked down at his half-eaten cheeseburger and fries then back up at Betsy. “Anything I should know?”</p><p>“Oh, nothing,” she said with a dismissive wave of her hand. “Phil worked at the C.D.C. in Atlanta. Don’t think he brought anything contagious with him.”</p><p>“Phil?” Sam said.</p><p>Dean could see the wheels turning.</p><p>“Microbiologist,” Meyerson said. “Retired seven years ago. Only contagious thing I’ve had since then was a nasty head cold. Now, look at this. My coffee cup is empty.”</p><p>“Relax, Phil,” Betsy said. “I can take a hint.”</p><p>Before she turned away, Dean said, “We were hoping to talk to Lucy Quinn. Said to meet her here.”</p><p>“Oh, right! Girl said she had to hang around.”</p><p>“Hang around?”</p><p>“Shift ended a few minutes ago,” Betsy said. “She’s in the break room. I’ll send her out.”</p><p>After Betsy left for a coffee pot, Meyerson slid out of his booth and headed toward the restroom. Dean took the opportunity to compare notes with Sam.</p><p>“Anything new from Linda?”</p><p>Sam finished a fry, and shook his head.</p><p>“Nothing that wasn’t in the police report.”</p><p>“What are we looking at here? After the possessed love doll thing in Jersey, I’m keeping the Impala far away from any vengeful spirits.”</p><p>Through the front window, Dean saw an ambulance roll into the diner’s lot and stop behind a row of cars without pulling into a parking slot.</p><p>“Linda said the car vanished. I believe her.”</p><p>“Meaning?”</p><p>“Not a vengeful spirit.”</p><p>“Poltergeist? Some kind of haunting?”</p><p>“I don’t know, Dean,” Sam said. “Headless horseman, giant lizard, phantom car. Not seeing a common thread. What about the husband?”</p><p>“Remembered the red car had a white stripe on the hood,” Dean said. “Otherwise, no revelations.”</p><p>A rail-thin EMT entered the diner and walked over to the counter under a “Pick Up” sign dangling from two chains made out of interlocked paper clips. He drummed his fingers impatiently on the countertop and looked around with quick darting motions.</p><p>Hummingbird metabolism, Dean thought. Or an addiction to amphetamines. A waitress in her fifties working behind the counter brought him a grease-stained bag and a large coffee.</p><p>As the EMT paid for his order, a young woman with red hair came through a gap in the counter and spoke to him briefly, patting his arm. She looked around the diner until she saw Dean and Sam and made a beeline for their booth. She wore a cropped denim jacket, a black T-shirt and jeans, with a lime-green canvas bag slung over one shoulder. Dean saw the edge of a blue C.J.’s vest poking out of the bag.</p><p>“Agent DeYoung?” she said, guessing right. She offered her hand. “Lucy Quinn.”</p><p>Dean stood, shook her hand.</p><p>“This is my partner, Agent Shaw.”</p><p>She turned to Sam, repeated the gesture.</p><p>“Scooch over,” she said to Sam, who obliged. She sat next to him and snatched one of his fries. “Not really supposed to hang around after my shift, but I’m sure my boss will make an exception for the FBI.”</p><p>On his way out to the double-parked ambulance, the wiry EMT called over to her, “Bye, Lucy.”</p><p>“Later, Roman!” She waved at him.</p><p>“Friend of yours?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Neighbor,” she said. “Roman Messerly. Babysat me years ago, when my dad took my mom to her chemo... Anyway, he’s kind of like the older brother I never had. Worry about him. That job is all wrong for him. Way too stressful. Jeez, I’m rambling.” She clasped her hands together and sat up straight, as if practicing good posture. “Sorry. Nerves.”</p><p>“We have a few questions,” Dean said. “About the horseman.”</p><p>“My dad warned me,” she said, then quickly added, “I mean, he told me you’d ask about what I saw. I asked Tony to meet us here—‘cause he saw it too—but he’s a no-show. Time challenged. So, questions?”</p><p>“You were in the park—“ Sam said.</p><p>“Yep. Founders Park. By the monument. Just hanging out, minding our own business.”</p><p>“And the headless horseman appeared out of nowhere?”</p><p>She nodded. “I was facing the statues. The town founders. They’re both on horses. So, two horses. Next thing I know, I see three horses. But the third horse and rider are moving, and they come around the monument and start chasing us.”</p><p>“And the rider had no head? You’re sure.”</p><p>“Definitely! He was dressed in black head to toe—well, neck to toe—but there was no head attached to the body.”</p><p>“Maybe his face was hidden,” Dean suggested. “A dark mask?”</p><p>“Nope. His neck was all ragged and... blood-crusted, like whoever lopped off his head took several whacks to finish the job.”</p><p>“And he came after you?”</p><p>“All of us or... I don’t know, maybe one of us was the target, but we ran away together and he charged us with a sword. Until...”</p><p>“What?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We split up,” she said slowly. “Tony pulled me to one side. Steve kept running straight ahead. The horseman followed Steve, not us. We were so scared. We kept running through the park until we came out on the north side, and headed home. Later, we called Steve but got no answer on his cell. He never made it home. My dad called me after he found out about the hit and run, to make sure I was okay.” She took a deep breath. “That... thing chased Steve into traffic. It’s the reason he was killed.”</p><p>“Did you notice anything unusual before the horseman appeared?”</p><p>“No. It appeared out of nowhere...” She paused. “Oh, wait. There was some kind of white ground mist. I noticed that first when Steve dropped his... What? Why are you guys staring at each other like that?”</p><p>“Second time somebody mentioned white mist before seeing something... weird,” Sam said.</p><p>“So, that’s significant, right?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Sam said. “Have to ask. Any illegal substances involved while you were hanging out in the park?”</p><p>“Drugs? No!” she said defensively. “Steve swiped some beer from home, but I didn’t have any. Wasn’t in the mood. I was thinking about...” She shook her head, as if she was mentally shifting gears. “I was sober. Completely.”</p><p>“Your father tell you the car that hit Steve vanished?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No,” she said. “He said it was a hit and run. Steve was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Vanished how?”</p><p>“Into thin air,” Sam said. “According to a witness.”</p><p>“What’s going on?” she asked. “Things appearing and disappearing.” She leaned forward and whispered. “My father said you guys think a terrorist is testing a hallucinogen.”</p><p>Dean tried to hide his surprise.</p><p>“He told you that?”</p><p>“Yep,” she said, still hushed. “He’s all about total communication with his daughter. Figures I’ll reciprocate.” She shrugged. “But he sounded skeptical.”</p><p>“We got that,” Sam said.</p><p>“Whatever it is, you think the car is connected to the headless horseman?”</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>“But what do they have in common? Anything weird about the car?”</p><p>“Before he died, Steve said the car had no driver.”</p><p>“Hadn’t heard that either,” Lucy said somberly. “Horseman without a head. Car without a driver.”</p><p>“Otherwise, it seemed like a normal red car.”</p><p>Dean added, “With a white stripe on the hood.”</p><p>Lucy grabbed Dean’s wrist, her green eyes widening.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Red car with a white stripe,” he repeated.</p><p>Her grip tightened.</p><p>“Oh, my God! What—what kind of car?”</p><p>“Is that important?”</p><p>“What kind?”</p><p>“Older model,” Dean said. “Muscle car. Sixties or seventies. That’s all we know.”</p><p>“Could it have been—? No, that’s not possible. It’s crazy.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“A ‘68 Dodge Charger?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean said. “Why? Have you seen it?”</p><p>Lucy released Dean’s wrist. She glanced down at the table, nibbled on the edge of her thumbnail. When she spoke again, her voice was so soft Dean had to strain to hear her words.</p><p>“That was Teddy’s car.”</p><p>Before Dean could ask about Teddy, she slipped out of the booth, rushed across the diner and out the door without looking back.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What just happened?” Sam said.</p><p>Dean stood, removed thirty dollars from his wallet and slapped it on the table. He glanced wistfully at his halfeaten meal.</p><p>“Damn,” he said, “That cheeseburger was good.”</p><p>They found her in the parking lot, pacing behind a row of cars, still nibbling at the edge of her thumbnail. Dean had the impression she wanted to run away but was fighting the urge. He looked sideways at Sam, who shrugged.</p><p>“Lucy?” he called. “Everything okay?”</p><p>“Fine,” she said, her voice pitched higher than usual. “I’m—it’s fine. It’s insane, right? Can’t be Teddy’s car.”</p><p>“Teddy?” Dean said.</p><p>“Teodor Kucharski,” she said. “He is—was my boyfriend.”</p><p>“Let us talk to him.”</p><p>“You can’t,” she said. “He’s dead. He died a year ago.”</p><p>“Sorry. I...”</p><p>“It’s okay. I’m fine.”</p><p>Cleary, she wasn’t fine. Dean looked at Sam and whispered, “Vengeful spirit?”</p><p>Again Sam shrugged.</p><p>“The car,” Dean said, taking a few steps closer to her. “Who has it now?”</p><p>“That’s the thing,” she said, finally making eye contact. Her eyes were red, her cheeks moist. She’d been quietly crying since she hurried out of the diner. “Teddy was driving his ‘68 Dodge Charger the night he died. The car was totaled. So, this... vanishing car couldn’t be his. Could it?”</p><p>“Don’t know,” Dean said. “Maybe somebody fixed it.”</p><p>She shook her head. “I was in that car when it crashed. We all were.”</p><p>“We who?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Teddy, Steve, Tony, and me,” she said. “I broke my arm against the dash. Tony broke both legs. Steve needed surgery on his hip. I managed to climb out the passenger window. They needed the Jaws of Life to get Tony and Steve out. But... Teddy... he got the worst of it. Steering column crushed his chest.”</p><p>“That’s horrible,” Dean said.</p><p>“It was stupid,” she said. “We were all stupid. Drinking. We let Teddy drive. He loved that car, inherited from his dad. Washed and waxed it every week. Kept it spotless. Nobody else could drive it. Ever. That night... well, it was the same as always, except we’d all been drinking. Goofing off. None of us should have gotten behind the wheel. But Teddy... It was always Teddy. I have nightmares about the accident. All the time. I wake up as if I’m about to go through the windshield. Sometimes I wake up screaming.” She wrapped her arms tight around herself, shuddered and shook her head. “So believe me, that car was totaled.”</p><p>“Listen,” Sam said. “It’s getting dark. Let us give you a ride home.”</p><p>“Take me to Tony’s house,” she said, wiping away a fresh tear. “You should talk to him about the headless horseman. He can confirm what I saw.”</p><p>She’d already put herself through an emotion wringer. Dean had no desire to make it worse. Not like they needed her to make introductions. “That’s okay. Just give us his address.”</p><p>“No,” she said quickly. “It’s fine. I want you guys to figure this out before I start thinking I really am nuts. Besides, Tony lives a couple blocks from me. I can walk home from his place.”</p><p>“Sounds like a plan,” Dean said.</p><p>A silver Lexus pulled into the diner’s lot and parked in a spot close to where the trio was walking towards the Impala. Before they could walk around the car, a tall middle-aged man in a charcoal-gray pinstriped suit, with more salt than pepper in his hair, climbed out of the car and placed a hand protectively on Lucy’s shoulder. Though he spoke to her, his suspicious gaze lingered on Dean and Sam.</p><p>“Lucy,” he said. “Everything all right here?”</p><p>“Fine, Uncle Alden,” she said, smiling at him. “These men are with the FBI.”</p><p>“Agent DeYoung,” Dean said, resisting the urge to pull out his fake ID.</p><p>“Agent Shaw,” Sam said with a slight nod.</p><p>Uncle Alden raised an eyebrow. “FBI?”</p><p>Maybe that was an ID-flashing moment after all, Dean thought.</p><p>“It’s cool, Uncle Alden,” Lucy said. “They’ve already talked to Dad.”</p><p>“I see,” he said, nodding without surrendering his suspicions yet. He held her chin and tilted her face up. “You’ve been crying.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she said. “Talking about Teddy. That’s all.” She cleared her throat. “Agents, this is Alden Webb. Friend of my father. He’s the warden at Falls Federal Prison.”</p><p>Webb offered his hand, shook each of theirs.</p><p>“Chief Quinn spoke of resentment in town about the prison,” Sam offered.</p><p>“There was some... concern when we opened the supermax wing. But that’s in the past,” Webb said. “The town and the prison have reached... an accommodation. They know the prison is here to stay but the inmates—especially those in supermax—represent no threat to Clayton Falls. There’s a peaceful coexistence.”</p><p>“Anyway, Uncle Alden, the agents were about to drive me home,” Lucy said. “So, enjoy your meal. And I’ll see you later.”</p><p>“Certainly,” Webb said, nodding to them. He gave Lucy a quick hug and a peck on the cheek. “Take good care of this one, gentlemen.”</p><p>“You bet,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean nodded and, after Webb entered the diner, led the way to the Impala. As they climbed into the car, Dean asked Sam, “You get the feeling he’d like to toss us in a cell?”</p><p>“Don’t take it personally,” Lucy said, chuckling. “He’s suspicious of everyone. Says it’s part of his job description.”</p><p>She directed them to Tony Lacosta’s house, which was a little over a mile away from the diner.</p><p>“Right there,” she said. “Yellow siding, white trim and posts.”</p><p>“Got it,” Dean said and pulled in at the curb. The house had a covered front porch with a white railing three steps up from the ground. Behind a few small shrubs, he spotted a latticed porch skirt. He flashed back on the image of the young woman’s body they’d discovered under the Machete Mime’s farmhouse.</p><p>“There he is.” Lucy led the way up wooden steps to the porch.</p><p>Tony Lacosta sat on the first of two white Adirondack chairs, asleep with his crossed feet propped up on the porch railing. When Lucy unceremoniously knocked his feet down, he jolted awake and jumped out of the chair.</p><p>“What the hell!? Lucy?”</p><p>“Are you stoned?” she asked.</p><p>“No,” he said quickly. “Yeah. Maybe. Had a few brews. Who’s asking?” He glanced at Dean and Sam in their FBI suits and leaned closer to Lucy before whispering loud enough for all three of them to hear. “Jeez, Luce. Narcing on me with the FBI guys?”</p><p>Lucy punched his upper arm.</p><p>“I asked you to meet me at the diner!”</p><p>“Oh, right. Damn, I forgot.”</p><p>“Forgot? I called less than an hour ago!” She shook her head in disappointment. “You’re such a jackass.”</p><p>“Don’t be a bitch,” Tony said. “Besides, what’s it matter? I saw the same thing you saw.”</p><p>“That’s the point!” Lucy said, exasperated. “Everyone thinks I’m crazy. I thought you had my back.”</p><p>“I do,” Tony said, chagrined. “I saved your ass in the park, didn’t I?”</p><p>Lucy sighed, dropped down in his chair while he stood looking down at her.</p><p>“Yes. I was an idiot. That thing would have lopped off my head if you didn’t drag me out of there. Sorry, Tone.”</p><p>“Apology accepted,” he slouched against the wooden post beside the stairs. “Sorry about not meeting you.”</p><p>“Okay. So tell Agent DeYoung and Shaw what we saw.”</p><p>“DeYoung and Shaw, huh? Like a Styx reunion.” When he got no reaction to his quip from Lucy, he continued. “Fine,” he said, focusing on Dean and Sam at last. “Lucy’s right. This sounds crazy. But it happened...” He told them his version of the headless horseman story, which basically matched Lucy’s with the significant exception that his back was turned when the horseman supposedly appeared out of nowhere. “When I turned around it was already there. Freaky as hell. Looked like it was out for blood, so we bolted.” The rest of his account matched Lucy’s and offered no additional information.</p><p>“Any idea why the horseman continued after your friend?” Sam asked. “Instead of you two?”</p><p>Tony shook his head. “Totally random. When I pulled Lucy with me, I guess I forced him—it—to make a decision. Maybe it knew it couldn’t chase all of us if we split up.” He shrugged. “Could have come after us. Steve kept running straight ahead. Thing didn’t have a head. No eyes. Maybe it was easier to keep riding straight.” He shook his head, ran his hand through his dark hair. “Hey, you guys want a beer or something?”</p><p>Dean thought a beer sounded like an excellent idea, but they had to keep up their cover. Especially since they would be hanging around Clayton Falls for the foreseeable future.</p><p>“I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that,” he said. “But thanks for your help. Both of you.”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>“Thanks for the ride,” Lucy said. “I’ll hang here for a while.”</p><p>“Cool,” Tony said. He sidled past Lucy and plopped down in the matching chair.</p><p>As Dean walked back to the Impala with Sam, he glanced over at his brother and said, “Could go for a beer.”</p><p>“Figured.”</p><p>Ten-year-old Daniel Barnes lay in bed with the covers pulled up to his chest and asked his mother to check the closet.</p><p>She opened the folding doors wide, slid the clothes on plastic hangers to either side and declared the closet empty of bogeymen. “However, there is a lot of boy clutter on the floor.”</p><p>“Mom!”</p><p>“Just saying, Danny. Wouldn’t hurt you to clean up this mess every once in a while.”</p><p>“I don’t have anywhere to put my stuff.”</p><p>“Because you have too much stuff.”</p><p>“Check under the bed now,” he instructed her.</p><p>This was his nightly ritual: cup of water, closet check, bed check, nightlight on, kiss goodnight. The repetition comforted him. He watched as his mother got down on her knees, lifted the edge of the covers and peered under the bed.</p><p>“Oh, no!” she said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They’re back,” she said in mock terror. “Dust bunnies!”</p><p>“Is that all?” he asked, smiling.</p><p>“And some fallen action figures,” she said, climbing to her feet to stand at attention. “Otherwise, all clear.”</p><p>“Okay, then.”</p><p>She leaned over and kissed his forehead.</p><p>“Time to go to sleep, young man.”</p><p>“G’night, Mom.”</p><p>“Goodnight, honey.” She switched off the bedside lamp. The darkness triggered the sensor in his nightlight, which flickered on in response and spread a warm glow of illumination across the floor.</p><p>“Love you,” she said as she leaned against the doorjamb.</p><p>“You, too,” he said and succumbed to a yawn.</p><p>Quietly, she slipped out of his room and closed the door.</p><p>In a few minutes, Daniel slipped into a light sleep, unaware that a light wind had begun to gust—until the branches of the white oak tree outside his bedroom window began to tap repeatedly against the glass. He opened his eyes, completely awake now but unsure what had roused him. A moment later, he heard the tap, tap, tap-tap on his window. He sat up in bed and looked out into the night sky. In his mind, the tree branches transformed into monstrous arms swaying before him, the tips of the branches now hands reaching for him, blocked only by a thin layer of glass...</p><p>“Mom!” he cried out.</p><p>A few seconds passed.</p><p>Tap, tap-tap, TAP!</p><p>“Mom! Where are you?”</p><p>He heard a rush of footfalls from the hallway outside his room. His mother burst into the room, looked left and right for any potential threat before her gaze settled on him.</p><p>“Daniel? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“The tree... it was moving...”</p><p>She approached the window and stood there for a few moments. Suddenly, the tip of a tree branch swayed far enough to scrape along the windowsill. To Daniel’s ears it sounded like fingernails—or claws. He shuddered.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she said in a soothing voice. “Getting breezy out there. The tree branch brushed your window, that’s all.”</p><p>“It scared me,” Daniel said. “Looks creepy.”</p><p>Hands on her hips, she stood over him and shook her head. “Daniel, you’re perfectly safe here. You can’t be afraid of every little shadow and bump. Okay?”</p><p>“Okay,” he said glumly.</p><p>“Be a brave boy for me?”</p><p>Daniel nodded. “I’ll try.”</p><p>“That’s what I like to hear,” she said and kissed his forehead again. “I’ll ask your father to trim that tree in the morning.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>This time, on her way out, she left his door ajar, so she could hear him better if he called for her. Accepting the compromise, Daniel tried to sleep again. He rolled onto his side, back to the window so he wouldn’t see the shadows, and drew his knees up close to his chest.</p><p>Wind and shadows, he told himself. No reason to be scared...</p><p>Another yawn, wider than before, and he was drifting off to sleep much sooner than he would have expected after his scare.</p><p>With his eyes closed and sleep tugging him down into unconsciousness, he failed to notice the nightlight flicker and wink off. Seconds later, he was oblivious as a splotch of darkness in an upper corner of his bedroom uncoiled and drifted toward him like tendrils of obsidian and impenetrable smoke. The darkness flowed across his bedcovers, passed over his face and gathered over his bed’s headboard. Slowly, as the darkness condensed, a shape began to emerge, like a silhouette, but in three dimensions. First a head formed, dark and unknowable and, beneath it, a pitch-black arm extended from the center mass, the tip stretching to coalesce into a hand and shadowy fingers that splayed across the boy’s forehead.</p><p>Outside Daniel’s home, the wind picked up, gusting as with a coming storm and the white oak’s branches stirred and swayed and became agitated, reaching for the house and the boy within...</p><p>Dean brought a cold six-pack of beer back to the motel room, stuffing a few bottles in the packed ice bucket to keep them chilled. Considering he had two other six-packs, he needed a much bigger bucket. Or an ice chest. The local supermarket would have a cooler. He sipped from a bottle as Sam perused old news stories on the laptop computer.</p><p>“Found it,” he said eventually and spun the computer around for Dean’s benefit.</p><p>“That accordion was a ‘68 Dodge Charger?” Dean asked.</p><p>“That’s what it says.”</p><p>Dean peered at the screen.</p><p>“Color matches. Cherry red, white racing stripe.”</p><p>Sam turned the laptop around again, scrolled down through the story.</p><p>“Hit a retaining wall. Driver’s side took the brunt of the impact.”</p><p>“Even if it was possible to repair that damage,” Dean said, “doesn’t explain how the car can disappear. Could be a lookalike car but unless it belongs to a magician...”</p><p>“Maybe it’s a vengeful car, not a vengeful spirit.”</p><p>“All we need. Car with a grudge. Christine comes to Clayton Falls.”</p><p>“Kid lived with his paternal grandmother,” Sam said, relaying information as he skimmed through articles. “Mother died in childbirth. Father and son lived in New Jersey. Father died five years ago. Massive heart attack. Heavy smoker. Grandmother only surviving relative. Took the boy in.”</p><p>“Lot of tragedy in that family.”</p><p>“That dead teenager is the only connection we have to any of these sightings.”</p><p>“If it’s not a vengeful spirit,” Dean said. “Maybe we need to concentrate on the living.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel Barnes squirmed in his bed.</p><p>Lost deep in REM sleep, his eyes darted back and forth beneath his eyelids, tracking the stuff of nightmares. Removed from the waking world, he was unaware of the shadow-hand and fingers pressed to his forehead. He was equally oblivious to the creature of darkness taking form over his bed. The creature’s head continued to solidify, with glowing red eyes pulsing in its sunken cheeks. Beneath a long, malformed nose, its mouth opened wide to reveal a row of black, fanglike teeth. As the young boy moaned in distress, the creature hissed in delight.</p><p>Outside the boy’s bedroom window, a rush of wind pummeled the house. The white oak’s branches heaved up, and dropped, twisted and shook, flailed in the night, striking the house’s siding, scraping the windowsill and rapping against the windowpanes with a ragged drumbeat of persistence.</p><p>When a branch struck the window with enough force to crack it, the shadowy creature emitted a gurgling hiss of satisfaction and withdrew its hand from the boy’s forehead.</p><p>Daniel’s head whipped to the side and a startled cry escaped his lips. A moment later, he awoke and pushed himself up from the tangled bedcovers as if he were coming up for air. Staring across the dark room, without even the benefit of the nightlight’s meager glow, he called for his mother again.</p><p>Behind him, the shadowy form lost its cohesion, thinning to irregular splotches of darkness that climbed up the wall and slid across the other shadows, once again invisible and unknowable.</p><p>“Mom!”</p><p>This time his father came down the hall and pushed the door open. Even in the best of times, Daniel’s father had less patience for his nighttime fears than his mother. Daniel hung his head, ready to apologize despite the feeling of dread that kept his heart racing.</p><p>“Daniel, your mother asked me to come up here,” his father said, standing at the foot of the bed, arms across his chest. “You need to stop this nonsense.”</p><p>“I’m scared.”</p><p>“It’s just a storm. You don’t—“</p><p>“The tree broke the window.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Look!”</p><p>But Daniel’s father had already crossed to the window to assess the damage.</p><p>“You’re right. It’s cracked. Hard to see.” Daniel’s father walked over to the doorway and flicked on the light switch. Nothing happened. He tried again. “Try your lamp.”</p><p>The wind gusted and rattled the house. Outside the damaged window, the tree branches danced in the wind.</p><p>Daniel leaned over and tried his bedside lamp to no effect.</p><p>“Broken,” he said.</p><p>“No. Looks like we’ve lost power.”</p><p>His father returned to the window, ran his hand along the crack.</p><p>“Okay,” he said and turned back to face Daniel. “I’ll put some tape on this. Tomorrow, I’ll trim the branches so they don’t—“</p><p>Suddenly the wind howled with renewed ferocity and a thick branch thrust forward, shattering the window with a loud crash. Daniel jumped out of bed with a cry of alarm. Then he noticed his father hunched over, making choking noises as he tried to say something.</p><p>“Gah—gah—guhgh!”</p><p>For a moment, Daniel’s imagination tried to fill in the blanks. He thought his father had grown a third arm—that it had sprouted from the center of his chest and was dripping on the floor. But as he took a step toward his father in the dark room, the true nature of the shape became apparent. The branch had come through the window and speared his father, whose blood was now running down the length of the branch and dripping all over the floor.</p><p>“Dad...”</p><p>His father’s head rolled to the side, almost resting on his shoulder. Blood leaked from his mouth, forming little bubbles that spread like foam across his chin.</p><p>“Dad!”</p><p>The house shook, vibrating beneath Daniel’s feet.</p><p>Outside the window, the white oak seemed to heave against the house, all its branches surging upward. Daniel’s father was lifted by the branch that had impaled him, up to his tiptoes, and held swaying there. His gleaming eyes seemed to stare at Daniel, even as his head flopped from side to side. Hands that had grasped the bloody tree branch now fell limp at his sides. The branch then pulled him to the right and back to the left, forcing his dragging legs to perform the plodding steps of a macabre dance.</p><p>Daniel backed away until his own numb legs bumped against his bed. Then he dropped to the floor and wrapped his arms around his knees, head turned to the side as he screamed over and over again.</p><p>“Mom!”</p><p>Before she returned and without his notice, the splotchy darkness slipped out of the bedroom window and into the night.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Another sleepless night was what the gray-haired woman had come to expect. She hardly ever slept well in her bed. Maybe an hour here, a half-hour there, tossing and turning. Aches and pains too numerous to categorize contributed to her long nights. But not all the aches were physical. Memories had a way of keeping her awake into the wee hours. Invariably, she would surrender the idea of sleeping in her bed and, instead, settle into her musty recliner and watch television. If she was lucky, she’d catch a few hours of sleep spread over the long night.</p><p>Lately, her level of exhaustion had become more pronounced. Throughout the day, she would bumble through her inconsequential routines and by evening, she had so little energy it was a wonder she didn’t collapse simply from climbing the stairs or completing a minimal amount of housework. Nothing seemed to matter much to her anymore. She wondered how long she could go on simply marking time. Living had become a reflex, a habit. She found no joy in it, and hadn’t for some time.</p><p>She reached for the remote control and her hand, with veins and liver spots more prominent than they’d been a week ago, trembled with the effort. Such a simple act was almost beyond her current level of physical stamina. Maybe it wasn’t physical. Maybe it was a neurological issue. Health problems plagued the elderly, became the focus of their twilight years. Marking time in the interval between taking one pill and the next.</p><p>She turned the television on and leaned back in the recliner, her eyelids already heavy with a sleep deficit she could never pay. It would do her good to see the doctor. Another routine to pass the time. Of course, he didn’t care if she got better. Wouldn’t know her name if she bumped into him on the street. But he tried to shock her with predictions of death and disease. Inevitable, but he made it entertaining. A jolt to remind her she was alive and not yet worm food.</p><p>Yes, she’d pass some time with the doctor again because, oddly enough, he was a comfort to her. He was as familiar with death and violence and tragedy as she had become...</p><p>Images flickered on the television set and she was only half conscious of them. As she slipped in and out of her troubled sleep, she was unaware of another image, an expanse of darkness that slipped under her door like a trick of the light, then flowed up her wall, slid across her ceiling and descended to the back of her chair, dyeing the ivory antimacassar on her headrest deepest black. And there it began to swell into a roiling mass of darkness with a head and glowing red eyes rising from the center and arms growing from the sides. Spindly, crouched legs formed beneath the torso. These were new but improving, strengthening. As were its abilities.</p><p>The darkness became as comfortable as the old woman in her recliner. The house and the chair and the woman had already become familiar to the monster. It had mined a rich vein of darkness with this one. But soon their collaborations would come to an end. It sensed time was running out. Yet all was not lost. The town presented so many intriguing possibilities. And the night was young.</p><p>As twin red eyes burned in its obsidian head, it reached out with fingers of solidified darkness and draped them over her forehead. In moments, it began to feed.</p><p>In keeping with his nightly routine, after grading the eighthgrade science homework and preparing a lesson plan for the next school day, Harvey Dufford jogged along Welker Street, turned left on Main, past the municipal building and the factory fire memorial and then turned left again onto Bell Street.</p><p>He followed Bell past the commercial district and into the business district at the west end of Clayton Falls. Most of his jogging route kept him in view of the restaurants, nightclubs, and shops with evening hours. Though the crime rate in town was generally low, he thought it prudent to remain in high pedestrian traffic areas for his daily cardio workout. And so it was always with a little trepidation that he concluded his nighttime run by crossing through the cluster of professional buildings across from his townhome community. Most of these offices closed at five or six o’clock with the exception of the scattered general practitioner or dentist who offered evening hours once or twice a week.</p><p>Streetlights shone down on the modest parking lots, revealing an eerie absence of cars and people. Sometimes Dufford experienced an otherworldly vibe from the professional buildings, as if he had slipped out of the normal time stream and had lost contact with the rest of humanity.</p><p>On more than one occasion, he had considered planning a new route to avoid these “dead” spots, but ultimately he thought they provided motivation for him toward the end of his run. He was closing in on fifty-five years of age and his legs lacked the spring of youth, had for some time, and that leaden-leg feeling regularly overcame him toward the end of his route. Probably psychological, knowing he was almost finished making his body crave rest. So why not counter the physical exhaustion with a burst of adrenaline derived from his anxiety when jogging through this deserted section of town.</p><p>As he approached the cluster of professional buildings, the bright lights of open stores became scattered, the sounds of pedestrian activity became hushed, the rush of cars separated into the passage of individual vehicles separated by increasing intervals, as if the heartbeat of the town weakened and slowed, nearing a flatline. That was when Dufford picked up his pace, placing one foot in front of the other faster and faster with each long stride, forcing himself into a last sprint to feel his heart rate quicken. His mouth opened and he sucked down air in great gulps to satisfy his demanding lungs.</p><p>He leaned into a left turn and entered the parking lot of the first structure. To his right, the beige one- and two-story buildings presented dark lobbies behind Plexiglas doors with official office hours posted in the form of black stencils on the glass or on freestanding message boards. To his right, beyond the parking islands, grassy mounds rose to vinyl privacy fencing. For Dufford, taking the shortcut back to his townhome instilled the claustrophobic sensation of running through a long tunnel.</p><p>A two-lane entranceway adjoined the next block of offices without providing any street exit. At regular intervals, signs were posted discouraging through traffic. Pedestrians were limited to narrow grass-covered gaps between clusters of connected buildings. The layout discouraged street and foot traffic for anyone without official business or a medical appointment. In the evening, hourly patrol car sweeps deterred loitering teenagers and would-be vandals.</p><p>But a lot can happen in an hour.</p><p>So focused was he on maintaining his brisk pace that several moments passed before Dufford noticed the thin layer of mist that puffed and swirled around his running shoes. Because he turned his attention to the unusual phenomenon, he failed to hear the padding sound coming up swiftly behind him until it was almost too late. The hairs on the back of his neck stood on end and he had a premonition someone was about to jump him.</p><p>Being mugged while jogging was something he often worried about, especially since he carried no wallet while exercising, relying on the emergency contact bracelet he wore in case of an accident. A mugger faced with a penniless victim was likely to react with extreme prejudice. Another reason he avoided deserted sections of town. But he couldn’t have been less prepared for his attacker, not in his wildest imaginings.</p><p>As he whirled around, raising a forearm for protection from a blow he was certain was imminent, he stared in horror at the monstrous shape bearing down on him. Its body was the size of a minivan, each of its eight red-banded legs as thick as a fire hose.</p><p>One part of his science-teacher brain identified the giant spider as a Mexican red-kneed tarantula while another part rationalized that it couldn’t survive at that extreme size—it would be crushed under its own weight. But somehow it did exist and it was chasing him. The most primitive part of his brain triggered his flight response.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had effectively run himself to near exhaustion before the threat had materialized. His heart raced wildly, he had a stitch in his side, and his legs felt like blocks of wood fastened awkwardly to his hips. He’d never felt closer to sixty years of age before.</p><p>He spun on his heel and veered to the right, narrowly avoiding a swipe by one of the creature’s hairy front legs. But one of the retractable claws at the tip of the leg tore through his soaked sweatshirt and caused him to stumble. Catching his balance on the round cement base of a parking lot lamppost, he placed the vertical obstacle between himself and the enormous spider—and immediately realized his mistake.</p><p>The tarantula wouldn’t have to move. Its legs were long enough to reach around the pole.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Lucy Quinn sat on one of the matching pair of Adirondack chairs, with her feet up on the porch railing, mirroring the relaxed posture of Tony Lacosta. The weight of the long night kept prodding her to get up and walk home. Inertia kept her seated. Tony’s parents had come home from work hours ago, whipping together a mix-and-match dinner of several nights’ leftovers to which they had invited her. Afterward, they had retired to the family room to watch TV, while Tony and Lucy returned to their porch chairs, each with a can of Coke. From the look Tony gave her when he took them out of the fridge, she could tell he wished they were beers.</p><p>Lucy didn’t think his parents minded her hanging out here with their son, even if they would never think of her as a good influence. But they probably figured he had fewer opportunities for trouble or mischief if he stayed close to home. And after what had happened to Steve, they were a bit traumatized by the occasional randomness of fatal accidents. Of course, Tony and Lucy, along with Steve, had been complicit in the accident that had cost Teddy his life. They had somebody to blame for that. And it made sense, when you factored in the carelessness of teenagers and driving under the influence. But Steve... run down by a stranger, out of the blue, like a bolt of lightning that could strike down anyone. How could a parent rationalize that? Or come to terms with it?</p><p>Lucy took a sip of her Coke. Shook the can. Not much left.</p><p>“So, have you talked to Steve’s parents?” she asked.</p><p>“Earlier,” Tony said. “They’re messed up about it, naturally. Weird thing is, I felt like I should apologize.”</p><p>She turned to look at him, his face almost amber in the wan streetlight, and he had a faraway look in his eyes.</p><p>“You feel guilty,” she said. It wasn’t a question.</p><p>“Yeah. Don’t you?”</p><p>She nodded. “They call it survivor’s guilt.”</p><p>“It was him or us, right?”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Tony tilted his Coke back, finished it off.</p><p>“Maybe we should have stayed together.”</p><p>After a long moment, she said, “Maybe.”</p><p>Reluctantly, she dropped her feet to the wooden porch floor and pushed herself out of the low chair.</p><p>“So... I should go.”</p><p>“Want a lift?”</p><p>“That’s okay,” she said. “A walk will clear my head. You going in?”</p><p>“In a few minutes.”</p><p>“See ya,” she said, taking the three stairs slowly, as if she had been drinking alcohol instead of a soft drink for the last few hours.</p><p>Tony waved when she glanced back from the bottom of his driveway.</p><p>“Later, Luce!”</p><p>After a few blocks, the weight of sadness she carried whenever she was around Tony eased. It wasn’t his fault. She’d felt the same sadness with Steve, though it hadn’t seemed as bad when all three of them were together. Now Steve’s absence reminded her of Teddy’s absence, not that she ever needed a reminder of that. Though they put her in a melancholy frame of mind, she craved those connections. They helped her keep Teddy in her thoughts.</p><p>A fine white mist drifted across the street, undulating across the asphalt, spreading across the sidewalk like a living veil.</p><p>She hugged herself against the chill night air, rubbing her arms to generate some warmth and missing Teddy’s arm across her shoulders. It came as a surprise to her that she was trying to live in the past, trying to recapture those days of a year gone by, before the accident. And that past was forever lost to her. Her town, her neighbors, had that in common with her. They built a memorial to help them remember the past, but their past was fresher, only six months gone.</p><p>Every day, they placed flowers and stuffed animals at the memorial and lingered in their lost past as she lingered in hers. But few placed flowers at the site of the factory fire. The scorched brick of the crumbled building surrounded by the teetering wrought-iron fencing was too harsh a reminder of what had been lost and how horribly it had been wrenched from them. She would have to decide how long she’d cling to her memories of living while Teddy was still a part of her life. Would a day come when she looked forward to the future more than she longed for the past?</p><p>Ahead of her, a car engine raced with a throaty roar. A moment later, high beams flared, blinding her. She raised her forearm to shield her eyes. The car, a dark boxy shape cloaked behind its headlights, sat in the middle of the street, unmoving. She wondered how long the driver had been sitting there. Lucky somebody hadn’t crashed into him already. The street wasn’t busy but cars passed at regular intervals.</p><p>The engine raced again, and the car lurched forward.</p><p>“Jackass,” she whispered.</p><p>As if the driver heard her disparaging remark, the car swerved across the street toward her, along the shoulder and—</p><p>—jumped the curb!</p><p>As the car barreled down the sidewalk toward her, she had a horrifying thought. He’s trying to run me down!</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>If not for the parking lot lamppost between Harvey Dufford and the giant tarantula, the creature was close enough to pounce on him. Any move to the right or left and the spider would be on top of him in a heartbeat.</p><p>The tarantula brought its front pair of legs down on either side of him, boxing him in. For a moment he stared at the eye mound, the size of a cake box, with its two rows of four beady black eyes. The tarantula hunted by sensing vibration and sound rather than detecting movement with its relatively weak eyes, but they were alien and unnerving nonetheless. Dufford imagined they saw well enough to classify him as a meal.</p><p>Abruptly, the spider raised its two front pairs of legs high in the air, elevating its cephalothorax in a threat posture. Its pedipalps, bristling feelers that also served as food handlers, waved in front of his face like a pair of truncated legs, just out of reach. The spider’s double-segmented chelicerae extended, twin fangs at the tips dropping down but too far away to inject him with venom.</p><p>The venom from a normal tarantula wasn’t fatal to humans, but a tarantula of this extraordinary size would produce a proportionate amount of venom. Dufford figured he would fare no better than a field mouse. And if this monster managed to grab him, the chelicerae would coat him with corrosive digestive juices. The spider would wait for his flesh to liquefy, then suck it into its straw-shaped mouth.</p><p>Dufford barely had time to catch his breath before the tarantula dropped down onto all eight legs and scampered around the pole. Backing away, he put distance between himself and the giant spider before turning his back and running full speed. As he scanned ahead, looking for a weapon or a gap between blocks of buildings, he saw a rustpocked blue Ford F-150 pickup truck parked in front of an orthodontist’s office. A white rag tied to the door handle indicated the truck was disabled and awaiting a tow, or possibly that the driver planned to return with a container of gasoline or a replacement part.</p><p>Harvey tugged desperately at the passenger door handle. Unfortunately, it was locked.</p><p>He circled around the truck and tried the driver’s side— also locked. Ducking behind the bed of the pickup, Dufford listened for the sound of the tarantula and marveled at how stealthy it was despite its enormous size. On hands and knees, he peered under the truck to track its movement. Thick bristling legs pranced around the other side of the Ford, but too few of them. Not nearly enough on the ground, with more rising out of view by the second.</p><p>The pickup creaked on its worn shock absorbers a moment before a broad shadow fell across Dufford’s hiding place. Almost too late, he dropped to his back and looked up. Bristly pedipalps swept over his head, while the creature’s fangs sliced the air, dripping venom as the tarantula strained to reach him from its perch in the truck bed.</p><p>As one leg, then another came down on the driver’s side of the Ford, Dufford rolled underneath it. When the spider seemed committed to his side of the truck, Dufford rolled twice and emerged from the passenger side. He climbed to his feet and pumped his exhausted legs back the way he had come.</p><p>Behind him, the truck’s suspension groaned under the weight of the monstrous spider. Dufford tried to put the sound out of his mind and focused on getting the hell away from the area. Nearly doubled over from exertion, his breathing became harsh in his ears, his stride erratic. But he was almost out in the open again.</p><p>Once he exited onto Bell Street, he could flag down a car or, even better, a police cruiser. He could find a store that hadn’t closed yet, a nightclub or tavern, and take shelter there. The tarantula was too big to fit through a doorway but not big enough to burst through walls. At least he hoped that was true. If its strength was proportionate to its size...</p><p>He chanced a look back over his shoulder—</p><p>—and nearly screamed in terror.</p><p>The tarantula was close enough that he could make out the individual hairs on its waving pedipalps. The red-banded front legs were a blur of motion, their tips touching down several yards behind him. And the gap was closing.</p><p>Ahead, he saw Bell Street. A white panel truck zoomed by before he could even raise an arm to try to catch the driver’s attention. But that flash of contact gave him hope that he could escape—</p><p>He stumbled, the sole of his right running shoe sticking in the asphalt as if he had stepped in deep mud. He pulled it free, but lost the shoe. Then his left foot became mired. Tugging against that resistance, he lost the other shoe—and promptly planted his right foot into more clinging softness. The ground gave way under him. Incredibly, he was sinking into the asphalt, knee deep, then mid-thigh, then up to his hips before it stopped.</p><p>The ground was solid again, and he was trapped.</p><p>Pounding the asphalt until his fists were bloody, he twisted around and moaned as he saw the tarantula looming over him, rearing up on its two back pairs of legs in its threat posture. It slowly lowered itself over him, the cephalothorax coming down like the lid of a coffin.</p><p>For a brief moment, he hoped—prayed—that it would lose interest in him, and move away. A moment of stillness in which Dufford heard another car breeze along Bell Street, then the ominous rustle of the descending pedipalps.</p><p>He took a deep breath and yelled, “HELP!”</p><p>A dark flash of the chelicerae preceded twin white blurs as the hollow fangs plunged into his back like a pair of butcher knives. White hot pain sliced through his body. He convulsed, whether from shock or pain or from the effects of the venom, he couldn’t know. The pedipalps curled around him, the bristling hairs raking furrows in his skin as the appendages tried to pull him up against the grinding teeth under the chelicerae. But his body was trapped in the hardened asphalt and offered too much resistance.</p><p>Instead the tarantula pressed down against him, the chelicerae rubbing roughly against his skin, pushing him bodily left and right. Sticky fluid coated his bare neck and back, where it was exposed from the tears in his sweatshirt. It soaked into his wounds, into the fang punctures, and burned worse than alcohol. It felt as if gasoline had been poured into those cuts and ignited. His flesh bubbled and hissed, lighting his nerves on fire until unbearable white flared behind his eyelids blinding him with screaming pain.</p><p>Again the tarantula pressed down on him, but now it was feeding. His ears roared with the harsh sucking sound of his liquefied flesh being consumed, siphoned away through the spider’s straw-shaped mouth. Again the chelicerae washed over him, this time pressing against his face and throat.</p><p>A more intense round of burning pain filled his shrinking universe. He tried to scream but his left cheek dissolved, leaving a hole that exposed all the teeth on that side of his head, so that only a panicked, gasping hiss emerged from his burning throat. In seconds his left eyelid was gone, and the exposed eyeball went dark a moment later, dribbling down what was left of his cheek.</p><p>When the chelicerae pressed down again, he raised his arms to hold them back. But his hands were bare and soon coated in the sticky digestive fluids. With his remaining eye, he watched as the flesh of his fingers and palms and forearms ran down his sleeves like hot candle wax. But not for long. The suctioning mouth was greedy and wanted more of him. When his arms were useless, the chelicerae pressed down, enveloping what was left of his face as the pedipalps gripped him in a single-minded embrace.</p><p>Briefly, he became aware of the bass rumbling of a truck engine and a flare of light washing over him, bathing the tarantula’s bristling body and appendages in sharp contrast. But those sensory cues were overwhelmed and forgotten as the suffocating pressure of the spider’s mass bore down on him.</p><p>Sight abandoned him, and then hearing, and finally his nerves, so long on fire, fell silent as his exposed brain was given the spider’s special attention.</p><p>The tarantula savored every liquid morsel—until it abruptly vanished.</p><p>Lucy stared in horror as the car bore down on her. She briefly caught sight of the distinctive grill, with the chrome bumper below it, but had no time to process the memory. An image of Steve’s face flashed in her mind and that, more than anything, spurred her to action. She dodged to the left and hurled herself over the waist-high picket fence fronting the nearest house.</p><p>The car swerved again, even further across the sidewalk, and the front bumper clipped every slat and post in the fence in quick succession with a rapid series of explosive cracks, like machine gun fire.</p><p>Lucy rolled across the grass and sprang to her feet.</p><p>The owner of the house, a woman in a bathrobe, poked her head out the front door.</p><p>“What the hell was that?” she demanded.</p><p>“Call the police!” Lucy yelled, her gaze tracking the receding taillights. “That car tried to run me down.”</p><p>“Who? What kind of car?”</p><p>Lucy walked across the wooden debris out to the sidewalk, deep in thought as she stared back the way she had come. She turned back to the woman, her eyes wide in realization.</p><p>“A ‘68 Dodge Charger!”</p><p>“Wait! Where are you going?”</p><p>Lucy sprinted back toward Tony’s house. The car had killed Steve and had nearly killed her. But this time it hadn’t disappeared. She had a terrifying feeling that it hadn’t completed its night’s work.</p><p>She had Tony’s house in sight. She saw the Charger’s brake lights flare, the tires screaming against the asphalt as the car made an abrupt ninety-degree turn to face the front of the house.</p><p>“Tony!” she screamed.</p><p>As she ran, she shoved her hand into the pocket of her jeans, pulled out her cell and speed dialed her father. He answered on the second ring but static drowned out his voice.</p><p>“Dad! Come to Tony’s house now! It’s urgent!” she shouted, hoping he could hear her over the squawking interference, but a moment later the phone went silent. The light of the display and behind the buttons winked out, as if her battery had died in an instant.</p><p>Tony stood on the porch, leaning over the porch railing, confused as the Charger revved its engine.</p><p>“Hey!” he called, shielding his eyes from the bright headlights. “What the hell?”</p><p>“Tony, get inside!”</p><p>Instead of following her instructions, he looked over at her and shook his head.</p><p>“Lucy?”</p><p>The Charger lurched forward, engine roaring as it again jumped the curb, barreled across the front lawn, demolishing the small bushes Tony’s mother had planted, and slammed into the porch skirt.</p><p>Wood creaked and the porch sagged in the middle.</p><p>Tony staggered, grabbing onto the twisted railing to catch his balance.</p><p>The Charger reversed, nearly to the curb, then rushed forward again, smashing into the white planking of the porch floor. The center collapsed, in a V, and Tony pitched forward onto the hood of the Charger.</p><p>Lucy screamed.</p><p>The Charger reversed again, tires spinning and digging up clods of dirt from the lawn as Tony fell from the hood and whacked his head against the shattered planking. Dazed, he climbed to his feet and staggered in one of the long ruts in the dirt.</p><p>Tony’s father flung open the front door of the house, a baseball bat gripped in both hands. Behind him, Tony’s mother appeared, looking past her husband’s shoulder, her face stark white with fear. In the time it took Tony’s father to take in the scene, the Charger had roared forward again.</p><p>Tony was pinned in the lights, trapped between the ruin of the porch and the oncoming front bumper of the car.</p><p>Tony raised his arms—</p><p>The Charger rammed him back into the shattered porch, the grill and bumper of the car crushing him against unyielding wood.</p><p>Lucy looked away from the horrifying image of Tony’s chest bursting open, broken ribs entangled with jagged shards of wood as his blood splashed everywhere. She dropped to her knees and sobbed.</p><p>Tony’s father yelled, an unintelligible sound of rage and anguish, and swung the bat like an axe, cracking the windshield of the Charger and pounding the hood. The bat shattered but he continued to smash what was left of it against the Charger until his hands bled.</p><p>With a roar, the Charger reversed, spinning into a turn so that it faced Lucy. The engine raced and she realized she was next. She was too distraught to move. Nothing could stop this car. It would kill her just as it had killed Steve and now Tony. She wondered if she’d been living on borrowed time for the past year. Maybe they were all supposed to die in the crash that had killed Teddy. And this was just fate cashing in its unpaid bills.</p><p>Tony’s mother ran down to her son’s broken body, dropping down beside him in her bathrobe and cradling him in her arms. Sirens wailed in the distance.</p><p>Before the Charger moved toward Lucy, Tony’s father jumped in front of it and pounded on the hood with his bare, bloody fists. Once, twice, a third time—</p><p>—and his fists came down on nothing but air.</p><p>The Charger had vanished.</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“We’ve been driving around aimlessly for fifteen minutes,” Sam said. “What exactly are we looking for, Dean?”</p><p>“It’s like the definition of porn.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I’ll know it when I see it.”</p><p>“Don’t you think Chief Quinn or Jeffries will call if anything weird happens?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean said. “But by the time they get around to it, might be too late to do anything. Hey, nap if you want. I see a headless horseman, I’ll be sure to wake you.”</p><p>“Funny, Dean,” Sam said. “But if we’re gonna do this, I need coffee.”</p><p>“Place up ahead,” Dean said, nodding toward a white sign with red letters at the corner of a parking lot: “Mack’s Qwik Mart.” “Says it’s open twenty-four seven.”</p><p>Dean flicked on his turn signal as he neared the convenience store’s parking lot.</p><p>Beside him, Sam sat up straight, leaned forward.</p><p>“Wait, what’s happening?” he asked, peering ahead of him.</p><p>“Don’t know.”</p><p>A group of agitated people in the parking lot were yelling at each other, pointing at the ground, and backing away. A woman with facial piercings, wearing a distressed leather jacket and jeans, ran to the front of the store and pounded on the windows, screaming, “Get out!”</p><p>Walking on wobbly legs, an old man fell against the side of his Buick sedan, fumbled for his keys, then gave up and hustled out of the parking lot. A young woman with bleached blond hair dropped two plastic bags filled with soft drink bottles and unhealthy snacks and raced across the parking lot as if a Hellhound was on her heels. A few people dashed toward their cars, minivans, and SUVs, while others simply followed the blonde’s lead.</p><p>“Dude,” Dean said. “This is porn.”</p><p>As the old-timer who’d lost his keys lumbered heedlessly out into the street, Dean stomped on the brake pedal to avoid hitting him. Under bushy gray brows, the man’s eyes were wild.</p><p>“Get back!” he yelled. “Get back while you can!”</p><p>After that frantic warning, the old man continued his retreat.</p><p>Dean slowed to school zone speed and drove up to the parking lot. He was halfway up the entrance ramp when he hit the brake again—hard. Dean would risk his own life before he would imperil the chassis of the Impala. After all, the Impala couldn’t defend itself.</p><p>“Sinkhole!” he said.</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>Sam was right: the word ‘sinkhole’ didn’t begin to cover what was happening in the convenience store’s parking lot. The ground was falling away at an alarming rate, from the center of the parking lot outward, the blacktop was crumbling like burnt toast.</p><p>Dean shifted the Impala hurriedly into reverse. The cars lined up behind the row of cement bollards protecting the Plexiglas front of Mack’s Qwik Mart tilted backward as the back wheels lost their support. A metallic-blue Nissan Murano was the first to fall. It landed with a resounding crash, shattering the back and side windows. A silver Dodge Durango followed soon after, slamming into the Nissan with a concussive whump and a protesting screech of metal. The theft alarm whooped and wailed.</p><p>Dean twisted around to look through the rear window of the Impala. Seeing the road clear, he gunned the engine and the Impala lurched backward and accelerated away from the convenience store.</p><p>“Dean?”</p><p>“You’ll get your coffee, Sam.”</p><p>“That’s not what I—“</p><p>“That sinkhole’s eating cars,” Dean said. “Keeping my baby clear of that.”</p><p>Sam shook his head, rolling his eyes. “First things first, right?”</p><p>“Damn straight.”</p><p>Dean spun the wheel and backed into a parking space along the curb on the far side of the street, a couple of hundred feet from Mack’s Qwik Mart. A few moments later, they were out of the car and sprinting back to the site of the chaos.</p><p>Some of the people who had fled the store or abandoned their cars in the unstable parking lot stood on the shoulder of the road, staring in disbelief at the ongoing devastation. The Winchesters shouldered past the line of gawkers, repeating “FBI” and “Move aside” until they reached the parking lot.</p><p>Sam turned to the people and held up his FBI laminate.</p><p>“I need everyone to back up to the far side of the street,” he stated firmly. “For your own safety. Move!”</p><p>A few nodded, others grumbled, but they all backed up.</p><p>From the edge of the parking lot, Dean looked down into the sinkhole. More like a friggin’ abyss, he thought. A few cars parked on either side of the lot were within a few brittle blacktop inches of falling into the hole, but what concerned him more were the two people standing at the entrance to the convenience store. An attractive blond woman no more than thirty, with a panic-stricken look on her face, straining to pull away from the wiry teenaged boy wearing a nametag and green polyester shirt that probably served as a store uniform. The teenager had a firm grip on her upper arm to keep her from running headlong into the pit.</p><p>Dean called across the chasm.</p><p>“Ma’am, you need to stay where you are.”</p><p>“My son’s asleep in the van!” she yelled back.</p><p>Glancing to the right, Dean saw a blue Chevy conversion van. Aside from the windshield, which faced away from him, all the windows were tinted. If the kid had any sense, he would have lit out soon as the first car crashed in the hole.</p><p>“How old?”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>Damn, Dean thought. “Sam! We got a problem. Kid trapped in a van.”</p><p>Dean pointed at the Mack’s employee. “Young man, what’s your name?”</p><p>“Anson.”</p><p>“There a back exit out of the store?”</p><p>“Yes,” Anson said. “But there’s a wall behind the store.”</p><p>“Can you get over it?”</p><p>“No. Wait, yes, we have a ladder for changing lights.”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. “I want you to take this woman and go out the back.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving my son!” the woman cried.</p><p>“I’ll get your son,” Dean responded.</p><p>“I’m not leaving until I know he’s safe.”</p><p>Dean sighed. He looked at the strip of sidewalk they stood on. At the moment, it seemed secure. The blacktop had crumbled away almost to the bollards. Maybe they provided some extra support.</p><p>“First sign that sidewalk’s failing, you leave. Okay?”</p><p>After a moment, she nodded reluctantly.</p><p>Beside him, Sam said, “What do you have in mind?”</p><p>Dean noticed a four-foot high chain-link fence ran along both sides of the convenience store parking lot. Easy enough to climb over it to get to the van.</p><p>“You take the passenger side. I’ll take driver’s side.”</p><p>“Figures.”</p><p>Sam started to run along the outside of the fence. Dean was a step behind him when he noticed the conversion van shudder. The blacktop under the left rear tire was crumbling. He veered to the right, but stayed on the inside of the fence, running along a thin strip of sidewalk that abutted the chainlink fence. The ground shook beneath his feet. A quick glance at the van and he saw it drop a few inches and rock side to side.</p><p>The front bumper of a late seventies gold Pontiac Firebird was close enough to kiss the fence. Without a moment’s hesitation, Dean jumped on the hood of the car and crossed over it.</p><p>Someone across the street yelled, “Hey!”</p><p>“You gotta be kidding me,” Dean muttered. Joker’s car was ten seconds from joining the vertical demolition derby and he was worried about a ding on the hood?</p><p>Dean bounded across the hoods of two more cars and landed beside the Chevy van as Sam was leaping sideways over the fence. The passenger side doors were locked. This close, he could hear a frightened child crying inside the van. Dean circled around to the driver’s side, which was also locked.</p><p>“Here,” the young mother called. “The keys!”</p><p>She tossed them underhand to Dean.</p><p>The van lurched as more ground gave way.</p><p>Dean staggered, but snatched the keys out of the air by the dyed-pink rabbit’s foot keychain. He opened the driver’s door and was about to hit the button to unlock all the doors when he was flung forward against the steering wheel.</p><p>The woman screamed. Dean felt the van sliding violently backward. Sam’s startled face flashed by the passenger-side window and was gone a second later.</p><p>A moment or two of eerily quiet free fall and then a jarring impact.</p><p>First Dean was tossed up against the steering wheel, banging his already bruised ribs. Then he came down hard against the driver’s seat. With one leg hanging outside the van, the door slammed painfully against his knee, but provided enough resistance to prevent him from hurtling through the interior of the van. He kicked the door with his other leg to free himself, and promptly sprawled across the front seats. Twisting around, he peered down.</p><p>Fortunately, the three-year-old boy was buckled into a child safety seat strapped to the passenger side captain’s chair in the second row. Terrified, his cheeks streaked with tears, the boy stared at Dean as if he were an alien life form. The sudden drop and impact must have stunned the crying jag right out of him.</p><p>“It’s okay, kid,” Dean said trying to sound calm. “I’m gonna get you outta here.”</p><p>“Where’s Momma?”</p><p>“Your mom’s fine. She’s up—back in the store.”</p><p>“I want Momma.”</p><p>“I’m gonna take you to her. Okay?”</p><p>The boy nodded. “Want Momma.”</p><p>“We’ve established that,” Dean said. “But I need you to work with me. Okay?”</p><p>Another nod. This time the kid gave him an expectant look.</p><p>“What’s your name, kid?”</p><p>“Hunter.”</p><p>Dean smiled. “No kidding?”</p><p>The boy nodded solemnly. “Hunter Riley Fields.”</p><p>Gravel and chunks of blacktop pelted the exterior of the van like hailstones with biblical aspirations. One particularly large chunk stuck and starred the windshield. A few more plinked and plunked against the hood. Dean tried not to think about what might happen if a big enough rock—or even another car—came through the windshield at that moment. Or what would happen if a fuel tank ruptured and something sparked. No, he wouldn’t think about that at all.</p><p>“Okay, Hunter,” Dean said with a serious nod of his own. “Let’s do this.”</p><p>He reached between the front seats and stretched his arm to the far seat in the second row, pushing the release button on the kid’s safety seat. Accustomed to the seat routine, the boy pulled the V-straps up over his head without any prompting. Dean smiled reassuringly.</p><p>“Great job, Hunter. Now, let’s get out of here.”</p><p>The boy started to climb out of the seat.</p><p>“Whoa!” Dean said. “Careful, now. Give me your hand.”</p><p>Dean stretched to meet the kid’s small hand but adjusted his position to get a better grip on his arm.</p><p>“One, two... three!”</p><p>With one quick tug, Dean pulled the boy up to the front— top—row of seats.</p><p>Dean backed out of the door, propping it open with his back as he stood in the dirt and gravel slope of the sinkhole. The van rested against the side of the hole at a sixty degree angle. With one arm wrapped around Hunter, he moved away from the van and let the door slam shut. The back end of the van rested against a beige Camry that was almost completely submerged. Even as Dean watched, the van’s tires were sinking into the dirt and crumbled blacktop.</p><p>“Dean!” Sam called from above.</p><p>Dean spotted his brother braced against the chainlink fence in front of where the van had been parked, his forearms hooked over the fence so he could clutch it while leaning forward for a better view. Sam was almost twentyfive feet above.</p><p>“We’re fine,” Dean said.</p><p>“Hunter!”</p><p>“Momma!” Hunter said, waving at his mother who stood beside the store clerk. The bollard nearest the pair tilted at a forty-five degree angle. The sidewalk wouldn’t last much longer. But they had a more immediate problem.</p><p>A banana-yellow Mini Cooper that had been parked one space closer to the store’s entrance was inching backward and leaning at a precarious angle. Clumps of dirt and chunks of blacktop broke away from beneath its back tires. With a scrape of metal on asphalt, the Mini Cooper pitched backward, listing to the left as it hurtled toward Dean and the boy.</p><p>Dean whispered, “Oh, crap...”</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Ehrich Vogel shuddered in his sleep, rolled to the left and a few moments later rolled to the right, becoming tangled in his sweat-soaked sheets. Mumbling softly, his words unintelligible, the tone of his voice escalated from concern to agitation to fright. His distress culminated with him shouting, “No! No! NO!”</p><p>With the last protest, his eyes opened wide and he swung his tangled legs over the edge of the bed, breathing harshly. Pressing his good hand to his chest, he felt his heart hammering beneath his ribs. He could imagine himself having a fatal heart attack at that moment. Widowed, retired, alone. Nobody would miss him for days. While he waited for his heart rate to return to normal, he leaned over the bed, forearms resting on his thighs, head hanging.</p><p>Because of his huddled posture, he neither saw nor sensed the mass of darkness dispersing above his bed, thinning itself into deep shadow and drifting along the walls and out through a narrow gap in the windowsill.</p><p>His thoughts turned inward, to the nightmare. The same one that had visited him on a regular basis for the past twenty years. Only worse. The explosion, the partial cave-in at Croyden Creek began the same, but this time more than his right arm had been crushed. He’d been standing in a new section, next to a support beam and the explosion blew it clear.</p><p>Coal dust and methane. Bad combination.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>One moment he’d been standing, the next he was buried under an avalanche of rock and dirt, his ribs crushed. In the nightmare, he couldn’t escape, couldn’t breathe. Felt his life slipping away down in the darkness.</p><p>Vogel stood on weak legs and walked to the bathroom, bending over to splash water on his face with his trembling left hand. The fingers of his right hand were mangled. He couldn’t do much with the muscles of that arm and, as a result, it had atrophied. After the cold water cleared the fog of sleep, he stood up straight and took several deep breaths.</p><p>The real explosion and cave-in at Croyden Creek Mine had been bad, but the nightmare scenario had been far worse. Nevertheless, bad had been bad enough. After the accident, he never set foot in that mine or any other mine ever again. That didn’t stop the nightmares from haunting him through the years.</p><p>Outside, the wind howled and his bedroom windows rattled in their frames. A flash of lighting lit the room in stark black and white. The rumble of thunder shook the eaves of his house.</p><p>This troubled night, with the cave-in images especially vivid in his head, he decided he’d had enough sleep. Staying awake, whether watching a movie or reading a book, was his only guarantee that another nightmare wouldn’t finish the course of the first, and this time see him buried alive in a deep, dark pit.</p><p>If nothing else, his heart would thank him.</p><p>As the yellow blur of the Mini Cooper fell toward him, Dean clutched the three-year-old boy against his chest and flattened himself against the driver’s door of the Chevy conversion van.</p><p>“Hold on!” he said into Hunter’s ear.</p><p>The Mini Cooper slammed into the partially submerged Camry with a booming clash of metal, and a popping crunch of breaking safety glass. The yellow car’s roof missed Dean and Hunter by less than a yard.</p><p>Hunter’s mom screamed and the boy started to cry again.</p><p>“Everybody calm down!” Dean shouted. “I’ve got this.” He took a deep breath. “Hunter, can you hang onto my neck?” The boy nodded. “Good.”</p><p>Dean shifted Hunter to his back, with his small arms wrapped around Dean’s neck. But he didn’t trust the boy’s ability to hang on as he climbed, so Dean kept his left hand clamped over both of the boys’ fists. He scrambled up the steep slope high enough to climb onto the side of the Mini Cooper.</p><p>The small car’s undercarriage had sunk into the side of the sinkhole facing the front of the store, so Dean jumped onto the slope, with an awkward three-point landing. His shoes immediately began to sink into the soft earth and his free hand couldn’t find any reliable purchase.</p><p>He realized two things at that moment: No way was he climbing out of the sinkhole unassisted; and that strong odor assailing his nostrils was definitely gasoline. Somewhere in the mangled pileup of cars, a fuel line had been compromised or a gas tank ruptured.</p><p>He looked to where Sam was inching along the fence to track their movements.</p><p>“Sam!”</p><p>Their eyes met and Sam nodded grimly. He looked over to the store clerk.</p><p>“Anson! You sell rope in there?”</p><p>“What? Rope? No, we don’t—wait. What about clothesline?”</p><p>“Clothesline is perfect.”</p><p>“We have packages. Hundred feet.”</p><p>“Good. Get one.”</p><p>While Anson ran into the store, Sam made his careful way along the fence and then hurried along the sidewalk to join Hunter’s mother. Anson came out and handed Sam the shrink-wrapped package of white clothesline, which Sam quickly ripped open to play out the coiled line.</p><p>“Hey!” Anson yelled. “Bad idea, man!”</p><p>Dean looked to the far side of the parking lot and saw one of the bystanders, a balding man in his forties, edging around the back of the gold Firebird.</p><p>“The hell’s he doing?” Dean called.</p><p>“Sir!” Sam yelled. “Get back!”</p><p>The man tossed a dismissive wave in Sam’s direction.</p><p>“I’m saving my car!”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “You believe that guy?”</p><p>“Dude, seriously?” Sam said.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You... and the Impala.”</p><p>“Totally different.”</p><p>“Right. Because you have all your hair,” Sam said, then shouted at the man. “You can’t move your car! It’s trapped.”</p><p>The back wheels of the Firebird were two feet from the edge of the expanding sinkhole. The front bumper was too close to the chain-link fence. No room to turn or maneuver. The car was as good as gone.</p><p>Ignoring Sam, the man started and gunned his engine. Then the Firebird edged forward, pressing into the metal fence. It seemed he intended to run over the fence and drive off the side of the lot. But the center of his front bumper pressed against one of the vertical support posts, which was anchored in cement and wouldn’t budge. He floored the accelerator, which caused the back wheels to spin and squeal against the compromised blacktop. What he couldn’t see was that the wheels were accelerating the erosion process. He threw it in reverse and backed up a bit, expecting to ram the fence. But the back wheels hit the lip of the sinkhole before he expected and they dropped over the edge with a loud squeal as the undercarriage slammed into the ground.</p><p>“Sam! The rope!” Dean shouted.</p><p>With the sound of screeching metal behind him, Dean reached up and caught the end of the clothesline. Sam was about to secure the other end to a bollard, but noticed the one leaning dangerously forward and backed up to loop the line through one of the store’s door handles. Meanwhile, Dean had looped the other end around Hunter’s body, snugging it up under his arms and making a few quick knots.</p><p>He checked it was secure, then called, “Ready!”</p><p>Sam stepped out to the edge of the sidewalk and pulled the line up end over end, lifting Hunter out of the pit. He caught the boy in his arms and the mother cried out in relief. Rather than fussing with the knots, Sam took a folding knife from his pocket and cut the rope behind the boy’s back and handed him to his mother.</p><p>“Oh, thank God,” she said, squeezing her son against her chest and kissing him repeatedly on his cheeks. “Thank you. Thank you, both!”</p><p>“Anson, take her and the boy out through the back,” Sam instructed.</p><p>Dean looked over his shoulder, wincing at the protesting squeals of metal. The Firebird slipped inexorably backward, tilting up like a breaching whale captured in slow motion video. Sparks showered across the blacktop, reminding Dean of the gasoline leaking somewhere in the pit beneath him.</p><p>“Gonna get hot down here, Sam!”</p><p>The loose bollard broke free, arcing down toward Dean’s head. He jumped to the side, sprawling in the dirt as the cement post crashed through the side window of the Mini Cooper. The small car and the Camry beneath it settled deeper into the pit.</p><p>The joker in the Firebird opened the door of the car and jumped out. The door slammed shut, clipping him on the shoulder as he fell and sent him sprawling toward the back of the car. The treacherous ground gave way beneath him. He shouted in alarm as he toppled head first into the pit in what amounted to a half somersault. Landing with a thud on the passenger door of a half-submerged black minivan, he stared up into the night sky moaning.</p><p>Sam looked from the teetering Firebird to its owner twenty feet below.</p><p>“Oh, no.”</p><p>“Hey, Ass-hat!” Dean shouted. “Move!”</p><p>The man rubbed the back of his head. Then it suddenly dawned on him.</p><p>“My car...”</p><p>The Firebird dropped straight down like a hammer on an anvil. And the owner had the misfortune of lying between the two.</p><p>The crunch of shattered bones was almost completely masked by the collision of steel driving into steel. Almost. Slick gobs of burst flesh and an arterial spray of blood splattered over the black minivan. The Firebird toppled over with another crash, revealing a red pulpy mess barely identifiable as human remains.</p><p>Grimacing, Dean looked away and not simply because the Firebird had taken its name all too literally. Active tongues of flame roamed along the undercarriage, hungrily seeking a more plentiful fuel source.</p><p>With renewed urgency, Dean wrapped the clothesline around his waist several times and tied it off. He climbed hand over hand, scrambling up the loose earth to keep from losing ground. Sam pulled on his end, taking some of Dean’s weight away.</p><p>Red and blue lights flashed across the expanse of the sinkhole, accompanied by the brief whoop-whoop of a police siren. Dean recognized Chief Quinn’s voice over the police cruiser’s loudspeaker. “Everyone clear the area! Stand clear! Now!”</p><p>Dean spared a quick glance over his shoulder and saw the police chief exiting his cruiser and waving everyone back, across the street.</p><p>“Agents,” he called. “Fire truck’s on the way.”</p><p>“Sinkhole’s clear,” Dean yelled. “Everyone’s out.”</p><p>“Good,” Quinn said. “Now you’d better get the hell out of there.”</p><p>“Working on it,” Dean said.</p><p>He heard a woman call out to Quinn. “That man saved a little boy.”</p><p>Dean was halfway out of the pit when he noticed the crumbling dirt was gradually revealing the underside of the sidewalk. Cracks formed in the cement and sections started to break away and slide past him on the steep slope. Utility pipes, possibly cable, water and gas lines, ran under the sidewalk. To his right, a second bollard pitched into the hole.</p><p>In the distance, Dean heard the wail of police sirens.</p><p>By the time he reached the edge of the sidewalk, Sam was standing with his back pressed against the glass storefront, hauling on the thin clothesline but monitoring the disintegrating walkway. Sam caught Dean’s arm and pulled him up and out. At that moment, several sections of sidewalk tilted forward, pitching them toward the sinkhole.</p><p>The door securing the line had been pulled open by Dean’s weight.</p><p>“Go!” Dean said. “I got the line.”</p><p>Sam threw himself backward, through the open door and into the Qwik Mart. Dean’s feet started to slip out from beneath him, but he continued to support his weight with the clothesline until Sam caught his arm and tugged him inside. A glance back showed black smoke curling up from the pit, but the flames were beneath his line of sight.</p><p>An explosion blasted up from the sinkhole, followed by another, and a third—a chain reaction of automobiles exploding. The noise was deafening and debris sprayed everywhere. Chief Quinn took cover behind his cruiser.</p><p>Bystanders were shouting and screaming, racing to the far side of the highway. No doubt they’d witnessed the Firebird owner get himself killed. If nothing else, the man had helped by serving as a cautionary tale for others.</p><p>“That was close,” Dean said.</p><p>“Too close.”</p><p>Another explosion roared outside, this one rocking the convenience store. Overhead, the fluorescent lights flickered. Snack bags and aluminum cans crashed to the linoleum floor.</p><p>“Not good,” Dean said.</p><p>The vibration was only the beginning. The store itself was shifting, creaking, groaning. Dean recalled the utility lines running under the sidewalk out front. Natural gas. Maybe a propane tank out back. Crap.</p><p>“We’re not out of the woods yet, Sammy,” he observed.</p><p>They sprinted to the back of the store, kicking the fallen shop goods out of the way, past metal racks of chips and bread and boxes of doughnuts and assorted candy, and ducked through a door marked “Employees Only” into a cluttered stock room, and out through the rear exit.</p><p>Another explosion sounded, seeming even closer and with a bigger wallop. The back wall of the store shook and the ground beneath their feet shuddered. They couldn’t underestimate the instability caused by the sinkhole. For all Dean knew, the whole convenience store might drop onto the crushed cars at any moment.</p><p>“There,” Sam said, pointing to an eight-foot ladder propped against the cinderblock wall behind the store.</p><p>A few moments later, they had climbed over the wall and dropped down to the grass on the other side. They were shielded from the blast zone, but how far the sinkhole would spread was an open question. Anson, the store clerk, stood there awkwardly with his hands stuffed in his pockets, but Hunter and his mom were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Kid and his mom?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Gone,” Anson said, a clear tremor in his voice. “She wanted to hang around to thank you again, but after the first explosion...”</p><p>“Good parenting,” Sam said. “No place for a kid.”</p><p>“You okay?” Dean asked Anson.</p><p>“Yeah, fine,” the clerk said, nodding a bit frantically. “Called my manager. Told him I’d wait for him. Don’t think he believes me, how bad it is.”</p><p>“Picture’s worth a thousand words, right?” Dean said.</p><p>“If I were you, Anson, I’d wait a block or two away,” Sam said.</p><p>Then his cell phone rang. He glanced at the display and showed it to Dean. It said: “Clayton Falls Police.”</p><p>Sam answered and listened. He mouthed the name “Jeffries” to Dean.</p><p>“Yes. Yes, we did. Yes, I would classify that as weird. That too.” He listened for a few moments. “I’ll need addresses.” After a few moments, he said, “We found something weird as well.” Sam described the sinkhole, the subsequent explosions and one death. “Your chief ‘s here. Got his hands full with crowd control.” A short time later, he pulled the phone away from his ear.</p><p>“Well?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Walk with me,” Sam said, with a discreet nod in Anson’s direction.</p><p>They cut through someone’s backyard and circled around to the street, heading towards the Impala.</p><p>“Short version?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Giant tarantula. Killer trees. And the phantom Charger returned. Killed Tony Lacosta. And other reports are coming in, attempted home invasions, masked gunmen.”</p><p>“Busy night,” Dean said grimly.</p><p>“I’ll say. Police are spread thin,” Sam said. “But some of these... apparitions disappear in front of the witnesses or are gone by the time patrols arrive at the scene.”</p><p>“Fits the MO of whatever the hell this thing is.”</p><p>Lightning flashed across the sky, followed by a prolonged rumble of thunder. A gust of wind whipped around them, shaking nearby treetops. Behind them, another explosion rocked the night.</p><p>“Sam,” Dean said. “Don’t think this night’s done yet.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What’s closest?” Dean asked as soon as they were back in the Impala.</p><p>“Stay on Bell Street,” Sam said. “This takes us to the office buildings on the left, where the giant tarantula attacked.”</p><p>Dean shook his head and had to smile.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Just the fact that you said what you just said. With a straight face.”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Yeah. See what you mean.”</p><p>“Next stop, eight-legged freak.”</p><p>Ahead, a traffic light blinked to yellow, then red. Dean slowed, ready to run the light as soon as he checked the cross street. He craned his neck over the dashboard for a quick look and hit the brake hard.</p><p>A dark blue Honda Civic raced into the intersection going in excess of seventy miles per hour. The driver, apparently unaccustomed to high speeds on city streets, took the turn too wide, tires screeching in protest, and slammed broadside into a parked Dodge Ram pickup truck. The left side of the Civic rose off the ground, and would have rolled over a lower barrier.</p><p>“What the hell?” Dean said for what seemed like the tenth time that night.</p><p>The driver looked stunned, but uninjured. Fortunately, he was alone, because the passenger side had taken the brunt of the impact.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, pointing down the length of the cross street. “Look!”</p><p>“Is that—? No, that’s not what it is. Is it?”</p><p>“A pack of Velociraptors.”</p><p>“Velociraptors? As in Jurassic Park Velociraptors?”</p><p>“Actually, they’re from the Cretaceous per...” Sam cleared his throat. “Yes.”</p><p>Four Velociraptors bounded along the street on powerful hind legs in apparent pursuit of the Civic. Their reptilian heads—predominantly jaws lined with sharp teeth—darted side to side as they neared their prey, eyes that reminded Dean of alligators scanning for other predators.</p><p>The white-faced driver stared through his side window, watching slack-jawed while the hunting pack sprinted across the intersection and surrounded his wrecked car. Not that he had many options. Safest place at the moment was inside the car. But the Civic’s engine was still running, if roughly, so the driver floored the accelerator. The car tried to move, but the wreckage of the passenger side appeared to be entangled with the Dodge Ram. He shifted into reverse and the vehicle shuddered, immobile.</p><p>Ignoring his failed attempts to flee, the first Raptor scrambled onto the roof of the small car, the large sickleshaped claw on each rear foot tapping the metal, perhaps probing for weakness. Another Raptor shoved its head at the side window, fracturing the glass. One more strike and it would break through, giving its fearsome jaws access to the interior of the car.</p><p>Dean swung the Impala onto the shoulder of Bell Street. He jumped out with Sam right behind him. In their FBI guises, they both carried handguns, but Dean thought they might need something more powerful from the arsenal they stored in the trunk.</p><p>“Time travel, Sam?” Dean said incredulously. “These things come through a friggin’ wormhole? Even Cass is gonna have trouble sending them back to the... Crustacean period.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “So we put them down.”</p><p>Dean nodded emphatically. “Simple. I like it.”</p><p>He unlocked the trunk and raised the lid, peering inside.</p><p>“Dude—“ Sam said.</p><p>Dean glanced to the left, assessing. “Where’s the fourth Raptor?”</p><p>“Vanished. It just... winked out.”</p><p>One of the remaining three Velociraptors jumped on the hood of the Civic, leaned toward the windshield—and vanished.</p><p>Two remained. The one prowling on the roof, and the other attempting to poke its head into the car.</p><p>With a screeching roar, the second Raptor struck at the window, shattering the glass and darting his head inside with one quick motion. The driver huddled against the passenger door, as far from the driver’s side as possible. With the passenger side pinned against the Dodge Ram, he was, for the moment, safe.</p><p>“Something’s not right,” Sam said thoughtfully.</p><p>Dean stared at his brother. “When has this not been wrong?”</p><p>They armed themselves swiftly.</p><p>The Raptor on the Civic’s roof leapt down to the windshield and its weight crunched through the safety glass, detaching the whole window from the frame. Spinning around, the Raptor ducked forward, trying to shove its large snout into the interior of the car.</p><p>Sam was already walking across the street, his automatic raised in both hands as he drifted to the left for a better angle. He took two quick shots. Blood blossomed on the head of the Raptor crouched on the car’s hood. As it toppled sideways, it disappeared. The last raptor swung its head around to track Sam with its alligator eyes.</p><p>Screeching, it bounded toward Sam, picking up speed at an alarming rate.</p><p>Sam took two more shots. The first missed. The second clipped the outside of its left foreleg. Neither slowed it down.</p><p>Dean had his own automatic out, but Sam blocked a clear shot.</p><p>“Sam! Down!”</p><p>Sam dropped, just as the Raptor leapt, covering the remaining distance between them. As Dean sighted along the barrel and applied pressure on the trigger, the creature was gone.</p><p>Sam climbed to his feet, brushed himself off and gave Dean a look.</p><p>Dean shrugged, holstered his gun. “I had the shot.”</p><p>“Look on the bright side,” Sam said. “You saved a bullet.”</p><p>The Civic’s driver tried his door, found it jammed, so proceeded to climb out through the windshield frame. Sam helped him down.</p><p>“You okay, man?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m fine. I mean, considering what the hell just happened,” the driver said, his voice shaky. “You guys cops?</p><p>“FBI.”</p><p>“My name is Paul Hanes. Swear I wasn’t drinking,” the man said. “Although I could use a drink right now. It’s just— those things came after me and—what were they?”</p><p>“Velociraptors.”</p><p>“Dinosaurs? But they’re extinct...”</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean said. “Starting to have my doubts.”</p><p>“Any idea where they came from?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No. I mean, I had a fight with my girlfriend—Cathryn Rowsell at 142 Allen Drive if you need to verify this—and I noticed something coming out of the shadows when I unlocked the car door. I thought mugger, or carjacker, you know? Jumped in the car, locked the doors, and drove away fast as I could.” He spoke rapidly, propelled by nervous energy he couldn’t contain. “When I glanced in the rearview, I saw them—those four... lizards racing after me. I was so startled, I actually slowed down. One of them caught up to me and jumped on the trunk of the car. That was enough for me. I floored it and that one fell off. I didn’t slow down until I, well, until I crashed into the pickup.”</p><p>“Notice anything unusual before you got in your car?”</p><p>Hanes pursed his lips. “May have heard rustling in the bushes before I saw the shadows against the wall. But not on—fog. There was mist or fog along the grass and walkway on my way out. Didn’t remember seeing it when I got to her place after work.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Sam said.</p><p>The wind gusted again. Lightning arced across the sky, like a pulsing vein in the darkness, followed by a rolling crash of thunder. For a moment the streetlights went dark as far as they could see. Then they flickered fitfully back on.</p><p>“Oh, man...” Hanes said, staring at his car and the Dodge pickup. “How do I explain this to my insurance company?”</p><p>“Worry about that tomorrow,” Sam said. “Find shelter before they come back.”</p><p>“Jeez!” said the guy. “You think?”</p><p>Dean steered the Impala into the professional building complex. Once he neared the entrance, he had only to follow the flashing red and blue lights. A patrol car, an ambulance, and a wrecker were parked in a rough half-circle around the crime scene—although an attack by a giant tarantula could hardly be called a crime. Make that an incident scene.</p><p>A pair of confused EMTs—a woman and a man— stood on either side of Officer Jeffries, as if awaiting instructions Two men stood near the wrecker, their fidgety body language betraying impatience or discomfort with the situation. The taller of the two wore a baseball cap with an embroidered company logo over an apparently bald head; the other man had a shaggy mane of greasy hair.</p><p>“Trying to find a pattern here,” Sam said pensively. He seemed preoccupied with the Velociraptors’ attack rather than focusing on their present situation.</p><p>“Besides the white mist?” Dean asked. “And the nighttime? And giant lizards in general?”</p><p>“A tarantula isn’t a lizard,” Sam said, glancing up at Jeffries and the paramedics. “And the Velociraptors were big, but not gigantic.”</p><p>“Count your blessings.”</p><p>Dean swung around the emergency vehicles, and parked the Impala in the island of light under a lamppost. Finally, he saw what the paramedics and Jeffries had obstructed from view when he pulled into the lot.</p><p>“You see that?” he asked Sam.</p><p>“Human remains.”</p><p>“It’s... sticking out of the ground.”</p><p>Jeffries walked toward the Impala as they climbed out.</p><p>“Hey, guys,” he said. “Hope you got strong stomachs.”</p><p>He waved them toward the victim.</p><p>“What have we got?” Sam asked Jeffries.</p><p>“Victim was an adult male,” Jeffries said. He grabbed an evidence bag from the hood of his patrol car. “Harvey Dufford, according to the metal plate on what’s left of this emergency alert wristband we found beside the body, which no longer has any wrists to speak of.”</p><p>The upper torso—what remained of it, at least—looked as if it had been doused with highly corrosive acid. The head was little more than a crushed skull with a few strips of inflamed flesh around the neck. Most of the flesh on the arms and torso was gone, the internal organs missing or partially dissolved into a loose jellylike substance. With no ligaments to connect them, some of the bones had fallen in a loose circle around the torso. The man’s body seemed to end at his waist, but closer inspection revealed flesh and organs embedded in the asphalt of the parking lot.</p><p>“Where’s the giant tarantula?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Vanished.”</p><p>“Was my first guess. And we know it was a giant tarantula because...?”</p><p>“Marcus Epps, owner of the wrecker over there, brought his brother-in-law, Otis, here to retrieve his pickup truck, which is a few lots down from here. Soon as they turned into this lot, they saw the giant spider hunched over the victim. I told them to stick around. Figured you’d want a word.”</p><p>“Appreciate the cooperation, Jeffries... Hold on,” Dean said. He stepped back, crouched down and ran his hand along the surrounding blacktop. He felt ripples in the surface leading away from the remnants of the corpse. Even further away he found misshapen lumps merged with the asphalt. After a few moments, he identified the objects. “Running shoes.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Sam said. He walked from the embedded shoes toward the corpse. “From the ID and what’s left of his clothes, looks like he was jogging. Sees the giant tarantula, starts to run away, but then... sinks into the ground.”</p><p>“What? Giant tarantulas can melt asphalt?” Dean stared up at Sam. They knew weird, the brothers lived and breathed weird but this case was getting way beyond weird.</p><p>“Maybe Marcus and his brother-in-law know how this happened,” Sam suggested.</p><p>They walked over to the wrecker and the two men waiting there. The bald man’s cap advertised “Epps Service Center” in red script letters on a white field. That settled which one was Marcus.</p><p>Dean flashed his FBI laminate.</p><p>“Agent DeYoung. This is Agent Shaw. You saw a giant spider?”</p><p>Otis responded. “It was a red-kneed tarantula.”</p><p>“That sounds specific,” Sam said.</p><p>“Growing up, buddy of mine had one,” Otis said. “Fed it live crickets from the pet store. Let me watch.”</p><p>“And, as far as red-kneed tarantulas go, this one was big?”</p><p>“Hell, yeah!” Marcus said. “Thought it was a bear at first. Hunched over. My headlights swept over it, and I saw those red-striped legs.”</p><p>“Damn near had a heart attack,” Otis continued. “Doc keeps telling me my cholesterol is too high.”</p><p>“What happened?” Sam asked. “Exactly.”</p><p>“I could tell it was feeding,” Otis said. “Saw enough crickets eaten by my buddy’s tarantula. This thing had something wrapped up in its feelers while it went to work on it. Couldn’t tell what it was at first. You know, spiders can’t eat solid food. They digest it outside of their body then suck up the fluids.”</p><p>“Helluva way to check out,” Marcus said, shuddering.</p><p>“What happened next?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not much,” Marcus said. “Couple seconds after my headlights hit it, damn thing vanished. Poof! Like a magician’s trick. Thought maybe I’d imagined the whole damn thing. But, obviously, Otis saw it too.”</p><p>“After it disappeared,” Otis said. “That’s when I saw what it had been eating.”</p><p>“Don’t know what to make of it,” Marcus said. “Thought it ate the lower half. Then saw the guy stuck in the ground, like he was... planted there.”</p><p>Dean thanked them for their help, gave them his business card in case they remembered any other details. The men then piled into the wrecker and drove deeper into the series of linked parking lots to retrieve Otis’s pickup.</p><p>The Winchesters joined Jeffries and the paramedics near the impacted body.</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said. “Got what we need.”</p><p>“We want to talk to Lucy Quinn,” Sam said. “Apparently she witnessed the Lacosta hit and run.”</p><p>“Spoke to the chief. Said he was on his way there when he spotted you two at that sinkhole,” Jeffries said. He removed his cap and ran a hand through his hair, staring down at Dufford’s remains. “Nothing in the manuals or academy training about this sort of thing. We’re waiting on the county medical examiner, but...”</p><p>“We can’t move the body without construction equipment,” the woman paramedic said. “Jackhammer minimum.” She took a deep breath. “Christ!”</p><p>The other EMT scratched his jaw. “Maybe we should cover the body.”</p><p>“Better not,” Jeffries said. “Might contaminate evidence. Some of that flesh is liquid.” He looked toward Dean and Sam. “A word?”</p><p>The three of them took a few paces away from the paramedics. Jeffries turned down the volume on the radio clipped to his belt, reducing the police chatter to white noise.</p><p>“Listen,” Jeffries said and cleared his throat. “When I heard about Shelly’s giant lizard before, well, I assumed he’d had a bit too much joy juice, you know?” He took a deep breath and sighed. When he spoke again, his voice was hushed. “Chief told us you Fibbies—sorry, Feds—think this might be terrorist-related. Some cell testing a kind of hallucinogen weapon, right?”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean before he spoke. “We had some information along those lines.”</p><p>“Right, so, a hallucinogen makes you see weird stuff. Giant lizard, headless horseman, okay, that fits.”</p><p>“Giant tarantula,” Dean said.</p><p>Jeffries snapped his fingers. “Exactly what I thought when this call came in! Another weird one. But—“ he looked back at the mostly dissolved body embedded three feet deep in asphalt—“that is not you or me seeing something. That is something.”</p><p>“And you want to know what that something is,” Sam said.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>“We don’t know yet,” Dean said. More or less the truth.</p><p>“There’s more here than we thought,” Sam added.</p><p>“Goes double for me,” Jeffries said as he turned to walk back toward the paramedics. “Hell, triple!”</p><p>The Winchesters headed back toward the Impala. Behind them, Dean heard Jeffries turn up the volume on his belt radio. A lot of squawking and excited chatter. With the sinkhole and subsequent explosions, the car crash and Velociraptor attack, the brewing lightning storm, and who knew what else, the police were on high alert and apparently unprepared for the chaos befalling their sleepy little town. But two words stood out in the stream of reports and assignments.</p><p>Dean stopped, turned toward Jeffries.</p><p>“She did not just say Nazi zombies?” he called.</p><p>Jeffries looked over at him. “So you heard it too?”</p><p>“On Main Street?”</p><p>Jeffries threw up his hands in surrender.</p><p>“Why the hell not?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Ignoring posted speed limits, Dean raced the Impala east along Bell Street, reluctantly tapping the brake pedal as he rolled through each red traffic light. No guarantee the Velociraptors hadn’t returned to hunt another car and driver. He shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“This is what I meant,” Sam said. “This is all wrong.”</p><p>“You mean the Harvey Dufford smoothie back there? Or the Dead Snow sequel on Main Street?”</p><p>“Everything.”</p><p>“I’m not arguing.”</p><p>“Those Velociraptors don’t match current fossil records,” Sam said. “Real Velociraptors were smaller.”</p><p>“So are tarantulas and Gila monsters.”</p><p>“They had feathers.”</p><p>“Tarantulas?”</p><p>“Velociraptors,” Sam said. “More birdlike than reptilian.” Dean nodded. “So we rule out wormholes and time travel.”</p><p>“Along with the return of the Third Reich.”</p><p>“You got a theory?”</p><p>“These... manifestations are real,” Sam said. “But inaccurate.”</p><p>“I’m listening.”</p><p>“They’re more like perceptions,” Sam continued. “Or misconceptions.”</p><p>“Put it that way,” Dean said. “Sounds like a tulpa.”</p><p>“Dozens of tulpas?” Sam suggested and dismissed the idea with a shake of his head. “No, I don’t see how—“</p><p>“FBI? You there?” said a familiar voice punctuated by an electronic squawk.</p><p>Sam pulled the two-way radio from his pocket. “Shelly?”</p><p>“Couple of cars drag-racing west on Welker,” Shelly said. “Thought you should know. Least I think they’re drag racing.”</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>Dean shook his head. “Don’t look at me. He’s your deputy.”</p><p>“Thanks, Shelly.”</p><p>“Actually, they might be driving under the influence, weaving all over the road like that.”</p><p>Sam leaned forward, intent now. “Where are you?”</p><p>“Near the restaurant district, of course!”</p><p>“Did I hear screaming in the background?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Restaurants... He’s a block or two from Main.”</p><p>“Shelly, listen to me,” Sam said urgently. “Get away from there.”</p><p>“Whoa, lady,” Shelly said as the sound of a screaming woman passed by his mic. “What the hell are they supposed...”</p><p>“Shelly, get out of there!”</p><p>“Some kind of invasion. Soldiers. Nazis? They ain’t right.” Shelly’s breathing was ragged; they heard the rustling sounds of him running. “FBI, I’m sorry. I’m sorry! This ain’t for me. I quit!”</p><p>Sam tried the transmit button several times, rewarded with only silence.</p><p>“Don’t worry, man,” Dean said. “He got away. Probably tossed your radio down a sewer—“</p><p>The Impala pulled to the side, buffeted by a savage gust of wind. Lightning flashed repeatedly, revealing a thick mass of thunderheads. Then a jagged lightning bolt struck a corner lot, hammering a cottonwood with an explosive crack. A large branch, split from the trunk, toppled sideways, crashing through the windows of a two-door garage.</p><p>A couple blocks farther east, a curtain of heavy rain slashed across the Impala’s hood and pounded the windshield. Though Dean turned the wipers to their highest setting, he felt as if he were driving underwater. Smears of lights streaked across the safety glass and the world seemed to melt around them. Poor visibility forced him to decelerate to a crawl. For all he could tell, another sinkhole loomed a hundred feet ahead. Maybe a cliff. At this point, anything was possible.</p><p>Dean gripped the wheel and ploughed on.</p><p>Just when the downpour eased a little, another lightning bolt struck one block ahead of the Impala and skittered across all four lanes of Bell Street, finally blasting a freestanding mailbox. A shower of sparks erupted from the scorched box, which had been dislodged from its cement mooring. Flames flared through a twisted gap in the side of the box as letters and packages burned until doused by the unrelenting rain.</p><p>Dean loosened his white-knuckled hold on the steering wheel.</p><p>“That was close,” he said. The close encounters seemed to be stacking up.</p><p>Ahead, on their right, a searing white flash preceded a fiery explosion.</p><p>“Transformer hit,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean tried to blink away the afterimage of the lightning bolt from his retinas. The damaged wooden utility pole teetered toward the road. Engulfed in flame, the polemounted transformer at the top showered sparks like the world’s largest welder’s torch.</p><p>“Dean, it’s coming down!”</p><p>Burning at the top, severed near the base, the utility pole swung down toward the street, trailing snapped live wires. Dean floored the accelerator and swung the Impala into the oncoming lanes, which were, fortunately, empty. Glancing in the rearview mirror, he saw the pole come to rest in the middle of the road, still burning and spitting sparks in every direction.</p><p>“That was closer,” Sam said.</p><p>“This storm have a personal grudge?”</p><p>They passed a street sign for Arcadia Boulevard on the right, one block before Main Street. Dean looked ahead into the rainy night, made more difficult by a dead row of streetlights. Sam turned in his seat, looking back down Arcadia.</p><p>“Hold up,” Sam said. “They’ve reached the row of restaurants back there.”</p><p>“You saw them? Actual Nazi zombies?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “At least a half-dozen hungry zombies looking to dine on the diners.”</p><p>The repeated booms and ongoing rumble of the thunderstorm woke Roman Messerly. He experienced a few moments of disorientation as he took in his surroundings. His head rested on the pillow, but his bedcovers were relatively undisturbed. And he still wore his EMT uniform. Last thing he remembered was going off duty, driving home. After that, his memory was a blur.</p><p>Pressing his forearm across his forehead, he closed his eyes.</p><p>Not quite a blur. He remembered exhaustion sweeping over him as he entered his townhome. He’d skipped preparing a small meal for himself, instead heading for the bedroom. For some reason, he thought he’d take a nap and then eat something... before going to sleep? Made no sense to him. Usually he had trouble sleeping, which he attributed to drinking coffee nonstop during his waking hours. Occupational hazard. His job entailed long periods of boredom punctuated by short periods of action, the aftermath of mayhem visited upon others. His actions could mean life or death for somebody, so he tried to remain alert at all times. Accidents were caused by carelessness, and he could not afford a moment of distraction.</p><p>Some nights he tossed and turned for hours—probably sweating out the last dregs of caffeine—before he fell asleep. And he was not a heavy sleeper. He kept his pager and cell phone close to the bed. Never knew when they might need him. Sometimes he dreamed the pager was buzzing. He’d wake up and grab it only to find it quiet and still in his hands. Rare was the night he slept more than three hours in a row or five hours total.</p><p>Lethargic, he forced himself to climb out of bed and walk to the window. To the west, he saw the lights of downtown. And stretches of darkness marking a power outage. Flashes of lightning opened the black sky, revealing masses of angry clouds. As he stood there, he thought about how comfortable the bed had been. It pulled him like a gravity well. At that moment, he wanted nothing more than to sleep for ten hours straight. He had almost convinced himself to give in to the unnatural exhaustion when he saw the lightning strike and heard the boom. From experience, he thought a polemounted transformer had been hit. Above the trees, a flare of fire illuminated the night. Looked to him like Bell Street.</p><p>Hurrying to his bed, he reached for his pager and cell phone and experienced a moment of dizziness. Again the urge to climb into bed and sleep it off hit him. He teetered on the moment of indecision, weighing duty against personal weakness. Lightning flashes bathed his bedroom in stark, shifting shadows. For a moment, the shadows over his bed seemed to slide and race across the wall, as if with a mind of their own. Then the room plunged into darkness and he attributed the strange motion to tricks of the weird lighting.</p><p>His pager vibrated, shimmying across the tabletop.</p><p>When he checked the display, he saw he had five queued messages.</p><p>Strange that he hadn’t heard it once.</p><p>The cell phone display lit up. A quick check revealed he had received several calls and a half-dozen text messages. As he walked out of his bedroom, he shook his head in disbelief. Nothing like this had ever happened to him before.</p><p>Must have slept like the dead to miss all those alerts, he thought.</p><p>Unfortunately, it hadn’t helped. He was exhausted.</p><p>“Hold on.”</p><p>Dean checked the oncoming lanes and his side view mirror before spinning the steering wheel hard left, while accelerating, making a sweeping three-sixty turn to loop back to Arcadia Boulevard and dart down the wide street until he had a visual on the World War II-era zombies. He parked in a loading zone in front of Mama Ferracci, an Italian restaurant.</p><p>While Dean parked illegally, Sam released the partially spent magazine from his automatic and replaced it with a full one.</p><p>The rain had eased to a light shower.</p><p>Arcadia Boulevard sought a measure of old-world appeal with a row of ornamental horse-head hitching posts that alternated with faux-gas street lamps along the length of the sidewalk. Each storefront and restaurant had a different colored vinyl awning, and some businesses announced daily specials or sales on chalkboard sidewalk signs. Unfortunately, the proliferation of LCD parking meters conspired to spoil the turn of the twentieth-century illusion. Then again, add a dozen shambling Nazi zombies to any setting and you have more than enough anachronistic confusion.</p><p>As they exited the Impala, Dean looked over the roof of the car at Sam.</p><p>“What do you think? Silver stake through the heart?”</p><p>“No,” Sam said. “Perception is reality.”</p><p>“Ah,” Dean said. “Romero school. Headshots.”</p><p>Dean took a quick count of the zombies. No less than nine soldiers in green helmets and uniforms with black jackboots. An SS officer stood out in the black uniform, peaked cap with the SS eagle and a red armband with the black-andwhite swastika prominent. A graying field marshal also wore a peaked cap but with a full-length leather trench coat, while a younger officer wore a white summer tunic, stained with blood, due in large part to a gaping abdominal wound exposing a loop of intestines. All of them had blood caked around their mouths and on their hands. Impossible to know if they had appeared bloodied out of thin air, or if they had already begun snacking on the citizens of Clayton Falls.</p><p>Red and blue light pulsed from the light bars of two police cruisers parked at hurried angles farther down the street. Both cops—a burly man with dark hair and a pale face, and a trim blond woman in her mid-twenties—were slowly approaching the zombies with their guns drawn and braced with both hands, held down at a forty-five degree angle. Thankfully, the immediate area was clear of civilians. But Dean spotted frightened faces behind the glass doors and windows of several restaurants.</p><p>“Freeze!” the male cop yelled at the nearest undead soldier.</p><p>Ignoring his command, the soldier rammed his helmeted head into the glass door of a coffee shop decorated with a blue-and-white striped awning. The glass shattered and Dean heard startled screams coming from inside the building.</p><p>The cop fired a round into the back of the soldier, who immediately turned around and staggered toward him. One of the soldier’s eyes looked as if it had been clawed from the socket. As he lumbered toward the cop, the other police officer fired, hitting the zombie in the side, to little effect.</p><p>“Headshots!” Dean yelled.</p><p>Both cops immediately swiveled, turning their raised guns toward the Winchester brothers.</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“FBI!” Sam shouted, producing his laminate in one smooth motion while keeping his gun hand down at his side. “Agents Shaw and DeYoung.”</p><p>“Right,” the female officer said. She glanced at her fellow cop. “It’s okay, Cerasi. Chief mentioned them.”</p><p>“Affirmative,” Cerasi said, taking two steps back from the advancing zombie soldier. “You two know about this?”</p><p>“Headshots,” Dean said again. “Nothing else will stop them.”</p><p>“You’re serious?”</p><p>“And don’t let them bite you,” Sam warned.</p><p>Dean turned to him, eyebrow raised. “You think?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Perception is reality.”</p><p>During the back-and-forth conversation between the living, the young Nazi officer in the blood-stained white summer tunic with exposed intestines had worked his way behind the female cop. About two strides away from her, he stared hungrily at her exposed neck.</p><p>“Wild! Check your six!” Cerasi said.</p><p>Dean had closed the distance to the cops and had a bead on Summertime Nazi. He squeezed off a shot and watched as the zombie took the round through his right temple, his head whipping to the side. As he dropped to his knees and pitched forward, Officer Wild jumped back.</p><p>Beside Dean, Sam fired two rounds in quick succession. Two zombie soldiers teetered and fell—one with a neat hole in his forehead just above the bridge of his nose, the other losing rotted bits of brain matter after the back of his skull was blown away, along with the shattered remains of his helmet.</p><p>Cerasi sighted along his automatic and fired a shot at the first soldier, almost point blank. The zombie’s nose seemed to vaporize and the back of his neck exploded. As the zombie swayed on unreliable legs, Cerasi raised his foot and kicked him in the abdomen, knocking him to the ground, his helmet rattling around on the ground behind him. The zombie’s head twitched back and forth for a few seconds, until Cerasi stepped forward and put a bullet through his forehead.</p><p>The gray-haired Nazi field marshal in the full-length leather trench coat targeted Wild. With his mouth gaping and his chin resting on his chest, his red-rimmed eyes stayed as fixated on her as his outstretched arms and twitching fingers.</p><p>She took a step back, almost tripping over the dead zombie in the white tunic, then sidestepped and raised her firearm. “Stop!”</p><p>“Too damn civilized,” Dean scoffed. He raised his automatic.</p><p>Wild let the zombie take one more step before she pulled the trigger. Twice. One shot burst through the field marshal’s left eye, the other blew off his peaked cap and the top of his skull. His legs crumpled and he fell to the side.</p><p>The rest of the zombies shambled around the broken window of the coffee shop, trying to gain entrance. Somebody inside was shoving them back with a coat rack, but there were too many zombies to keep at bay. The soldier bearing the brunt of the coat hooks wrapped his arm around it and staggered sideways, dislodging the pole from the coffee shop patron’s hands.</p><p>The cops and the Winchesters rushed forward. Coming from the side, Sam had the best angle. If the cops fired at the zombies and missed, their rounds could maim or kill somebody inside the coffee shop. Dean’s line of sight was obstructed by Sam, so he stood ready, guarding Sam’s back.</p><p>Gun down at his side, Dean waited as Sam methodically delivered headshots to the soldiers, above the nose if they faced him, at the base of the neck if their backs were turned, behind the eyes if they stood in profile. If they twitched at all after falling to the ground, Cerasi or Wild came forward to deliver a coup de grâce.</p><p>While Dean had Sam’s back, he forgot nobody had his.</p><p>If not for a wet grunt too close to his ear, he might not have reacted in time.</p><p>He whirled around, leaning back to avoid a pale, bloody hand missing half its fingernails. The black-uniformed SS officer had emerged from behind one of the rain-streaked sidewalk signs. The zombie’s mouth was stretched impossibly wide, strands of bloody flesh lodged between chipped teeth, as it leaned forward to take a chunk out of Dean’s neck.</p><p>Before it winked out, the bedside lamp failed to dispel the coalescing oily shadows above Trevor Deetz’s sleeping body. A humanoid shape resolved from the roiling darkness. First the head with glowing red eyes appeared, followed by a torso and arms before the emergence of spindly legs and nascent clawed feet, gripping the headboard.</p><p>Unaware of the intruder in his bedroom, Trevor mumbled in his sleep, his brow damp with perspiration while his clammy left hand rested on the graphic novel he’d been reading before slipping into unconsciousness.</p><p>The dark shape above the bed reached out a shadow arm and placed its unnaturally long fingers on Trevor’s forehead. The face sculpted from the darkness sighed in pleasure as its fingers began to ease downward through the membrane of flesh and the armor of bone.</p><p>Trevor’s mumbling became agitated, the volume of his voice increasing. Beneath his eyelids, his eyes twitched furiously in accelerated REM sleep, while the muscles in his arms and legs shuddered as if experiencing repeated electrical shocks.</p><p>The graphic novel slipped from beneath his hand, exposing a lurid cover. In the foreground, a fleeing woman screamed. Behind her, a zombie in a black Nazi SS uniform with a bloodstained face had torn out the throat of a man in a business suit. The title of the book was splashed across the cover in oozing red letters: Hitler’s Zombie Force.</p><p>Trevor’s left arm rose from the blankets in a quick backhand motion, catching the edge of the graphic novel, which fell to the hardwood floor with a thud. At the sudden impact, Trevor became still. His eyes fluttered open and he stared at the ceiling. Noticing a slice of unusual darkness in his field of vision, he reached up and rubbed his eyes, then wiped away the film of perspiration on his brow.</p><p>While he was distracted, the solid darkness expanded, becoming vaporous, and retracted to the wall above his bed. When Trevor next opened his eyes, everything had returned to normal. Taking a deep breath, he sat up, looked around his room and swept his hands across the blankets, searching.</p><p>His bedside light flickered on, momentarily blinding him. That’s when he remembered. He’d been reading the graphic novel that included the first twelve issues of Hitler’s Zombie Force when he fell asleep. Couldn’t beat zombies for über gore factor. He thought it was awesome. Supposedly they were turning it into a movie, but his mom would never let him see it. She monitored his movie consumption like a hawk, but never looked twice at the stack of comics he brought home from Greg’s Comic Vault each Wednesday.</p><p>Even though his comic books flew under her maternal radar, Trevor wasn’t stupid enough to test her inattention. Anything with a gory cover he kept in his bedroom and read there. The best comics he read at night, right before going to sleep. Never when he should be studying, because she might choose the exact wrong time to check on him.</p><p>For a fleeting moment, he wondered if his mom had come into his room after he nodded off and confiscated the zombie book. That could explain the eerie sensation he’d had when he first woke up—the feeling that he wasn’t alone. He glanced at the door to check that it remained closed.</p><p>Shaking off the sense of being watched, he leaned over the right side of the bed and checked the floor. Nothing. Then he scanned the left side and saw the graphic novel on the ground, exactly where he must have dropped it. Mystery solved. Scooping it up, he stared at the cover for a few moments, deciding if he wanted to continue reading.</p><p>A powerful yawn interrupted his internal debate, so he had his answer. Setting the book down on the bedside table, he reached up and switched off the lamp. But he could hardly wait for tomorrow. The story had been getting good. Really bloody.</p><p>Dean fired a wild shot into the zombie SS officer’s chest in an attempt to gain some separation. If Sam was correct about perception being reality with these manifestations, Dean’s odds of survival were nonexistent if he suffered so much as a single skin-breaking nibble from the undead Nazi storm trooper. Backing up, Dean found himself pushed up against the glass storefront.</p><p>The zombie leaned forward, its ashen face contorted in equal parts rage and hunger, arms outstretched, fingers twitching in anticipation. Pink drool slipped from the side of its mouth.</p><p>Dropping to his knees, Dean raised his automatic in both hands and fired straight up along the line of the zombie’s torso. The round caught it under the chin, piercing the soft palate and the roof of the mouth to burrow into its brain. The Nazi’s head whipped backward, his black peaked cap sailing to the sidewalk. Dean fired a second round for good measure and turned his head aside as the Nazi’s face erupted in a misty pink shower of gore.</p><p>How dumb am I? Dean wondered. Avoid the lethal bite by creating an infectious mist he couldn’t help but inhale. Genius.</p><p>But his concern proved unwarranted. A moment after the second bullet struck home, the SS officer, along with all remnants of his presence, either solid or aerosolized, winked out of existence.</p><p>“They’re gone,” Officer Wild said, marveling. “How the hell do they just disappear?”</p><p>“Same way they appeared,” Sam said.</p><p>“And how’s that?” Cerasi asked.</p><p>“Hell if I know.”</p><p>“But we’re working on it,” Dean added as he climbed to his feet, figuring it was his turn to trot out the company line.</p><p>For the first time, he noticed how all the stores and restaurants along the street displayed large black ribbons, wreaths with black bows, or photos of victims of the garment factory fire. Every time these people went out to shop or eat, they saw reminders of the tragedy. Not for the first time, Dean wondered if there was a connection between the tragic fire and the weird manifestations occurring all over Clayton Falls.</p><p>“Not a single body,” Wild said, scanning the sidewalk, which moments before had zombie corpses piled like cordwood. “Suppose that means less paperwork.”</p><p>With the undead threat gone, people were streaming out of nearby restaurants and stores, looking around in shock and disbelief. More than a few probably decided they had imagined the whole episode. Some probably vowed to give up their drink or controlled substance of choice. The rest, no doubt, just wanted to hop in their cars and rush home.</p><p>As the coffee shop door swung open and several patrons pushed their way out, Dean held out his hands.</p><p>“Wait!” he said. “Stop them.”</p><p>Since he held a handgun in one of his outstretched hands, everyone paused mid-flight.</p><p>“What?” Cerasi asked, confused.</p><p>Sam caught Dean’s eyes and nodded. “He’s right. We need to check them.”</p><p>“For what?” Wild asked.</p><p>“Bites,” Dean said.</p><p>“You can’t be serious,” Cerasi said. “These people just survived...”</p><p>“What?” Dean said. “You want to say it? Or should I?”</p><p>“Zombies?” Wild said as if speaking the word incurred a hefty fine. “But they’re gone.”</p><p>“Now,” Sam said. “Two minutes ago, they were here.”</p><p>Dean realized the two cops were discounting what they had witnessed, what they had participated in. They had both put down Nazi zombies a few minutes ago and were acting as if none of it mattered because the evidence had vanished.</p><p>“He’s bleeding,” a middle-aged woman said shrilly. “He was fighting them with that hat rack and now he’s bleeding!”</p><p>Everyone in the crowd backed away from the man she indicated.</p><p>Dean glanced down and saw blood dripping from the man’s closed fist.</p><p>“Show us,” Sam said grimly.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” the man said nervously. He had thinning hair, wore a black turtleneck under a brown suit jacket with faded jeans. Looked like a harmless college professor. No matter how innocuous he looked now, if he’d been infected, he was a danger to anyone within biting distance. “I—I cut my hand on the glass.”</p><p>“Then you won’t mind if we take a look.”</p><p>The man hesitated.</p><p>In unison, Dean and Sam raised their handguns. At this range, between the two of them, they were guaranteed of at least one headshot.</p><p>“Wait!” Wild said. “This is crazy.”</p><p>“Crazy night,” Dean said.</p><p>Cerasi raised his hands. “He’s not—he’s not like those other things.”</p><p>“Not yet,” Sam said.</p><p>“You can’t just shoot him!” Wild said.</p><p>“Second he goes zombie-eyed,” Dean said coldly. “Watch me.”</p><p>“Okay. Okay,” the man said. He raised his right arm, showing them his hand, wrapped in a bloodstained white handkerchief. Slowly, he removed the cloth and exposed the wound.</p><p>Dean glanced down at the man’s palm. A nasty cut crossing from the middle of the palm to the skin above the thumb. As the man patted the welling blood, the smooth edges of the wound were apparent.</p><p>Dean lowered his gun. “You should have that looked at.”</p><p>“Thanks,” the man said and rewrapped his hand.</p><p>Everyone in the crowd visibly relaxed.</p><p>“Show of hands,” Sam said.</p><p>One by one, the patrons raised their hands for inspection. Dean made a quick visual check of all exposed skin, including necks, arms and legs, buoyed by the fact that none of the zombies had entered the shop. Only the people who’d stood closest to the windows had been at risk. In the end, they were told to go home, leaving the Winchesters with the two bemused cops.</p><p>“You really thought somebody could have been... infected?” Wild asked.</p><p>“Can’t be too careful,” Dean said.</p><p>“We don’t know what we’re dealing with yet,” Sam added in a more reasonable tone. “We have to view these... attacks as potentially lethal. In any number of ways.”</p><p>“The report we heard placed the zombies on Main Street,” Dean said. “Anybody check there?”</p><p>“We followed them here,” Cerasi said. “The municipal building area is usually quiet this late at night. Though now and then you’ll find mourners leaving flowers, cards, or stuffed animals at the memorial.”</p><p>“Most pedestrian traffic ends up here later in the evening,” Wild said. “Around the restaurants and the shops with late hours.”</p><p>“How can we be sure we got them all?” Cerasi asked.</p><p>“Any others probably disappeared with the main group,” Sam said. “But De—Agent DeYoung and I will drive by before we leave to interview some other witnesses.”</p><p>“Not necessary,” Wild said. “That’s our job. Right, Cerasi?”</p><p>Cerasi nodded.</p><p>Dean exchanged a look with Sam and saw they were in silent agreement. Now that Sam had his soul restored, they were in tune with each other again. Dean no longer had to guess at Sam’s motives and ruthless—bordering on sociopathic—approach to hunting. They would continue to check the site of any manifestation even if the Clayton Falls PD thought they had everything under control.</p><p>With a quick peck on the cheek, Phil Meyerson’s wife had left him sitting in his usual spot at the end of the sofa, under the light from the table lamp as he worked to finish the daily New York Times crossword. The puzzle was his last mental exercise of the day, something he hoped would keep his aging mind healthy. “Use it or lose it,” as he often told his wife. And the last thing he wanted to lose was his mind.</p><p>Tuned to a national all-news channel, the television was muted while he worked on the puzzle. Now and then he would glance up and read the news crawl to make sure he wasn’t missing anything important.</p><p>The later the hour, the more often he checked the television screen. No escaping the fact that he was old and getting older. And as much as he tried to keep his mind nimble, his body failed him more often lately and he succumbed to simple physical fatigue. He would nod off with the crossword halffinished and if he awoke before morning, he’d stubbornly pick up where he left off, plugging away. That pattern had become so familiar, his wife’s calm acceptance of it came as a surprise. Soon he would have to change his habit. Tackle the puzzle earlier in the day. Or give it up altogether.</p><p>Retirement had been difficult for him to accept. In all his years at the CDC, he depended daily on his mental faculties. Puttering around the house and garden seemed like a waste of any talents and skills he had ever possessed. Where were the challenges? Where were the goals?</p><p>He’d thought about teaching at a university, if one would have him. But he hadn’t kept up with the journals and research and the cutting-edge science. His eyes lacked the stamina for all the reading and he seemed to need stronger eyeglass prescriptions every six months. Lines of text would blur and his eyes would tear with the effort.</p><p>Staring at the crossword clues and the tiny boxes for an hour or more started his eyes burning. He rubbed them for the twentieth time, glanced at the news crawl text he’d read six times already, or was it seven. Political posturing, fluctuating stock prices, banking regulations, civil unrest in the Middle East... Everything seemed to merge into a monotonous string of the same old news recycled again. No exotic diseases or viral outbreaks or global influenza pandemics. Nothing to remind him of the past, when he had a purpose...</p><p>He tilted his head back against the sofa cushions and closed his eyes. For a few moments, his burning eyes experienced exquisite relief. The cooling sensation was so welcome, he decided to leave his eyes closed for a few minutes more, then he would continue...</p><p>Darkness descended from the ceiling, creeping along the wall to hover near Meyerson’s head. Where the lamplight fell against the thickening shadows, it was absorbed, unable to penetrate the darkness taking shape. Unable to break apart the arm or long fingers that reached for Phil Meyerson’s forehead.</p><p>Meyerson slept and the darkness began to feed.</p><p>As Dean drove slowly down Main Street, Sam pointed to the lone mourner standing near the curved wall of the garment factory memorial, head bowed.</p><p>“Should we ask if he’s seen any zombies?”</p><p>“If he saw zombies,” Dean said, “he’d be long gone.”</p><p>“Slow down,” Sam said.</p><p>“What is it?” Dean asked, but then noticed it himself.</p><p>The man was trembling, twitching where he stood. Possibly overcome with emotion, remembering a lost loved one. But Dean’s gut told him something else was at work. He eased the Impala to the curb and switched off the engine.</p><p>“Could be he’s infected,” Dean said. “If he is...”</p><p>“Perception is reality,” Sam said, nodding. “Worst case scenario. He’s a goner.”</p><p>“We do this,” Dean said. “Kill a civilian. We’ve turned a corner.”</p><p>“I know,” Sam said grimly and stepped out of the car, gun in hand.</p><p>Soulless Sam wouldn’t have a problem pulling the trigger. Hell, he’d shoot first and ask questions later, Dean thought. This one might be on Dean. He’d have to be prepared.</p><p>Dean followed Sam, gun drawn, and together they approached the man.</p><p>“FBI,” Dean said. “We’d like a word.”</p><p>“Help me,” the man whispered harshly.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Sam said. “Mister, are you okay?”</p><p>The man turned toward them with pained precision, as if coordinating his muscles for that simple task required extreme effort. His head rose from his chest and he stared at them with bloodshot eyes, which seemed to lack a pupil. Blood trickled from his ears, nose and mouth. An inflamed red rash covered every square inch of his exposed skin, as if all the blood in his body wanted to vacate the premises as soon as possible.</p><p>The Winchesters stopped in their tracks, stared.</p><p>The man raised a hand toward them and his fingers dripped blood.</p><p>In a voice harsh with pain, he gasped, “Help me!”</p><p>When he blinked, tears of blood streamed down his cheeks.</p><p>“Buddy, what happened to you?” Sam asked, keeping his distance.</p><p>“I need help!”</p><p>The man staggered toward them.</p><p>Sam and Dean raised their guns.</p><p>“That’s far enough,” Dean said.</p><p>The man stopped walking toward them, but he continued to twitch.</p><p>“He’s not a zombie, Dean.”</p><p>“Looks like a friggin’ blood grenade.”</p><p>From the opposite direction, a police cruiser approached. The light bar came on, but not the sirens. The cruiser swung across two lanes of traffic and parked on the shoulder on the opposite side of the memorial.</p><p>“It’s Officer Blondie,” Dean said.</p><p>“Wild,” Sam said. As she approached, Sam called. “We meet again!”</p><p>“And you two with your guns on a civilian,” Wild said.</p><p>“Is he?” Dean called. “One of yours?”</p><p>“Of course, he...” She stopped talking as she walked toward the man in a wide arc with her hand on the butt of her holstered sidearm. “Sir? What’s your name?”</p><p>He looked at her and coughed when he tried to speak.</p><p>Blood sprayed from his mouth in a fine mist. Wild backed away instinctively.</p><p>“What is this?” she asked.</p><p>“He’s infected,” Sam cautioned. “Something nasty. Ebola. Hemorrhagic fever. Marburg virus.”</p><p>“You have to help ME!” the man cried, hysterical.</p><p>Turning back to Sam, the man lumbered toward him, arms outstretched.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Blood coursed down the infected man’s face, spilling from his ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. When he was within ten feet of Sam, his body became wracked with a coughing spasm and blood sprayed from his mouth. Stiff-legged, he continued to stumble toward the brothers.</p><p>“Stop!” Sam warned him, his jaw bunching as he tightened his grip on the trigger.</p><p>“Hell with that,” Dean said and fired.</p><p>The bullet struck the man above the left eye, whipping his head back. His body collapsed in a tangle of legs—and winked out of existence before reaching the pavement. All the spilled blood vanished as well.</p><p>Sam turned to Dean. “How did you know he wasn’t real?”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Dean said. “Your rules. Perception and reality.”</p><p>Wild joined them. “That could have been one of my people!”</p><p>“Either way,” Sam said with a nod to Dean. “He was infected and lethal. Ninety percent mortality rate.”</p><p>“Ten percent chance he could have lived,” Wild countered.</p><p>“You willing to turn your town into a hot zone?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Not my call.”</p><p>“Whatever this is,” Sam interrupted before the argument could escalate. “Whatever creates these manifestations, I doubt it plays the percentages. You get infected, you die.”</p><p>“So what are we supposed to do?”</p><p>“Shoot on sight,” Dean said. “Lethal force.”</p><p>As he slept at the end of the sofa, mired in a troubling dream, Phil Meyerson’s hand slipped and he jabbed his thigh with his mechanical pencil. The sudden movement, more than the injury to his leg, woke him from what had started out as a break to rest his burning eyes and had turned into sound sleep. His eyes opened to darkness and he experienced a moment of disorientation. A few seconds later, the lamp flickered and winked on, followed by the television set. He assumed the house had experienced a short power loss while he’d been asleep.</p><p>Glancing down at the half-finished New York Times crossword, he sighed in self-disgust and slapped it down on the end table and placed the mechanical pencil on top of it. “Damn old age,” he muttered.</p><p>He leaned over the coffee table and pressed the remote button to turn off the television set. Then, with another sigh, he pushed himself from the comfortable embrace of the sofa. Six months ago, he would have battled on with the crossword. Hell, one month ago, he’d have been game to keep plugging along. But not now.</p><p>“Not tonight,” he whispered in quiet surrender.</p><p>For some reason, his physical exhaustion would not be denied. Maybe he was coming down with something. A bug incubating, draining his stamina, what little he had at his age. Nothing like the exotic diseases he had studied his whole life. Just some common, garden variety virus staking its claim, challenging his immune system to a duel.</p><p>In a way, the conjecture made him feel better. Anybody could become sick, need more rest than usual. Not necessarily a sign of advanced age or deteriorating faculties. If he had to rest, he would. But was it asking too much for some dreamless sleep? As much as he missed his youth, he wouldn’t mind a night’s sleep without dreaming about deadly viral outbreaks.</p><p>Switching off the table lamp, he made his slow way up the stairs, hearing his joints creak and pop like rusty hinges, pressing down on the banister rail with his palm because he needed the support to make the simple trip to his bedroom and his sleeping wife.</p><p>In the dark room he left behind, a deeper darkness detached from the wall and drifted across the open space, spilling out through a keyhole and then through a small gap between the edge of the storm door and the doorjamb. Once out in the night, it floated above the rooftops in a familiar direction and paused above another house before drifting down, ready to feed again before the night was over.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Alden Webb, sitting in bed in his pajamas, yawned as he flipped through assorted internal prison documents. He turned the television to a nighttime talk show host whose monologue patter became like white noise filling the unnatural silence of the house. Thunderstorms had passed and the sirens he’d heard earlier had faded. Car accidents, downed power lines, the usual heartbeat of town emergencies in severe weather, he presumed. Nothing to concern him. But even with all those distracting sounds outside the house, he could never acclimate to the silence inside the house.</p><p>Ever since his wife divorced him and moved to San Francisco to work for her niece—who founded a company that helped corporations develop social networking strategies—he swore he could hear the clocks in the house ticking. And the sound was enough to drive him to distraction—or a psych ward. He found himself turning on the stereo or the television as soon as he returned home. Background noise. Because the silence was too loud.</p><p>What the talk show host joked about was of little interest to him, but it trumped the hollowness of ticking clocks and humming electronics. Instead, Webb flipped through the file folders filled with routine paperwork and incident reports from his deputy wardens, the food service supervisor, his corrections center manager, the director of security operations, and the building manager. The reports dealt with everything under his purview, including food preparation, counseling, treatment, health care, security issues, purchase orders, human resources matters involving prison employees, and building maintenance. Most of the reports were standard administrative matters. He looked for irregularities in the routine reports. And he paid special attention to matters involving prisoner treatment by the guards and violence or insubordination among the prisoners.</p><p>His early conversation with the young FBI agents had not been unexpected. Defending the safety of the prison had become something of a knee-jerk reaction for him. Nevertheless, he took his responsibilities as warden of a federal prison seriously. While he assured the mayor and the citizens of Clayton Falls that Falls Federal presented no threat to their welfare, any prison was a potential powder keg. One large-scale riot and all his careful assurances would be undone.</p><p>The addition of the supermax wing had been a sore point for the town, a rallying cry for all the protestors who decried the housing of the “worst of the worst” criminals minutes away from the families and children of Clayton Falls. In reality, the supermax cons were the least of Webb’s concerns. They were locked down in solitary cells twenty-three hours a day. And their one free hour out of their cells was spent alone. Not much trouble for them to get into with that one hour of exercise time.</p><p>Truth be told, he had a visceral loathing of the supermax felons. In his opinion, they were beyond redemption or rehabilitation. They were marking time, lifers or awaiting lethal injection. Webb had a hard time looking them in the eye, because what he saw there struck him as inhuman. Maybe it was the total lack of compassion or conscience. Something was just... missing. The latest addition had been particularly heinous: Ragnar Bartch, a confessed cannibal with seventeen known victims and whose weapon of choice was a cleaver. Before he arrived, the worst con in supermax was Kurt Machalek, who kept a collection of human hearts in mason jars after cutting them from the chests of his victims with a serrated bowie knife. Profilers called the hearts souvenirs. Machalek called them totems and believed they gave him mystical powers. But Bartch and Machalek and their ilk weren’t going anywhere.</p><p>All the other prisoners under his watch had much more potential to cause trouble. They had far less direct supervision and oversight. They mingled. They divided themselves along racial lines, us versus them. One spark, one real or imagined slight and they could cause serious injury to their fellow cons and damage to the prison. Yet even the worst-case scenario presented no threat to the town. Even a full-blown riot could be locked down. Yes, there most likely would be casualties in the prison—but the town would remain safe. Guards and prison employees would be the only civilians at risk.</p><p>Webb shuddered with a sudden draft in his bedroom. He was not poetic enough to consider the sensation a presentiment of doom. He read nothing in the reports that hinted at anything more than the expected amount of conflict within the walls of his prison. Everything was, well, routine.</p><p>Acquiescing to the frequency of his yawns, he filed the reports in their folders and stacked them on the bedside table to take to work in the morning. He picked up the television remote, trying to decide if he should turn the volume up or turn the set off. While he weighed the pros and cons, he fell asleep.</p><p>Coils of darkness unspooled from the curtains and settled above his headboard, taking shape to feed...</p><p>By the time Dean and Sam arrived at the scene of Tony Lacosta’s hit and vanish, the young man’s body had been taken away, and the front yard and wrecked porch had been encircled with crime scene tape. His parents stood in the driveway in their night clothes, arms wrapped around each other. While his mother sobbed, his father looked as if he’d been kicked in the gut. They had already told Chief Quinn what they’d witnessed after the initial attack twice and refused to go over it again. The Winchesters eavesdropped on the conversation as a detective that Quinn assigned to the case promised to talk to them in the morning, after they’d had a chance to process what had happened. Dean doubted their “processing” would adhere to a convenient timetable.</p><p>At the curb in front of the house, Lucy Quinn argued quietly with her father. The police chief ‘s concern for his daughter was evident in his eyes and body language, but clearly he found her account of the attack unconvincing. In deference to the grieving parents standing less than twenty feet away, Chief Quinn and Lucy spoke in hushed but urgent tones.</p><p>“Why would I make this up?” Lucy demanded.</p><p>“You wouldn’t,” Chief Quinn said. “Not intentionally. I’m suggesting you didn’t see what you think you saw. A car might roll down a hill unattended, but they simply don’t drive themselves.”</p><p>“This one did,” Lucy said. “Saw it with my own eyes.”</p><p>“Eyewitnesses are notoriously inaccurate,” the police chief countered. “Three people witness the same crime. Later, they’ll each give completely different descriptions of the perp. And they’re all positive about what they saw.”</p><p>“So, you’re saying you don’t believe it was Teddy’s car?”</p><p>“Teddy’s car was totaled, Lucy. You know that.”</p><p>“Then it was an exact copy.”</p><p>“Now we’re getting somewhere. Somebody—a real person, not a ghost or an invisible driver—got hold of a similar car. Maybe even painted on the white stripe.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“An old friend, maybe,” Chief Quinn suggested. “Out for revenge.”</p><p>Lucy placed her hands on her hips and stared at him. “You know how crazy that sounds?”</p><p>Chief Quinn scoffed in frustration. “Any crazier than a car driving itself around town, running down civilians?”</p><p>“You’re impossible.”</p><p>Dean stepped up during the awkward silence.</p><p>“Mind telling us what you saw. Or didn’t see,” he asked Lucy, with a quick glance at her father.</p><p>“Why bother?” Chief Quinn said. “There’s a simple explanation. A tinted windshield hid the driver from view.”</p><p>“The windshield was not tinted!” Lucy glanced at Tony’s parents as she spoke, trying to keep her voice under control.</p><p>Chief Quinn threw his hands up in the air.</p><p>Lucy turned to Dean. “He’s right. What’s the point? I already told him what I saw. He refuses to listen.”</p><p>“We—Agent Shaw and I—might be open to different possibilities.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” Chief Quinn asked indignantly, as if Dean had called his judgment and entire law enforcement background into question.</p><p>“Have you been listening to your police reports, Chief?” Dean asked. “Giant spiders, Nazi zombies in the restaurant district, packs of hunting dinosaurs. You saw the sinkhole deep enough to hold a gymnasium.”</p><p>Quinn shook his head. “Crazy talk. If I hadn’t been tied up here with this terrible accident... Well, let’s just say I’m now willing to believe your information about a hallucinogen was credible. Clearly, some people in Clayton Falls have been dosed. It’s the only explanation for all the irrational radio chatter. As far as the sinkhole, that’s all it was. Bigger than most, I’ll grant, but they happen.”</p><p>“Mind if we have a word with your daughter?” Sam asked in a reasonable tone. Dean always figured Sam had the better chance of making it in the world of politics.</p><p>“No, go right ahead,” he said. “I love her, but her fantasy story is not helping the situation.”</p><p>Chief Quinn walked brusquely to his police cruiser, climbed in and slammed the door. He brought the police radio to his mouth and spoke rapidly into it. Dean watched as the chief began to listen to more reports from his officers. Within seconds he was shaking his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Lucy, tell us what happened,” Sam said gently. “Were you here when the car hit Tony?”</p><p>“No,” she said. “It started before that. I had already left his house. I was walking home when the car... saw me.”</p><p>“Saw you?” Sam asked.</p><p>The possessed car talk made Dean nervous. He glanced at the Impala parked at the curb, willing it to stay silent and dark. He took a breath and refocused on the conversation.</p><p>“That’s what it felt like. I believe it was coming for Tony,” she said. “But it saw me and decided to take a swipe at me. So, maybe it was thinking, two-for-one, right? First Lucy, then Tony.”</p><p>“How so?”</p><p>“About the same time I saw the car, it drove to my side of the street, jumped the curb and tried to run me down. I froze for a moment. Kept thinking, this can’t be happening. But I remembered that it had happened, that it got Steve.”</p><p>“What did you do?”</p><p>“I snapped out of it. I was standing next to a white picket fence. Fortunately, it wasn’t too high. I dove over it to get out of the way. The car hit the fence, pretty much wrecked the whole thing. I can show you if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>“I believe you.”</p><p>Lucy smiled in relief.</p><p>Probably the first she’s heard those words all night, Dean thought. “So, the car kept driving. Back the way I had come. Toward Tony’s house. Since it had already got Steve, and tried for me, I thought maybe it’s going after Tony next. When I left his house, he was out on the porch. I wanted to warn him. Thought he’d be safe as long as he didn’t come down to the sidewalk or try to cross the street. I had no idea it would drive up on the lawn and... and ram the porch.”</p><p>Dean scanned the ruined front lawn, scored with deep tire ruts, the sagging midsection of the porch and the overturned Adirondack chairs. It had been easier to imagine the car hitting someone standing in the middle of the road. Aside from the last-second acceleration to hit Steve Bullinger, the hit and run fit the profile of an accident. This attack was... premeditated. The car had known where Tony Lacosta lived, had sought him out and used every means at its vehicular disposal to kill him.</p><p>“The car jumped the curb and struck the porch?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “First it turned to face the house. Then it went right over the curb and slammed into the porch. Over and over until the porch collapsed. Tony fell onto the lawn. Once he was at ground level, the car... it crushed him.” She pressed her wrist against her mouth and started to cry quietly.</p><p>Sam placed his hands gently on her shoulders and looked her in the eyes.</p><p>“Lucy, I’m sorry about your friend. I know this is hard.”</p><p>She nodded quickly and a tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>“Why is this happening?”</p><p>At the risk of losing her trust, Dean said, “Lucy, can you think of anyone who might want to hurt you and your friends? Because of Teddy’s death?”</p><p>“Revenge? Like my father said?”</p><p>“I’m not saying what you saw isn’t real,” Dean said quickly. “But maybe somebody caused it to happen.”</p><p>“We were Teddy’s closest friends,” Lucy said, genuinely puzzled. “His only friends in school.”</p><p>“What about family?” Dean recalled Sam’s reading newspaper articles about the accident. “Lived with his grandmother, right?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Olga Kucharski.”</p><p>Lucy shook her head. “Mrs. Kucharski is an old woman. Other than grocery shopping, she never leaves her house.”</p><p>“You on good terms with her?”</p><p>“Not really,” Lucy said. “I mean, she never really approved of us hanging around with her grandson. And she dismissed my relationship with Teddy as a crush. Thought it would pass. But she knew we were his only friends.</p><p>“After the accident, I visited her a couple times, but it was just... too much, you know. I couldn’t handle her grief and my grief. Because, after Teddy died, I couldn’t breathe in that house. Felt like it was crushing me. I’ll never forget what happened, but it’s... easier without the constant reminders. Last few months, I haven’t really seen her. Or made an effort. Guess that makes me a bad person.”</p><p>“Everybody handles grief in their own way,” Sam said.</p><p>“I know,” she said. “But I still feel guilty.”</p><p>“You should go home,” Sam said pointedly.</p><p>“No, I’m okay,” Lucy said. She glanced toward the Lacostas, still huddled together in their driveway, whispering to each other. “Maybe I should stay with them...”</p><p>“It’s not safe here,” Dean said. “You’re not safe here.”</p><p>She looked up at Sam and then at Dean. “You think it will come back?”</p><p>Sam cleared his throat. “Definite possibility.”</p><p>“We could drive you home,” Dean said.</p><p>“Thanks, but—“ she glanced over at her father’s police cruiser—“I should go with my father.”</p><p>“You’re okay with that?” Sam asked.</p><p>“If I’m not safe with the chief of police, I’m not safe with anyone.”</p><p>Dean frowned but said nothing. He’d feel better about her safety with her dad if the man actually believed in what was trying to kill her and had already killed her friends. The car might be a blind spot for him. Until it was too late.</p><p>Taking out one of his FBI business cards, Dean handed it to her.</p><p>“That has my cell number. If anything—and I mean anything—weird happens, call me.”</p><p>“Okay, Agent DeYoung.”</p><p>“No matter how crazy it seems. Call.”</p><p>“I will,” she said. “Thank you. Thank you both.”</p><p>With a brief smile, she walked to the police cruiser and knocked on the passenger side window. When her father looked up at her, she opened the door. Then she hesitated and glanced back at them with a slight wave goodbye before climbing into the car. Inside, she gave her father a mild shove to disarm his stubborn frown.</p><p>Watching father and daughter, Dean cast a sidelong glance at Sam and said, “You thinking what I’m thinking.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam said. “She’s next.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A few blocks east, the Winchesters approached the house with the killer tree.</p><p>“Have I told you it’s good to have you back,” Dean said, smiling. “The real you?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Sammy with the soul inside,” Dean said. “You were good with her back there.”</p><p>“Lucy?”</p><p>“May seem natural to you,” Dean said. “And I know you don’t remember how it was—how you were, before. But it’s night and day, man.”</p><p>Sam nodded thoughtfully. “You’re right. I don’t remember being different. Hell, I don’t remember being gone. Guess it’s like waking from a coma. Everyone else lived through that time and I was... on pause. This part of me, I mean. But, in some ways, feels like I recovered from a serious illness. Feels good to be back.”</p><p>From where Dean parked the Impala on the shoulder of Chaney Lane, it looked as if somebody had killed the tree. The large white oak had toppled onto its side right across the street, completely uprooted, and blocking through traffic. A municipal truck with a flashing yellow light idled nearby. The driver had tied a rope around the upper trunk, preparing to tow it out of the way. A few neighbors stood in front of their houses or in doorways, silently watching the workman.</p><p>“That tree killed a man? Friggin’ Day of the Triffids?”</p><p>“According to Jeffries,” Sam said. “A branch broke through a second-story window and impaled Max Barnes.”</p><p>“So they put it down?” Dean asked. “Like a rabid dog?”</p><p>“That’s all I know, dude.”</p><p>“Storm wasn’t that bad,” Dean said. “Lightning, maybe?”</p><p>“No sign of a lightning strike.”</p><p>“Maybe the truck driver knows.”</p><p>Before they reached the man, Dean noticed something odd. The tree had come out of the ground with its roots intact. Behind the cluster of roots, clods of dirt and stones trailed back to the side of the house at 109 Chaney Lane. The large hole in the ground where the roots had been reminded Dean of the ever-expanding sinkhole he’d fallen into earlier in the evening. But this hole, for now at least, remained stable. He glanced up the side of the house and saw the shattered secondstory window, the edges of the glass streaked with blood.</p><p>“That’s the boy’s room,” a middle-aged woman said to him from the neighboring yard, nibbling nervously on her thumbnail. “But it wasn’t him.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Dean said.</p><p>“Are you with the police?”</p><p>“FBI,” Dean said. “And you are?”</p><p>“Barb,” she said. “Barb Henn.”</p><p>“You know what happened here?”</p><p>“Max Barnes, the father, was killed. Some kind of freak accident.”</p><p>“Freak accident?”</p><p>“Apparently he was killed by a tree branch going through the son’s window. That’s what I meant about it being the boy’s room but the boy wasn’t the one hurt.”</p><p>“What happened leading up to the... accident?”</p><p>“When the storm started, I was watching TV with my daughter Nicole.” She pointed back toward her house and Dean saw a teenaged girl standing in the doorway, arms folded, leaning against the doorjamb, which had a black ribbon pinned above the doorbell. When Dean’s gaze fell on the girl, she gave him a little wave. Dean smiled with a slight nod of acknowledgment before turning his attention back to the mother.</p><p>“Go on.”</p><p>“The wind was gusting, but I didn’t think about it too much,” she said. “Other than worrying we might lose power, which we did, briefly. A brownout.”</p><p>“And the tree?”</p><p>“I heard it thrashing about, hitting the siding, but...” She shrugged. “Nothing unusual, considering the wind. Then I heard glass shatter.”</p><p>“Did you go outside? Look out your window?”</p><p>“Not until I heard Melinda—poor Mrs. Barnes— screaming. I thought something had happened to her boy, Daniel. That’s when I looked out the side window. I knew something was off. Then it hit me. Their white oak tree was missing. I could see the entire side of their house.” She shook her head in disbelief. “Of course, I went outside then and that’s when I saw the tree. In the street.”</p><p>“Like it is now?”</p><p>“No,” she said. “It was standing! Upright. Well, at least for a moment. But then it slowly tipped over and crashed to the ground. How is that possible? Sure, a tornado could uproot a tree, but this wasn’t a tornado. Other than the window, nothing was damaged—I mean, aside from Max.”</p><p>“Freak storm cell, maybe.”</p><p>“Something freaky,” she said. “Such a shame. I can certainly sympathize with the family. I lost my husband in the factory fire.”</p><p>“Sorry for your loss.”</p><p>“Thank you,” she said. “Nicole and I lean on each other a lot since then.”</p><p>“Earlier tonight, did you happen to see the vic—Max Barnes?”</p><p>The woman shook her head. “Paramedics brought him down on a stretcher but his body was completely covered. That’s when I knew he was... that poor man.”</p><p>“The mother and son? Where are they now?”</p><p>“They left in one of the police cars,” Tom Cuffee, the municipal worker, said to Sam over his shoulder as he walked toward the open door of his truck.</p><p>“To give a statement?”</p><p>“No,” the workman said. “She did that here. She wanted the boy checked out. Mother was kind of hysterical, but the kid was worse, in a way. Robotic.”</p><p>“Shock.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Cuffee said, shaking his head in sympathy. “Jeez, young kid like that, sees his dad killed right in his own home. Can you imagine?”</p><p>“Did you see the father’s injury?”</p><p>“Not personally,” Cuffee said, sitting in the driver’s seat with the door ajar. “But I heard the branch went clear through his chest, back to front.”</p><p>“During the storm?”</p><p>“That’s what I hear.”</p><p>“Is that branch still on the tree?”</p><p>“Police had it sawed off,” Cuffee said. “Evidence. Of what, I don’t know.”</p><p>“Anything like this ever happened here in town before?”</p><p>“Are you serious? I doubt anything like this ever happened anywhere.”</p><p>“Good point,” Sam said. “About the tree...”</p><p>“Just moving it to the side of the road. Crew will come by in the morning with chainsaws and take care of the disposal.”</p><p>“Any idea how it got in the middle of the street in the first place?”</p><p>Cuffee closed his door, but lowered the window to continue the conversation.</p><p>“As if it couldn’t get any weirder, right? One of the cops said... No, I shouldn’t repeat that stuff. It’s in poor taste.”</p><p>Sam raised an eyebrow. “Trust me, I won’t be offended.”</p><p>The man started the truck, put it in gear and slowly began to drag the tree toward the shoulder of Chaney Lane. Branches bent, twisted and a few cracked as the trunk neared its temporary destination. Sam walked beside the truck, casting nervous glances back at the fallen tree with its thrashing limbs. Such was the life he and Dean had led that he had no trouble accepting the possibility of a murderous tree.</p><p>With the tree parallel to the curb, occupying the shoulder of the suburban street, Cuffee shifted the truck into park and climbed out to untie the rope.</p><p>“Okay,” he said to Sam. “I suppose you being FBI, you understand gallows humor in these types of lousy situations.”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“One of the cops looks from the side of the house where the tree used to be to the middle of the street where it ended up and says, ‘this tree committed murder then tried to flee the scene of the crime.’ “ Cuffee punctuated the delivery of the line with an embarrassed frown. “What I tell you? Poor taste.”</p><p>Sam shook his head. “As good an explanation as any.”</p><p>Dean joined them as the workman took out a utility knife and sliced the rope above the knot around the tree trunk. Then the man walked back to the truck’s tow ball hitch and sliced the rope free at that end, coiled it and tossed it in the truck bed.</p><p>“What do the cops think really happened?” Dean asked.</p><p>“They talked about writing it up as a wind-related accident,” Cuffee said. “But honestly? I think we all know that’s bull crap.”</p><p>The man climbed back into the driver’s seat of the truck, closed the door and turned off the yellow warning lights that had been flashing since the Winchesters arrived on the scene.</p><p>“What’s your explanation?” Dean asked.</p><p>Cuffee leaned out the window with a conspiratorial look on his face.</p><p>“Three words,” he said and ticked them off on his fingers. “U-F-O.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t put it past them ETs to have a secret base up there in the Rockies. Their own version of Cheyenne Mountain.”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean. “Why would... aliens want a tree?”</p><p>“Who knows? Thumbing their noses at us.”</p><p>“Fight the fairies,” Dean said—just loud enough for Cuffee to hear.</p><p>“I wouldn’t hazard a guess as to their sexual persuasion,” he said, shrugging. “But if you got a better explanation, I’d love to hear it.”</p><p>“Not at the moment, no,” Sam said.</p><p>“You said FBI, right?” Cuffee said, arching an eyebrow.</p><p>“You wouldn’t happen to be MIB? No, wait. If you tell me, you’ll have to wipe my memory. Forget I asked.”</p><p>As the man drove away, Dean cast an accusatory glance at Sam.</p><p>“What?” Sam said. “He seemed rational up until the end.”</p><p>“Nice boy. Always kept to himself.”</p><p>“Shut up, Dean.”</p><p>As they walked back toward the Impala, Sam asked, “Neighbor lady see anything?”</p><p>“Saw the tree topple in the middle of the street,” Dean said. “Not how it got there. Mother and son taken to the hospital to have the kid checked out.”</p><p>“Got that from the workman too,” Sam said. “Kid had to have seen something.”</p><p>“We’ll catch him in the morning,” Dean said. “Hey, you remember all those black ribbons and bows on Arcadia Boulevard?”</p><p>“Yeah. Hard to miss.”</p><p>They climbed into the Impala. Dean hesitated before turning the ignition.</p><p>“Neighbor had one on her door. Lost her husband in the fire.”</p><p>“You’re thinking we should check out the garment factory?”</p><p>“Worth a look.”</p><p>Dean started the Impala. Before he pulled away from the curb, Sam’s cell phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID and said, “Clayton Falls PD again.”</p><p>Sam answered.</p><p>“Agent Shaw,” Officer Richard Jeffries said. “Keeping you and your partner in the loop, like you asked.”</p><p>“Go ahead.”</p><p>“Report on the radio of an escaped supermax inmate.”</p><p>“A jailbreak?” Sam asked, incredulous. Though, at this point, nothing should have surprised him.</p><p>“Yep. Most recent addition to the zoo. Serial killer named Ragnar Bartch, better known as Butcher Bartch or the Cleaver Cannibal.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’m familiar with Bartch,” Sam said to Jeffries, because he thought an FBI agent should be aware of “most wanted” criminals even after they were no longer at large. “Anyone heard from the warden? Alden Webb?”</p><p>“Chief ‘s trying to reach him as we speak.”</p><p>“Where was Bartch spotted?”</p><p>“303 Perry Lane,” Jeffries said. “Off of Welker, near the cluster of hotels and motels. Phoned in by... Jylene Livengood.”</p><p>“Got it. Thanks,” Sam said, ending the call. He gave Dean the details on Bartch and the address of the eyewitness. “Perry Lane’s near our motel.”</p><p>Dean drove north toward Welker Street.</p><p>“Wondering if this is the real con or another manifestation.”</p><p>“Either way, he’s dangerous.”</p><p>“That’s what puzzles me about the trees.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This whole perception as reality theory of yours,” Dean said. “People don’t perceive trees as mobile, let alone murderous?”</p><p>“Not usually. No.”</p><p>“That tree looked like it pulled itself out of the ground and took a stroll.”</p><p>Dean caught the light at Welker and headed west. With four lanes of traffic instead of two, he pressed down on the accelerator and zipped through town.</p><p>“Before it collapsed.”</p><p>“And it’s still there,” Dean said. “It’s a real tree.”</p><p>Sam nodded grimly. “Even the things that aren’t real,” he said. “There seem to be more of them, and they’re lasting longer. Dude, whatever’s causing this, it’s getting stronger.”</p><p>“And we’re no closer to figuring out what it is.”</p><p>With that sobering thought on their minds, they drove in silence until they reached Perry Lane. Sam spotted one house on the block lit up like a Christmas tree. Every light in every room on both floors was on, along with the lights on either side of the front door. Made it easy to read the address.</p><p>“That’s it. Three-oh-three.”</p><p>A police cruiser, light bar flashing, waited at the curb.</p><p>As Sam and Dean walked toward the house, a tall African American cop with a touch of gray at his temples and sergeant’s stripes on his sleeves exited the house and walked toward his cruiser. Stopping when he spotted them, he hooked his fingers in his belt and said, “You’re the gentlemen from the FBI?”</p><p>“Yes, we are,” Dean said.</p><p>“Could I see some ID?”</p><p>“Sure,” Sam said. After a long night, their FBI suits were looking more than a bit disreputable. Either that or the man was overly cautious.</p><p>“Agents Shaw and DeYoung,” he said as they showed their laminates.</p><p>“Sergeant Cornelius Harrison,” the man said, extending his hand to Sam and Dean in turn. “Good to meet you. Ms. Livengood reported a prowler.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam, then back at the sergeant.</p><p>“We heard she reported Butcher Bartch on the loose.”</p><p>“She was mistaken about the ID,” Harrison said. “Deputy Warden called the station. As of five minutes ago, Bartch was still in his cell.”</p><p>“What about Webb?”</p><p>“No word from the warden,” Harrison said. “Chief ‘s sending a car to his home.” He jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the house with the red-lined electricity usage. “She may have seen a prowler, but it wasn’t Bartch. I had two more units here. Searched the grounds and the house. Nothing. I’m heading back to the station. You’re welcome to talk to her. I doubt she’ll be sleeping any time soon.”</p><p>Harrison climbed into his cruiser and pulled away as Sam rapped on the door of the house. A moment later, the door opened a crack, revealing a security chain in place. A pale young woman with long black hair and wide gray eyes stared at them.</p><p>“Jylene Livengood?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “And you are?”</p><p>“FBI,” Sam said.</p><p>“FBI. Really? That was fast.”</p><p>“Already in town,” Dean said.</p><p>“The police were here and gone,” she said. “They found nothing.”</p><p>“We have a few questions,” Sam said. “Won’t take long.”</p><p>“You got ID?”</p><p>The brothers took turns holding their FBI credentials up to the gap in the doorway. She nodded, closed the door to remove the chain, then opened it again and waved them in. Locking the deadbolt and chain after they were inside, she turned toward them and clasped her hands together.</p><p>Without preamble, she said, “I saw Ragnar Bartch. Standing right in front of my house. And he had a meat cleaver in his hands! But the police don’t believe me.”</p><p>Sam glanced around the living room. Neat with the exception of small stacks of various newspapers, local, regional and national, along with separate piles of weekly news magazines. In stark contrast to the abundance of news, facts and figures in her reading material, her walls were hung with an assortment of what looked like original paintings of fantasy creatures and settings, centaurs striding through forests, mermaids reposing on rock clusters at shorelines, dragons sleeping in gold-strewn caverns.</p><p>“How can you be sure it was Bartch?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I know his face,” she said, nodding quickly, as if it were a nervous tic. “I was among the protesters when they added the supermax wing. I keep track of who they bring into that place. I have their names, their court photos, and a list of their crimes. Well, at least the crimes for which they were convicted. Who knows what other heinous acts they committed? It’s enough to keep you up at night.”</p><p>“You are up late,” Dean observed.</p><p>“Storms woke me,” she said. “Couldn’t sleep. Came down to watch a movie on cable. Looked out the window and saw him standing there. Would you like some coffee? I’ve already had three. It’s no problem.”</p><p>“No thanks,” Sam said. “Actually, I could use a cup.”</p><p>She hurried into the kitchen and, after a minute of clinking ceramic and stainless steel, she returned with a tray holding three cups of coffee, a container filled with packets of sugar and other sweeteners, and a small-handled creamer.</p><p>Sam drank his coffee as quickly as its temperature permitted and continued his questioning. “Did you happen to see where this man went?”</p><p>“No. I ran to the phone. Called the police. When I looked out the window again, he was gone. I checked all the doors and windows and closets. I know he’s out there.”</p><p>“According to Sergeant Harrison, Bartch is in his cell.”</p><p>She rubbed her arms, as if for warmth, and nodded. “Yes, he told me. But I know what I saw.”</p><p>“You live alone?”</p><p>“No. Well, yes, right now,” she said. “My roommate’s a fantasy artist. She’s at a convention in Denver. Won’t be back until Monday.”</p><p>That explained the dichotomy between her reading material and the subject matter of the paintings.</p><p>“If you like,” Sam said, “Agent DeYoung and I could check the exterior of the house again.”</p><p>“That would be awesome,” she said. “Thank you!”</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>After Dean downed his coffee, the Winchesters stepped outside. Sam waited as she locked and chained the door behind them. Dean walked to the Impala and brought back a pair of flashlights.</p><p>“One more cup of coffee and she will literally climb the walls,” Dean said as he slapped a flashlight in Sam’s palm. “Think he might still be here?”</p><p>“She saw a manifestation,” Sam said. “It’s possible.”</p><p>They pulled out their handguns.</p><p>Sam took the left side of the house while Dean circled around to the right.</p><p>The flashlight beam pierced the darkness, startling a cat that meowed indignantly and bolted across the lawn, climbing the nearest fence and disappearing. Toward the back of the house, a back-door light cast a wan glow that failed to extend to a padlocked tool shed at the back of the property. Sam caught movement to his right and swung the flashlight in that direction. Another flashlight answered his, momentarily blinding him.</p><p>“Dean.”</p><p>“Sam.”</p><p>“So far, all clear.”</p><p>“Tool shed?”</p><p>“Padlocked.”</p><p>“In back?”</p><p>Sam walked along the left side of the galvanized steel tool shed as Dean approached on the right. The flashlight revealed a narrow gap behind the shed. Possibly wide enough to hide a man. And this was the darkest part of the backyard.</p><p>Sam stepped away from the side of the shed, approaching the back at a wider angle, when he heard a creak of metal from above. As his gaze darted upward, he held his handgun beside the barrel of the flashlight, aiming them together.</p><p>A hulking, man-shaped silhouette rose above the roof of the shed.</p><p>A footfall creaked against protesting metal. An instant later, the large man launched himself at Sam. His flashlight beam danced across a gleaming rectangle of metal held in the man’s right hand.</p><p>Alden Webb fought his way up out of a troubling dream and stared at the ceiling for a moment trying to remember the dream and why it had upset him, before the hard, repeated knocking on his front door registered on his consciousness.</p><p>The light from the television flickered across the ceiling of his bedroom, revealing an odd pattern of pulsing shadows that seemed to fade away as he became more alert. Shaking off the lethargy, he climbed out of bed and grabbed a robe from his closet.</p><p>“Just a minute,” he called out but doubted the visitor could hear him.</p><p>A few moments later, he swung open the door to reveal a police officer standing there, fist raised as if he intended to knock again—on Webb’s face if necessary.</p><p>“Is there a problem Officer—“ he read the man’s nametag—“Jarrett?”</p><p>“Chief Quinn sent me when you didn’t answer your phone.”</p><p>“I didn’t hear it ringing,” Webb said, surprised he had slept through a ringing phone long enough to prompt a personal visit from one of Quinn’s men. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“We had a report that a supermax con was loose in town,” Jarrett said. “Ragnar Bartch.”</p><p>“That’s impossible,” Webb said. “Besides, I would have been notified of any incident...” What if I missed that call as well? “I’ll call now.”</p><p>“That’s not necessary,” Jarrett said. “It was a false alarm. The deputy warden reports Bartch is in his cell. But when you didn’t answer your phone, Chief Quinn thought we should check on you.”</p><p>“Of course. Thank you. But I’m fine. I was sleeping. Deeply, I imagine, to have not heard the phone.”</p><p>“Have a good night, sir.”</p><p>After the police officer left, Webb closed and locked his door. “False alarm,” he said, shaking his head. “More like a crank call.”</p><p>After all this time, he thought he’d reached an accommodation with the townspeople. He knew they disliked having the prison nearby, but its record was immaculate and, over time, he had hoped for peaceful coexistence. But that was looking like a pipe dream.</p><p>Crank calls, he supposed, would be the order of the day now, another form of passive aggressive protest from all those with the “not in my backyard” attitude.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam fell backward, his finger tightening against the trigger of his gun as the gleaming stainless steel blade of the meat cleaver arced toward his neck. The gun went off and the round ripped into the galvanized metal wall of the tool shed—the manifestation of Butcher Bartch had vanished an instant before the bullet left the muzzle of the gun.</p><p>Dean came around the back of the shed, sweeping the area with his gun.</p><p>“Sam?” he called. “You all right?”</p><p>“Fine,” Sam said, rubbing his palm against the side of his neck. “Bartch jumped me and vanished.”</p><p>“You got a good look at him?”</p><p>“Just the cleaver,” Sam said as Dean helped him to his feet. “That was plenty.”</p><p>“You hit him?”</p><p>“No.” Sam grabbed his flashlight out of the grass. “Vanished in mid air before the bullet could hit him.”</p><p>“Should we tell the lady of the house?”</p><p>“Not unless she heard the shot. Doubt he’ll come back tonight.”</p><p>With dawn approaching, Dean started the Impala, thought about calling it a night and heading back to their motel, which was only a few blocks away, but a missed opportunity had been nagging at him all day. He turned to Sam and said, “You up for one quick run?”</p><p>“The garment factory?”</p><p>“You got the address?”</p><p>“Should be in my browser history,” Sam said. He reached back over his seat and grabbed the laptop case, removed the computer and booted it. “From what I read, there’s not much left.”</p><p>“You said they debated making the factory the site of the memorial?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Which means something’s there,” Dean said. “It’s the elephant in the room, so let’s not ignore it.”</p><p>Sam found the address and relayed the directions to Dean.</p><p>The Clayton Falls Apparel Company was located on the western edge of town, less than a half-mile from the site of the tarantula attack. But not much remained of the redbrick building. As Dean parked across the street from what had been the entrance to the factory, even with its exterior bathed in the cold glare of streetlights, he had the impression of darkness.</p><p>He climbed out of the Impala and stared at the factory, trying to get a sense of the place. Wrought-iron fencing outlined the perimeter of the grounds, but here and there sections had collapsed or were about to fall over. At one spot, it looked as if a bulldozer had rolled over the fencing to create a mound of debris, but the task had been abandoned. There was so much yellow police tape repeating the words DANGER and KEEP OUT zigzagging through the fencing that Dean wondered if the tape was all that held the rest of it upright.</p><p>Most of the exterior walls were intact, but crumbling away from the top down, stained black from the fire and smoke. The entire roof was missing, having collapsed into the interior. And a wall on the left side was little more than a mound of damaged bricks.</p><p>The building was dead. A bit of urban blight on the landscape. Like the physical representation of a psychic scar on the collective consciousness of Clayton Falls. Something they were unwilling to let go. But was it responsible for the strange phenomena in the town?</p><p>Slamming the trunk of the Impala, Sam joined Dean carrying an EMF meter.</p><p>“Ready?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>As they neared the building, Dean saw the freestanding wooden sign angled toward the path leading to where the front doors of the factory had been. The copper sheeting of the sign had tarnished over time, coated with a green patina, but Dean could make out the words engraved in the metal.</p><p><em>LAYTON FALLS APPAREL COMPANY</em></p><p><em>EST. 1898</em></p><p>“Look,” Sam said, pointing to the base of the sign.</p><p>Bouquets of flowers, still fresh, encircled the sign’s twin posts. Dean pointed at the open entranceway, which was home to several more bouquets and a few stuffed teddy bears. Not nearly as many visitors as the official memorial, but significant.</p><p>“An alternate memorial,” Dean said.</p><p>“This place is condemned, but they refuse to tear it down.”</p><p>“Got anything?”</p><p>Sam turned on the EMF meter, swept it back and forth as they walked under the doorway. “Nothing... yet.”</p><p>Dean looked up at the looming walls and the open sky overhead.</p><p>“Watch for falling bricks.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Forgot our hardhats.”</p><p>The streetlights failed to penetrate the gloom inside the building. Dean found he had to keep his head down. The footing was treacherous. Loose bricks, burnt and charred joists, and partially melted or shattered industrial sewing machines littered the floor. Broken tables and the hulks of ruined cutting machines impeded their progress. A charred and crumbling staircase that was probably once attached to one of the partial walls led up to nowhere before terminating. Dean’s flashlight beam startled a foraging rat, which promptly scurried away in the opposite direction. Throughout their examination of the interior, the EMF meter remained quiet.</p><p>After they completed a circuit of the factory, Dean said, “Okay. That was a whole lot of nothing.”</p><p>“Worth a shot,” Sam said as he switched off the meter.</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Before the fading of the night commenced, the deeper darkness continued to navigate through the town, coiling and uncoiling in puffs and wisps and streamers, in the familiar path, unaffected by the prevailing winds and the vagaries of the atmosphere. Its cycle repeated throughout the night, dipping to feed before moving on to sample another meal, and it had fed well. Its dark influence was spreading, like drops of ink in clear water.</p><p>Even humans not in direct feeding contact had begun to feel its ill effects. Anyone within the periphery of its awareness became a food source, a battery providing energy for its nocturnal presentations. And in feeding on their darkness, their fear and despair, it grew stronger, sensing more of itself and forming more of itself with each stop.</p><p>Soon it would be whole, and fear would become all they knew, death their only escape.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Once again Sam found himself underground.</p><p>Not in the root cellar. This time he was tied to a ladderback chair in an unfamiliar, dank basement. Three narrow windows high in the concrete wall to his right provided a view of ground level, judging by the blades of grass visible above the windowsills. The windows supplied the only source of illumination, but no more than the gloom of dusk. Maybe a half-hour from nightfall.</p><p>Yet the dim light was sufficient to reveal the man standing ten feet away from him, the top of his head close to exposed pipes between joists in the low ceiling. He stood with arms crossed over his chest, a satisfied smirk on his face. In one clenched fist he held a long butcher knife, its blade pointing up, beside his jaw.</p><p>Soulless Sam.</p><p>“You again,” Sam said with disgust.</p><p>“Long night?” Soulless Sam said. “Or have you been avoiding me.”</p><p>“Haven’t given you a second thought.”</p><p>“Oh, you should,” Soulless Sam said. “Because I’ve decided to do you a favor.”</p><p>“Favor?”</p><p>“Help you become a better hunter.”</p><p>“Really?” Sam said. “I thought your goal was to replace me.”</p><p>“Oh, that will happen soon,” Soulless Sam said. “But first, the favor. I’m taking Dean out of the equation.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Sam’s forehead had become damp.</p><p>Condensation began to bead on the concrete walls of the basement. Though Sam could see the darkening sky through the windows, he had the sensation they were descending underwater, in a chamber with faulty seals, as if somewhere nearby the increasing pressure would blow gaskets and water would flood the room. Sam would drown. But somehow Soulless Sam would have an escape route.</p><p>“You heard me,” Soulless Sam said. “Addition by subtraction.”</p><p>Along the walls, the clear moisture ran like tear tracks down the concrete. Slowly, the running water turned pink and then, trickle by trickle, a deeper red. At some point, Sam decided the walls were bleeding but could not understand why or how.</p><p>“You don’t need Dean,” Soulless Sam said. “You were a better hunter without him. Much more efficient and ruthless.”</p><p>“Yeah. That worked out well,” Sam said bitterly, the botched handling of the Arachne in the forefront of his mind.</p><p>“It’s a marathon, Sam,” Soulless Sam said, waving off the criticism. “On balance, a hunter needs ruthless efficiency. Dean gets in the way of that. Besides, I won’t want him around when I take your place. So my first order of business is to take him out.”</p><p>“You can’t hurt Dean.”</p><p>“You’d be surprised what I can do, Sammy.”</p><p>“I won’t let you.”</p><p>Fissures formed in the damp concrete walls. Blood welled up from the cracks and oozed down to the floor, pools of it joining together and spreading toward the center of the basement. Soon it would cover the entire floor. And begin to rise.</p><p>“I’ll have the power,” Soulless Sam said. “You’ll be an afterthought.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Sam pulled against the rope binding his wrists to the chair behind his back. His ankles were tied to the front legs of the chair. No give in the knots. He considered throwing himself to the floor in an attempt to shatter the chair. But he’d be vulnerable for a few seconds and his doppelganger had the butcher knife.</p><p>“Face it, Sammy. You’re keeping Dean away from Lisa and Ben. He’d run to them in a heartbeat if he thought you could handle yourself. But he’ll never go while you’re alive. We both know it. And that leaves me with one option.” Soulless Sam chuckled, tapping the edge of the blade against his palm. “Actually, you should thank me. Dean’s excess baggage. You’ll travel faster without him. And be a better hunter for it.”</p><p>“You’re over,” Sam said to him. “A figment of my imagination.”</p><p>“Imagination is powerful,” Soulless Sam said. “Especially these days, don’t you think? I feel... rejuvenated.”</p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“You’ll find out. Sooner than you think.”</p><p>Sam lunged toward his doppelganger, pitching forward in the chair. He braced for the impact, determined to break free of his bonds before Soulless Sam could strike with the knife. But the impact never happened.</p><p>The basement floor opened in front of him, an expanding darkness, like the sinkhole at Mack’s Qwik Mart, but instantaneous. Blood rushed over the receding edges of the hole, a macabre waterfall.</p><p>Standing clear, Soulless Sam laughed as the floor swallowed Sam whole.</p><p>Sam awoke with an involuntary jerk of the muscles in his arms and legs. In the dream, he’d been fighting against the ropes binding him to a chair. Once awake, the ropes were remnants of his imagination and his limbs flailed wildly at the sudden freedom.</p><p>The motel room was dark. They’d pulled the blinds so the morning sun wouldn’t wake them before they’d logged a few hours of sleep. After two long nights in a row without much rest, the Winchester brothers were running on caffeine vapors and little else.</p><p>Wanting some fresh air to clear his head, Sam stood and walked to the foot of his bed. He stopped when he noticed the silhouette of a man across the room, back turned toward him, standing next to the other twin bed. Sam almost called Dean’s name, but saw his brother was asleep on the far bed. Then Sam saw the glint of stainless steel extending from the stranger’s fist.</p><p>For a moment, he thought the Butcher Bartch manifestation had somehow followed them back to their motel room, but the body type was wrong—and so was the blade. Not a cleaver—a butcher knife.</p><p>That’s impossible, Sam thought. I’m still dreaming.</p><p>Dreams within dreams. A waking dream?</p><p>The stranger raised the butcher knife over his head, clutching the dark handle in a double-handed grip, knuckles flexing, prepared to strike.</p><p>Sam charged across the room.</p><p>He almost expected his legs to betray him, or the floor to open up beneath him again, or the carpeting to bunch and trip him. But none of that happened. And he was almost fast enough to stop the attack.</p><p>As the stranger drove the point of the butcher knife downward, Sam slammed into him and the other man’s weight was as solid as his own, the impact jarring as they both fell to the floor. Before Sam saw the man’s face, saw that it was in fact his own face staring back at him, he registered the man’s empty hands.</p><p>The knife was missing.</p><p>Soulless Sam smiled at Sam.</p><p>“Too late!” he said.</p><p>Then vanished.</p><p>Dean Winchester, alone in the Impala, drove through a rainstorm at night with the radio turned to a classic rock station, but he heard more static than music. Over the hiss of the tires on the wet road, he heard snippets of Seger and AC/DC and Skynyrd. And no matter the song, the repetitive thwum-thwump of the windshield wipers kept time with the beat about as competently as an inebriated percussionist. Rising above this confused mush of sound with stark clarity, his cell phone rang. He glanced at the caller ID display: Lisa Braeden.</p><p>Shaking his head, he answered the call and said, “Ben, we’re not doing this again.”</p><p>“Dean!”</p><p>Lisa’s voice. Hushed and frightened.</p><p>Dean tightened his grip on the steering wheel, instantly alert.</p><p>“Lisa? What’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s in the house.”</p><p>“What’s in the house?” he said urgently. “Lisa, what’s in the house?”</p><p>“He looks human,” she whispered. “But he’s not.”</p><p>“Who—what is it?”</p><p>“Dean, he’s calling for you. Says he wants you but he’ll enjoy the fresh meat while he waits. He knows we’re here!”</p><p>Casting aside a dozen possibilities, Dean’s mind seized on one: ghoul.</p><p>“Where are you?”</p><p>“In the closet, in my bedroom. With Ben.”</p><p>“Dean, you gotta hurry!” Ben’s voice, smaller and somehow more distant.</p><p>“We’re frightened, Dean,” Lisa said and her voice sounded raw.</p><p>“Hang on, Lisa. I’m coming.”</p><p>Dean floored the accelerator, staring through the muddled windshield, wipers turned to their highest setting. Visibility sucked. He could see less than fifty feet in front of the Impala’s headlights before darkness swallowed his surroundings. He had yet to see one sign on the empty road, which seemed endless and unchanging no matter how long he drove. No destination ahead of him. Nothing in the rearview mirror.</p><p>“Dean, where are you?”</p><p>“I—I don’t know.”</p><p>“How long before you get here?”</p><p>“Soon—soon as I can.”</p><p>Dean looked left and right, desperate for a street sign or a route number. Anything. Was he even driving in the correct direction? Maybe he was heading away from them.</p><p>“Dean... he’s coming up the stairs,” Lisa whispered frantically. “I can hear him. Tapping a knife on the banister.”</p><p>Facing the inevitable, Dean asked, “Do you have any weapons? Anything you can use as a weapon?”</p><p>“I didn’t have time,” Lisa said. “I grabbed Ben and hid. Let’s see...” Dean heard sounds of rustling movement. “I have... hangers...”</p><p>“Wire?”</p><p>“Plastic.”</p><p>“Anything else?”</p><p>“Boots, shoes... Dean I didn’t know I’d need weapons in my closet!”</p><p>“Call 911.”</p><p>“I tried. They put me on hold. Dean, he’s going to kill us...”</p><p>“No,” Dean said defiantly. “That won’t happen. I won’t let it happen.”</p><p>Her voice dropped to a whisper. “It’s too late. He’s in my room...”</p><p>Silence on the line.</p><p>“Lisa? Lisa, talk to me?”</p><p>A moment later, he heard her scream.</p><p>“No!” Dean yelled.</p><p>He pounded the dashboard with his fist and—</p><p>—he was standing in her house, at the bottom of the staircase.</p><p>As Dean grabbed the railing and took the first step, a darkhaired ghoul appeared at the top of the stairs whistling an unrecognizable tune. It held a blood-streaked butcher knife in one hand. The index finger of the other hand pressed casually against the tip, as if testing its sharpness. In addition to the blood on the knife, the ghoul had blood smeared around its mouth.</p><p>“About time you showed up, Winchester,” the ghoul said. “Had to amuse myself while I waited. And I was feeling a bit peckish.”</p><p>“You son of a bitch!”</p><p>Dean launched himself up the stairs.</p><p>The ghoul waited for him impassively. Until the last second. Then it slashed the butcher knife toward Dean’s throat.</p><p>But Dean was expecting the attack, and threw his forearm into the crook of the ghoul’s elbow as he drove it back and slammed it into the wall. Dean drove his right fist into the ghoul’s abdomen, doubling it over. Then he placed his palm under the ghoul’s jaw and shoved its head back so hard the back of its skull smashed through the drywall.</p><p>Stunned by the head blow, the ghoul failed to resist when Dean grabbed its knife-wielding hand, twisted the wrist down and forced the blade deep into its gut. The ghoul gasped and sputtered, blood foaming on its lips. Dean grabbed the back of the ghoul’s neck with his right hand and its belt with the left, and ran it forward, hurling the creature down the staircase, head over heels.</p><p>Grunting in pain as the embedded knife cut through assorted internal organs, the ghoul rolled end over end, feet bursting through the railing at one point before its body veered toward the wall and crashed to the landing below. Moaning, the ghoul stirred, plucking feebly at the handle of the butcher knife.</p><p>Dean marched down the steps, pulling his gun from the holster and taking aim as he neared the last step. When Dean finally stood over the prone form, the ghoul opened its eyes and tried to focus on Dean’s face, but it couldn’t ignore the muzzle of the handgun.</p><p>“As last meals go...” it began.</p><p>Dean fired two quick shots into the creature’s head.</p><p>Standing in a dark silence broken only by his ragged breathing, Dean steeled himself for what he would find upstairs. He holstered his gun and rubbed his palm over his face. Numbness spread from his head to his toes. He clenched and unclenched his hands, sensing that he stood on a precipice. Looking down, he would see the face of madness.</p><p>Several moments passed before he realized he heard sobbing from upstairs.</p><p>Lisa!</p><p>Dean turned back to the staircase, moved toward it, fighting the sensation that the stairs would disappear before he could ascend them. He gripped the railing for support and it wobbled crazily beneath his grip, weakened by the balusters damaged in the ghoul’s fall. With each step up, he had increased difficulty breathing. When—if—he made it to the top, he was certain there would be no oxygen left in the house.</p><p>One plodding step after the other he came closer to the source of the sobbing. As much as he tried to hurry, he dreaded what he would find. The staircase seemed to rear upward, making the climb steeper. He pressed onward, determined to face the consequences of his actions, the price of his inaction... the result of his absence.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, the sobbing became louder, more sporadic and—how was it possible?—even more inconsolable.</p><p>The mournful sound led him to Ben’s room.</p><p>Dean stood in the open doorway. His body trembled with his inability to step forward, into the room. Lisa sat with her back toward him, hunched over—</p><p>—blood on the walls—</p><p>—blood stained the bedcovers and—</p><p>—blood on the floor, near...</p><p>Dean pressed his eyes shut before he could see—</p><p>—if he opened his eyes he would see—</p><p>He turned away and—</p><p>He woke up.</p><p>In the dark motel room, lying on his right side, shuddering as he held back a bottled grief that carried over from his disturbing dream. He’d collapsed on the bed without changing out of his rumpled clothing, falling asleep the moment his head hit the pillow. Now he felt as if he’d been through a spin cycle.</p><p>“Whoa,” he said softly as he swung his feet over the side of the bed.</p><p>“Dean!” Sam said from behind him, undisguised relief in his voice. “You rolled over.”</p><p>Dean looked over his shoulder. “What?”</p><p>“You moved—rolled away. Bad dream?”</p><p>“Doozy,” Dean said. “What’s wrong? Couldn’t sleep?”</p><p>“Same here. Bad dream.”</p><p>As Dean turned around, he saw Sam pass his hand over the edge of the bed, as if searching for something.</p><p>“You need loose change for the vending machine, just ask,” Dean said, looking at his brother, puzzled.</p><p>“No—it’s not that. Thought I saw a tear in the blanket. Guess I imagined it.”</p><p>Dean stood up and turned to face Sam across the bed.</p><p>“This ain’t no four-star hotel,” he said. “But I think I would have noticed ripped bedding.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>Sam stood there for a moment, looking dazed. Then he ran his fingers through his hair and exhaled forcefully.</p><p>“It’s late morning,” he said. “What do you say? Coffee with an energy drink chaser?”</p><p>“Sam? Something you want to talk about?”</p><p>“No. I’m good.”</p><p>“You don’t look good.”</p><p>Sam sighed. Dean had the impression his brother wanted to tell him what was bothering him so he kept quiet, waiting, to let Sam work it out.</p><p>“Like I said, bad dream. More like a waking dream. I was... talking to Soulless Sam. Guess it’s the unknown. He was me. But he’s a stranger, in a way.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Don’t know, man,” Sam said. “Maybe it’s a psychological side effect of having this wall in my head. Wondering what it—he was like. But what can I do? Doubt I’ll find any case studies on the Internet.”</p><p>“You think it’s cracking? The wall, I mean,” Dean said. “Maybe Cass can patch it.”</p><p>“No, it’s not that. I’m not remembering anything about my... lost time. Or what went on in the pit with Lucifer and Michael. It’s just about him... the not knowing.”</p><p>“Make sense, I suppose” Dean said. As if any of this makes sense.</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>By the time Dean parked the Impala across from 109 Chaney Lane, a tree service company was reducing the downed white oak to disposable pieces. One man cut off smaller branches and fed them into the wood chipper while a second man turned the trunk into manageable slices with a heavy-duty chainsaw.</p><p>Between the raucous roar of the chipper and the repetitive whine of the chainsaw, Dean felt a massive headache brewing. Lack of sleep and too much caffeine could be a crappy combination. At least he wasn’t hung-over. Although, at the moment, he couldn’t imagine how a hangover could possibly feel any worse.</p><p>Sam pressed the doorbell.</p><p>They waited with their FBI laminates at the ready. Melinda Barnes might assume they were with the press, intruding on a family tragedy, and slam the door in their faces. She would be more inclined to speak to someone trying to figure out what happened. But what they really needed was to speak to her son.</p><p>Nobody answered.</p><p>“Maybe the doorbell’s broken,” Dean said.</p><p>They certainly couldn’t hear much over the tree destruction in progress twenty feet behind them. Sam rapped on the door.</p><p>A few seconds later, a young woman with puffy eyes greeted them, taking a moment to check their IDs.</p><p>“What do you want?” she asked loudly, frowning as the wood chipper shrieked in the background.</p><p>Dean wondered if the constant reminder of the tree that had killed her husband bothered her, or if she found some solace in witnessing its methodical dismemberment. Either way, Dean decided he’d defer her question to Sam.</p><p>“Just a few questions, Mrs. Barnes.”</p><p>“I can’t hear,” she said, shaking her head. “Come inside.”</p><p>She led them through the house to the kitchen, which was decorated in a country style with pink gingham wallpaper, white cabinets with glass-front doors, and a light-colored hardwood floor. The windows overlooked a backyard with an all-purpose wooden playset in the center that featured a mini fort and climbing wall, a sliding board and swings. The kid wasn’t out there.</p><p>Melinda Barnes sat down at the kitchen table and motioned them toward chairs. Dean and Sam sat facing her.</p><p>“You’re with the FBI?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said. “We’re sorry for the loss of your husband. We have a few questions and then we’ll get out of your way.”</p><p>“I talked to the police last night,” she said, pressing one hand to her quivering chin. “Don’t know what else I can say.”</p><p>“We’re conducting a parallel investigation,” Dean said.</p><p>“This was a freak accident,” she said. “A horrible freak accident. That’s all, right?”</p><p>“Ma’am, you may be aware of some of the other... strange incidents around town in the last few days.”</p><p>“A boy killed in a hit and run.”</p><p>“Two now,” Dean said.</p><p>“Two?” she shook her head. “I hadn’t heard. Just some crazy talk down at the hair salon about a giant alligator.”</p><p>“Gila monster,” Dean said. “And a giant tarantula.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Red-kneed.”</p><p>“The point is,” Sam said. “We believe there may be a connection between all these incidents.”</p><p>“How could there be a connection to what happened to Max?” she asked. “It was a storm and the—the tree branch came through the window. Max was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”</p><p>“Was he?”</p><p>“Yes. We talked about trimming the tree because the branches scraped against the house. They scared Daniel, my son. Max said he would cut them in—in the morning.”</p><p>She clamped a hand over her mouth and squeezed her eyes shut. Tears rolled down her cheeks and she quickly wiped the tracks away.</p><p>“I’m sorry...” she choked.</p><p>“No need to apologize, ma’am,” Sam said.</p><p>“He was standing by the window because of the branches being so close... checking them, and the wind gust...”</p><p>“Is that what your son saw?”</p><p>“What? Of course, that’s what he saw. That’s what happened.”</p><p>“Did he tell you what he saw?” Sam pressed softly.</p><p>“He’s not—he’s not talking about it. I told him he didn’t have to talk about it,” she said. “But I saw. I heard him calling me and I ran into the room seconds after it happened. There was—the window was broken and... and Max was on the floor and there was so much blood.” She took a deep, shuddering breath. “I’m taking Daniel away from here for a while. I called my sister in Colorado Springs and we’re going...”</p><p>“I understand how upsetting this is, Mrs. Barnes,” Sam said. “It’s important that we talk to Daniel—“</p><p>She shook her head violently. “No!”</p><p>“He’s the only witness.”</p><p>“No!” she said again. She looked down at the kitchen table, nibbling on the fingernail of her index finger, slowly shaking her head. “No. I don’t want him to go through that again. To relive what happened to his father. Can you imagine how horrible that must have been? For a ten-year-old boy to see that... to see his father...”</p><p>Sam waited while she composed herself. Then he tried again.</p><p>“Ma’am, whatever caused this, whatever killed your husband, we don’t believe it was a freak accident. And we believe these incidents will continue to happen until we figure out what’s causing them and stop it.” Sam paused for a moment, then continued, his voice gentle but firm. “As a wife and as a mother, you wouldn’t want something like this to happen to another family, to another little girl or boy.”</p><p>She continued to shake her head.</p><p>“No, of course not,” she said.</p><p>Finally, she looked up at Sam, met his gaze, and her eyes were wet with more unshed tears.</p><p>“But, as a mother, I can’t put my son through this.”</p><p>“It’s okay, Mom,” a small voice said from the kitchen doorway.</p><p>“Daniel?” she said, wiping her cheeks hastily again. She rushed from the table and placed her hands on his shoulders. “You’re supposed to be sleeping in the guest room. What are you doing down here?”</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep with all the noise outside,” he said. “And I heard you talking to these men.”</p><p>“They were just leaving,” she said and glanced over her shoulder. “Weren’t you?”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean, who nodded, and they stood.</p><p>“You said you can stop this from happening again,” Daniel Barnes said, looking around his mother’s protective stance at the Winchesters. “Is that true?”</p><p>Standing there, the kid reminded Dean of Ben.</p><p>“Yes,” Dean said. “That’s true.”</p><p>“Then I want to help.”</p><p>“Daniel, you don’t need to—“ his mother began.</p><p>“I want to,” Daniel insisted. “For Dad.”</p><p>Melinda Barnes sobbed and clamped her hand over her mouth again.</p><p>“Dad would want me to be brave.”</p><p>“Yes,” she said. “Yes, he would.”</p><p>“Then I’ll do it.”</p><p>The boy took his mother’s place at the kitchen table and the Winchesters sat again. Melinda Barnes poured glasses of water for all of them. Dean sensed that she wanted to keep her hands busy or she would simply wrap Daniel in her arms and not let go until they left.</p><p>With a quick look at Sam, who nodded his understanding, Dean took over the questioning. “Tell us what happened, Daniel,” he said.</p><p>The boy nodded. Took a sip of his water and held the glass tightly in both hands.</p><p>“The tree branches scared me,” he said. “They looked like arms with long pointy fingers. I could see creepy shadows on the walls and ceiling of my room. The branches kept tapping the window when I was trying to sleep. I was afraid they wanted to grab me. But I kept telling myself ‘wind and shadows’ and that it was nothing to be afraid of and I fell asleep.” He took another sip of water. “Then I had a nightmare about the tree.”</p><p>“A nightmare,” Dean said. “Must have been spooky.”</p><p>Daniel nodded. “The tree was evil in my nightmare. It wanted to kill me and its branches were like arms and fingers. They tried to grab me. Reaching through my window.”</p><p>“In your dream,” Sam said.</p><p>“Yes,” Daniel said. “And that was when the window cracked.”</p><p>“The dream window?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No. The real window,” Daniel said. “It cracked in real life. Woke me up.” He took a deep breath. “It was like my nightmare had become real.”</p><p>Sam exchanged a meaningful look with Dean, but didn’t interrupt the flow of the boy’s account. “Go on.”</p><p>“I freaked out,” Daniel said. “I called out for Mom, but Dad came instead. He was kind of mad, but I told him about the window. And that’s when we found out the lights wouldn’t work.”</p><p>“You lost power?” Sam asked Melinda Barnes.</p><p>“Briefly,” she said.</p><p>“He—my dad—was standing by the window,” Daniel said. “He asked me to try my lamp, but that wouldn’t work either. And that’s when it happened. The wind was blowing hard and the branch came all the way through the window...”</p><p>“Daniel?” Melinda Barnes came around the kitchen island toward her son.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Daniel said and took another sip of water. “The branch went through Dad. All the way from his back out through here.” Daniel tapped his chest. “It was like—like it wanted to stab him. Like a sword fight with knights.”</p><p>Sam nodded grimly.</p><p>The poor kid’s only ten freakin’ years old, Dean thought.</p><p>“But then the tree acted like it did in my nightmare...”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Dean said, leaning forward.</p><p>“It moved. The whole tree—“ Daniel spread his arms to the sides and raised them together—“lifted itself up. And, it lifted Dad up, off the floor.”</p><p>“Oh, my God!” Melinda whispered harshly. “Daniel...”</p><p>“Dad was still alive...” Daniel continued.</p><p>Now the boy’s voice became strained with emotion. Dean could tell the kid was holding back tears, bravely trying not to cry, for his old man.</p><p>“And the tree... the tree made him... dance in front of me.”</p><p>“Jesus,” Dean whispered.</p><p>Melinda Barnes finally ran forward, dropping to her knees and wrapping her son in her arms, pressing her face against his chest and neck.</p><p>“Oh, God... oh, God...” she murmured.</p><p>“The branch swung him back and forth,” Daniel continued even though tears ran freely down his cheeks now. “Like he was a puppet.”</p><p>“Oh, honey, stop,” Melinda whispered. “Please stop! Oh, God...”</p><p>“I think it wanted to scare me before it left,” Daniel said, holding his palm against the back of his mother’s head in an effort to comfort her. “And then the tree... scraped him off the branch... and Dad’s blood smeared on the window... and he fell to the floor and I knew he was...” Sniffling, he wiped his nose on his sleeve. “It was just like my nightmare,” he said. “The tree was evil.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Without speaking, Sam and Dean walked past the tree service workmen, who had made a fair amount of progress in destroying the murderous tree. Sam almost regretted their having to prod the information out of Daniel Barnes, if only for the mom’s sake. Talking about the incident had seemed almost cathartic for the kid. He’d been keeping that horrible incident bottled up inside. His mom, already devastated by the accident, now had to accept a whole new and horrifying reality about her husband’s death. Sam wondered if Melinda Barnes could accept that a tree had willfully killed her husband. Or if she would rather convince herself that Daniel was wrong, that his version of events was informed by an already over-stimulated imagination.</p><p>Sam settled into the passenger seat of the Impala and stared numbly through the windshield.</p><p>Dean dropped into the driver’s seat and hesitated before inserting the key into the ignition.</p><p>“Poor kid,” he said. “Probably have nightmares for the rest of his life.”</p><p>“Nightmares,” Sam said. “Kid’s mom never suspected.”</p><p>“How could she?” Dean said. “Usually, you wake up and escape the nightmare. Kid wakes up and the nightmare comes out with him.”</p><p>Sam turned to Dean. What if there was more to his waking nightmare of Soulless Sam than he’d been willing to admit to himself, something beyond psychological fallout from the wall in his brain? “Maybe that’s what’s happening all over town. Nightmares coming to life. Lucy said she has nightmares about the accident that killed her boyfriend. And now his car is back.”</p><p>“People are sleepwalking and having nightmares. Guy jogging was dreaming of a giant tarantula? That what you’re saying?”</p><p>“What if it doesn’t have to be one-to-one,” Sam said.</p><p>“What if the nightmares of the sleeping are coming to life and attacking those who are awake?”</p><p>“So Joe Townie, safe in his bed, has a nightmare about a giant tarantula which then pops into existence near Harvey Dufford’s jogging route and slurps him up?”</p><p>“Essentially.”</p><p>“Whose nightmares?” Dean asked. “Everybody dreams.”</p><p>“Judging by last night,” Sam said. “Only the bad dreams.”</p><p>Sam recalled his own nightmare about Soulless Sam. Another nightmare from last night, however brief, that seemed to intrude on reality. But that wasn’t the first dream about his soulless doppelganger. He’d had a similar but normal—for him, at least—dream the night before. The second dream had been different. But after Dean woke up unscathed, Sam had convinced himself that he’d imagined the Soulless Sam manifestation. Sleep experts called it a false awakening. Dean hadn’t been injured by the butcher knife. The bedcovers hadn’t been sliced or punctured by the blade. Before they spoke to Daniel Barnes, Sam had no trouble attributing the brief apparition to a waking dream, probably caused by a combination of sleep deprivation and hours spent battling what they now knew were nightmare manifestations. Before that realization, he’d been unable to entertain the possibility that a dream could assume some sort of altered reality.</p><p>After hearing Daniel’s account of the tree attacking his father, Sam had to reevaluate what he himself had experienced. It seemed that whatever was happening to the residents of Clayton Falls could as easily affect him and Dean. The Winchesters weren’t immune.</p><p>“So we should all think happy thoughts?” Dean said. “Sam, we can’t control our subconscious.”</p><p>“Dude, you and I are time bombs,” Sam said. “Nuclear time bombs.”</p><p>“What are you saying?”</p><p>“If this can happen to anyone in town, including us, we could be the worst thing to happen to Clayton Falls.” Sam shook his head, appalled by the possibility of their subconscious minds out of control. “If memories of our experiences over the past years work their way into our dreams now, Clayton Falls could be primed for a bloodbath, maybe even an apocalypse.”</p><p>“If you’re right,” Dean said, “until we fix this, we don’t sleep.”</p><p>He started the Impala. The radio was playing Bowie’s “Changes.”</p><p>“This involves multiple dreamers,” Dean said. “How the hell do we pin it down?”</p><p>“Maybe we need to figure out why it started.”</p><p>They stopped at C.J.’s Diner for breakfast, as Dean said, no point trying to figure anything out on an empty stomach. Once again, the place was packed, but the morning turnover rate was impressive and they were seated in a small corner booth after only about ten minutes of waiting.</p><p>Dean ordered what he referred to as the ‘heart attack special’ which included fried eggs, bacon, and home fries, while Sam asked for cereal and a muffin. Before they even looked at a menu, they each ordered the bottomless cup of coffee. Their server, who introduced herself as Bobbi Jean Todd and told them how thrilled she was to meet two honestto- goodness FBI agents, brought their plates in record time.</p><p>Around them, many of the townspeople talked in hushed and urgent voices about weird things happening in the night. Sam heard some people say that they had seen zombies, who then disappeared into thin air. A few said they’d heard about giant bugs eating people. The other side of these conversations involved those who hadn’t witnessed anything bizarre and questioned the sobriety and, in some cases, sanity of those telling the strange tales.</p><p>Sam was pleasantly surprised that his laptop computer picked up a serviceable Wi-Fi signal from their corner booth. While he ate, he skimmed through news stories on Clayton Falls, using “sleep” and “dreams” and “nightmares” as keywords. He got a hit right away, brought up the story, and spun the computer around so Dean could read the screen.</p><p>“Place opened about six months ago,” Sam said. “The ‘Restful Sleep Center.’”</p><p>“They treat sleep disorders,” Dean said before finishing his third and final egg. “Think they might be creating a few? Mad scientist at work?”</p><p>Sam sipped his coffee and shrugged. “Can’t rule it out.”</p><p>A portly man with thinning hair entered the diner carrying a small notebook and, rather than asking to be seated, gravitated toward the more ebullient conversations about the previous night. Sam heard the man introduce himself as Darren Nash, a reporter for the Fremont Ledger, a county newspaper. He then proceeded to ask pointed questions and take voluminous notes. He kept shaking his head in incredulity, but the smile on his face was that of a man who’d just discovered he held a winning lottery ticket in his hand.</p><p>“Press,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean glanced at the man. “Bound to happen. But unless he’s writing for the Weekly World News, he’ll have trouble getting any of this crazy shit past an editor.”</p><p>“Don’t know, dude,” Sam said. “Lots of witnesses.”</p><p>“I’m not lining up for an interview,” Dean said. “Besides, I’m done.”</p><p>As he pushed his empty plate away, Bobbi Jean arrived at their table as if magically summoned.</p><p>“Anything else, agents?”</p><p>“Just the check,” Dean said. “Oh, and two large coffees to go.”</p><p>Sam directed Dean to the sleep center, a detached brick building that looked like a modest inn or slightly upscale motel, while lacking the quaint charm of a bed and breakfast. The sleep center stood adjacent to a row of shops in a commercial district less than a mile from their motel. The sign mounted on the front wall of the building featured a crescent moon above the words “Restful Sleep Center.” A second line of text read “Sleep Diagnostics of Clayton Falls.”</p><p>“So this is it?” Dean asked, sounding disappointed.</p><p>“You were expecting a creepy old mansion?”</p><p>“They could have a hunchback working reception.”</p><p>The receptionist was an attractive young woman with jet-black hair styled in a pixie cut, wearing a sleeveless houndstooth dress. She sat behind a semicircular mahogany desk with a raised front panel. Laura Bronick—according to the gold nameplate on her desk—smiled broadly.</p><p>“Welcome to Restful Sleep!” she said.</p><p>“I stand corrected,” Dean said.</p><p>Her smile faltered a bit. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Not important.” Dean removed his FBI credentials from his jacket pocket and showed them to her. “Agent DeYoung and Agent Shaw. Need to talk to whoever’s in charge.”</p><p>“Do you have an appointment?”</p><p>“We’re not here to sleep,” Dean said. Then he added, sotto voce, “Although a few hours’ sleep sounds mighty good about now.”</p><p>Sam leaned forward. “We’re conducting an investigation.”</p><p>“Oh, in that case...” She consulted a chart on a stand beside her computer keyboard. “We’re short-staffed this time of day. I’ll see if our administrative director is available.”</p><p>She donned a slim headset with a tiny projecting microphone and pressed an extension button on the top of her phone console.</p><p>“Ms. Bessette, there are two gentlemen here from the FBI. No. They didn’t say. Okay. Thank you.”</p><p>She disconnected the call and smiled at them again.</p><p>“She’ll be here in a few moments. Please have a seat while you wait.”</p><p>Sam glanced over his shoulder at the luxurious tan leather sofa and bookending chairs along the wall opposite the reception desk. If anything, they looked too damn comfortable. He didn’t know about Dean, but if he sat down for more than ten consecutive seconds, he’d probably fall asleep.</p><p>“Thanks. We’ll stand.”</p><p>Dean shot Sam a look that told him he’d had the same thought.</p><p>“Surprised you’re open on a Saturday,” Sam said to the receptionist.</p><p>“We have patients check in Friday night and check out Saturday,” she said. “We’re closed Sunday and Monday.”</p><p>“So this place helps people sleep?” Sam asked.</p><p>“At Restful Sleep Center we identify and treat sleep disorders,” Laura said by rote in her infallibly cheery voice. Then she shrugged and went a bit off-script. “Sleep is important. You know what they say, if you never slept, you’d go insane.”</p><p>“They say that, huh?” Sam said.</p><p>Soulless Sam had gone over a year without sleep. Sam wondered if his soulless self might be considered insane. And if so, could the insanity have been caused by lack of sleep. Or was the absence of a soul—and therefore a conscience—enough to make an otherwise normal man appear insane? Because if sleeplessness was a contributing factor, wouldn’t that affect Sam too? They shared a body. Could long-term sleep deprivation cause lasting effects, even after a soul restoration?</p><p>Laura chuckled. “Well, I’m no scientist. That’s just something I read somewhere. If you don’t sleep, you don’t dream. And if you don’t dream, you go cuckoo.”</p><p>“Good to know,” Sam responded.</p><p>A statuesque brunette wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a blood-red business suit, and impressive heels entered the lobby through the glass door behind the receptionist’s desk. Her dark hair, piled high in a loose chignon, was held in place with jeweled hairpins. Sam fought a smile as Dean almost stood at attention, stepping forward to introduce himself.</p><p>“I’m Agent DeYoung,” Dean said. “This is my partner, Agent Shaw.”</p><p>“Pleasure to meet you,” she said, offering her hand. “I’m Sophie Bessette, director of the Restful Sleep Center.”</p><p>Dean shook her hand and reluctantly—or so it seemed to Sam—stepped aside for Sam to follow suit.</p><p>“I must say, the last thing I expected when I woke up this morning was a visit from the FBI. How may I assist you?”</p><p>“It’s a—uh, matter of Homeland Security,” Dean said, his voice hushed. “We’re investigating a series of strange incidents in Clayton Falls. You are familiar with what’s been happening in town, Ms. Bessette?”</p><p>The woman glanced briefly at the receptionist, raised her eyebrows, and looked back at Dean and Sam.</p><p>“I’ve heard some... unusual rumors. But I didn’t give them much credence. Are you saying these things are actually happening?”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>“We haven’t had anything unusual happen here at Restful Sleep, if that’s what you’re checking. Have we, Laura?”</p><p>“Just the same old routine.”</p><p>“Of course, our patient records are confidential,” the director said. “Unless you have a warrant, I won’t be able to provide access to—“</p><p>“We’re not interested in patient records,” Sam said. “We were more interested in... Is there somewhere we could speak in private?”</p><p>“An office,” Dean said, bumbling a bit. “Your office. You do have an office, right?”</p><p>Sophie smiled indulgently at Dean.</p><p>“As a matter of fact, I do have an office. Follow me.”</p><p>“With pleasure,” Dean said, echoing her earlier sentiment and yet sounding decidedly lecherous for a professional environment.</p><p>As they followed the woman down the hall, Dean held out his arm to slow Sam and whispered, “Getting a definite hotfor- teacher vibe from this one.”</p><p>“Really? I hadn’t noticed.”</p><p>“No?”</p><p>“Aside from when you tripped over your tongue.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“Maybe she’s luring you into her trap.”</p><p>They picked up their pace and fell in step behind her by the time she motioned them through a doorway into her spacious office. After they were all seated with the door closed, she asked, “Private enough?”</p><p>“We don’t want to cause a panic,” Sam said. “You see, we’re investigating possible terrorist activity here in Clayton Falls.”</p><p>“Terrorism? Here?”</p><p>“Possibly,” Sam said, quickly adding, “But more as a potential testing ground for a large scale attack in a major metropolitan area.”</p><p>“Okay, granting that this information is a bit alarming, I still fail to see how Restful Sleep could be involved in your investigation.”</p><p>“We suspected a weaponized airborne hallucinogen,” Sam continued. “But now we believe these incidents are related to sleeping.”</p><p>“Ah, comes the dawn.”</p><p>“Specifically, nightmares,” Dean said. “And we recently discovered that you treat sleep disorders here.”</p><p>“Agent... DeYoung, was it? All sleep centers treat sleep disorders.”</p><p>“We thought maybe it was more than a coincidence that nightmares seem to trigger these incidents and there happens to be a sleep center in town.”</p><p>She folded her hands on a daily planner in the center of her desk, a prim pose that was no doubt fueling Dean’s schoolteacher fantasies.</p><p>“Sleep centers are not that uncommon,” she explained. “One in fifteen Americans suffers from sleep apnea. In a town the size of Clayton Falls we could have close to a thousand patients for that disorder alone.”</p><p>“You must be very busy here,” Dean said.</p><p>“Unfortunately, the condition often goes undiagnosed.”</p><p>“Do you treat people who have nightmares?”</p><p>“Not directly,” she said, adjusting her glasses on the bridge of her nose. “We don’t treat people simply because they might have nightmares. But those who have trouble sleeping may experience loss of breath and anxiety. Some of them stop breathing many times during a single night. Physiological symptoms of distress could potentially trigger bad dreams.”</p><p>“But you would have no reason to cause someone to have nightmares.”</p><p>“Certainly not,” she said indignantly. She took a deep breath to calm herself. “Maybe I could assist your investigation better if I understood what you believe is happening.”</p><p>“It’s complicated,” Sam said.</p><p>“Just a theory,” Dean added.</p><p>“We believe that somehow nightmares are... becoming real.”</p><p>“You’re joking.”</p><p>“We’re not sure how this is happening,” Sam said. “Initially we suspected a hallucinogen as the sole bioterrorism agent, but several people have been killed by these manifestations.”</p><p>“There was something odd about the hit and run,” she said. “A tragedy, certainly, but not a nightmare.”</p><p>“What’s ‘odd’ is that the car vanished after it killed each victim,” Dean said.</p><p>“There was more than one?”</p><p>“A second one last night. Same car. Multiple witnesses,” Sam said. “And we—Agent DeYoung and I—witnessed a few bizarre incidents personally last night.”</p><p>“And you believe these are somehow connected to nightmares.”</p><p>“A boy dreamed a tree outside his bedroom window wanted to kill him,” Sam said. “He woke up in a panic. His father came into the room and was killed by a tree branch coming through the window.”</p><p>“Again, a tragedy, but that could also be a horrible coincidence,” she said. “There was a violent storm last night.”</p><p>“The car involved in the hit and runs was destroyed a year ago,” Dean said. “Now it’s back. In mint condition.”</p><p>She patted her hair, tucked a few loose strands behind her ears and shook her head slightly.</p><p>“I’m not convinced—at least nowhere near as convinced as you two seem to be—but I can offer you a quick tour of our facility to... assure you that Restful Sleep has absolutely no involvement in these so-called terrorist activities, whatever their cause.”</p><p>Sam opened his mouth to decline, but Dean accepted her offer before Sam could get a word out. Resigned, Sam shut his mouth and followed behind as she led them to a few empty patient bedrooms that were orders of magnitude more luxurious than any of the motel rooms they had ever stayed in. Several times, Sam caught himself yawning, fighting the desire to curl up on one of the beds and catch a few winks while Dean and the director completed the tour without him.</p><p>“We diagnose and treat a number of common sleep disorders,” Sophie Bessette said as they walked through the facility, “including obstructive sleep apnea, insomnia, narcolepsy, sleepwalking, and snoring.”</p><p>“How?” Dean asked. “By watching them sleep?”</p><p>“Through polysomnograms, or sleep studies. Sleep technicians place sensors on the patient that record brain activity, breathing patterns, heart rate, and body movements. This feedback is monitored throughout the night. The results are then interpreted by our in-house physician and later sent to the patient’s referring physician for a consultation. Most sleep studies are concluded in one day—well, night.”</p><p>“What are the treatments?”</p><p>“The most common nonsurgical treatment is positive airway pressure therapy. The patient wears a mask that converts room air into pressurized air, which keeps the breathing passages open throughout the night. Sometimes weight loss can alleviate a condition. Or sleep position modification, using cushions or wedges to keep the patient from sleeping on his or her back.”</p><p>“So you wouldn’t, for instance, inject patients with experimental drugs?”</p><p>“Absolutely not!”</p><p>“Fascinating stuff, Ms. Bessette,” Dean said, turning on the charm. “Wouldn’t mind discussing it in detail over dinner.”</p><p>“Perhaps when the crisis is past.”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Dean said. “Excellent point.” He patted his pockets, found one of his FBI business cards and handed it to her. “In case you think of anything that might help our investigation. Anything at all. Day or night.”</p><p>Holding the card delicately at the edges between her thumbs and forefingers, she flashed Dean a provocative smile. “Certainly, Agent DeYoung.”</p><p>“Good,” Dean said, clearing his throat and nodding. “That’s good.”</p><p>“Glad I could be of assistance. Let me show you both out.”</p><p>As they walked back to the Impala, Dean said. “Wouldn’t mind studying her sleep.” Frowning, he added, “Wait. That came out like stalker talk.”</p><p>“Little bit.”</p><p>“Just saying. We clicked. Nothing wrong with that,” Dean said. “Unless you saw a mad scientist laboratory in there I somehow missed.”</p><p>“Don’t know, Dean,” Sam said. “All those sensors on sleeping people. Maybe they’re recording nightmares and playing them back later in town.”</p><p>“You’re not serious...”</p><p>Sam smirked and shook his head.</p><p>“Good one,” Dean said. Then his mind drifted back to Sophie and he whistled appreciatively. “Think she lets that hair down after hours?”</p><p>“Relax, Dean,” Sam said, grinning. “She was humoring you.”</p><p>“She was undressing me with her eyes.”</p><p>“That had ‘don’t call me, I’ll call you’ written all over it.”</p><p>Dean’s cell phone rang.</p><p>“A-ha! That was fast.” He glanced at the display. “Crap.”</p><p>“Not her?”</p><p>Dean shook his head and took the call.</p><p>“Chief Quinn? Checking in or...?”</p><p>The Winchesters climbed into the Impala. Dean waited until he finished the call before starting the engine. Putting his phone away, Dean frowned as he turned the ignition.</p><p>“What was that about?”</p><p>“Chief says we have some explaining to do.”</p><p>“He’s blaming us for this?”</p><p>“Who knows? He’s in denial about most of it.”</p><p>“Can you handle him alone?”</p><p>“Why? You got somewhere to be?”</p><p>“Someone I should talk to.”</p><p>“You want me to guess?”</p><p>“Olga Kucharski,” Sam said. “This started with the Charger. And there’ve been two deadly incidents involving that car.”</p><p>“A car that belonged to her dead grandson.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean dropped Sam off at Olga Kuckarski’s house, in the less affluent south end of Clayton Falls, where the homes were closer together on smaller lots. According to Lucy Quinn, the woman rarely left her house. Dean waited at the curb in the Impala while Sam rang the doorbell. Less than a minute later, a weary gray-haired woman in a rumpled, shapeless housedress opened the door and squinted up at Sam, who showed her his FBI laminate. She frowned, nodded and waved him inside.</p><p>Satisfied Sam wouldn’t be standing around for the next hour or so waiting for the woman to return from grocery shopping, Dean drove north to Welker Street, turned left and then right onto Main. He parked in the municipal lot behind the Clayton Falls Apparel Company memorial. Cars occupied about a quarter of the lot. Considering it was a Saturday, Dean imagined many township employees were off for the weekend.</p><p>Dean walked past the curved memorial, right over the spot where he’d shot the man stricken with nightmare-Ebola. Glancing down at the sidewalk, he marveled at the complete absence of blood. Vanished without a trace. Same as the Nazi zombies. In the harsh light of day, he could almost believe everything had been a regular nightmare. But then he remembered the dissolved flesh and bones of Harvey Dufford and wondered if the paramedics had found a way to extricate his embedded remains from the asphalt. Not without a jackhammer and a backhoe, he thought.</p><p>In the police department lobby, he told Millie, the dispatcher, that Chief Quinn was expecting him. She nodded and buzzed him through. This time the inner sanctum was bustling with uniforms. Dean spotted at least two shift sergeants and a dozen patrol officers, conferring with each other, hacking away at computer keyboards, printing and collecting forms and photos for report binders. Wild and Cerasi spoke together in low tones, the former sparing a brief nod to Dean before returning to her conversation.</p><p>Sitting at his desk over a flurry of paperwork, Officer Jeffries belatedly covered a yawn when he saw Dean approaching.</p><p>“Crazy night, huh?” he said.</p><p>“You look like hell, Jeffries.”</p><p>“Pulled a double shift yesterday,” he said. “Off duty now, but something tells me I’m not getting out of here anytime soon. What about you? Sleep in that suit?”</p><p>“Sleep is for wimps,” Dean said. “Chief Quinn?”</p><p>“In his office.”</p><p>Dean knocked on the closed door and waited for the old man to invite him inside. The spartan office seemed more severe than it had the first time Dean saw it. Although the grim expression on the police chief ‘s face, along with the sight of his clenched fists resting on a mound of police report folders stacked in the middle of his desk might have contributed to the chill in the room.</p><p>“Close the door,” Quinn said. “Take a seat.”</p><p>Dean complied. “How’s your daughter?”</p><p>Quinn’s eyes flickered to Lucy’s graduation photo on the corner of his desk and he frowned. “Upset, naturally. She lost a good friend. Two now. But she’s sticking with her ridiculous story. I’m not sure I can help her unless I get some reliable information.”</p><p>“No luck finding the car?” Dean asked, even though he knew the car wouldn’t exist until the next time it manifested. Humor the man, he reminded himself.</p><p>“None,” Quinn said. “Probably under a tarp in a garage somewhere. But I’ve got nothing to go on.”</p><p>“You wanted to see me,” Dean prompted.</p><p>“You and your partner,” Quinn said. “Where is he?”</p><p>“Following a lead,” Dean said, reluctant to go into details. Technically, Olga Kucharski was a grieving grandmother, not a witness to any of the living nightmares. The Chief might not approve of them troubling an old woman with no apparent connection to the town’s troubles. “How can I help?”</p><p>“You can start by telling me what the hell is happening to my town,” Quinn said. “Half my officers out there are convinced they’ve seen zombies or that giant monsters are attacking residents.”</p><p>“We warned you about the hallucinogen,” Dean said.</p><p>“And I was disinclined to believe you at the time.”</p><p>“But now?”</p><p>“Now I’m willing to concede that something is causing people to hallucinate, but something else is going on.” He slapped a hand down on the top folder on his desk. “Do you know what’s in here?”</p><p>“I can imagine.”</p><p>“There are photos of a human being who looks like a halfmelted Popsicle.”</p><p>“I saw that in person. Nasty.”</p><p>“Jeffries told me,” Quinn said. “He also told me that two witnesses blame a giant spider for the attack.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, a tarantula.”</p><p>“It was not a tarantula.”</p><p>“It wasn’t?”</p><p>“Of course it wasn’t a giant spider! That’s just what they saw.”</p><p>“Ahh...” Dean said, nodding.</p><p>“That part is the hallucinogen. I get it. What I don’t get is what’s really going on here. Samples were taken to the lab. I won’t have a report anytime soon, but I’ll go out on a limb and say it was some sort of acid.”</p><p>“Some sort of bioterror agent,” Dean said, trying to couch the seriousness of the situation in a manner the pragmatic lawman could accept.</p><p>Quinn snapped his fingers.</p><p>“Exactly. A psychotropic drug to create false impressions of what’s happening. Unreliable witnesses. Damn sneaky, if you ask me.”</p><p>“That’s one possibility.”</p><p>“What I’m grappling with here is the scope of this attack,” Chief Quinn said, nodding thoughtfully. “I know you saved a child at the Qwik Mart sinkhole. Good work.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“And some jackass was crushed by his own car.”</p><p>“Tried to warn him.”</p><p>“Some people never listen.”</p><p>Dean frowned briefly, wondering if the police chief was inadvertently—or subconsciously—referring to himself. No matter what his officers told him, he was determined to find his own explanations.</p><p>“We’ve had a nasty storm, lost some power lines, car accidents and that awful tree accident that killed Max Barnes, none of which I can blame on terrorist activity. Well, there is the matter of the tree being relocated to the middle of the street, which makes no sense. Damn prank, if you ask me. Why would a terrorist move a tree? The sinkhole? They occur naturally and some are frighteningly large. Unless you expect me to believe in some kind of subterranean sabotage, right? A terrorist cell, embedded for years, having some hand in local construction?”</p><p>“It’s possible.”</p><p>Chief Quinn drummed his fingers on the mound of police reports.</p><p>“Something on your mind, Chief?”</p><p>“I told you this was a quiet town,” he said. “And it has been. But this isn’t over yet, is it?”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “Not until we find... whoever is responsible. No.”</p><p>Quinn tugged on his earlobe, a deep frown on his face.</p><p>“I have a captain, four shift sergeants, thirty patrol officers, a couple of detectives and administrative staff at my disposal. More than enough to handle the usual level of madness. But I find my officers compromised by these... hallucinations. I’ve asked all of them to work double shifts until we put an end to this.”</p><p>“Sounds good,” Dean said. Unless Sam and he stopped whatever supernatural agent was bringing nightmares to life, the level of violence in Clayton Falls would only get worse. Until then, an all-hands-on-deck mentality would, he hoped, save some lives.</p><p>“Good,” the chief echoed. “But not good enough.”</p><p>“Have you considered enforcing a town-wide curfew?” Dean suggested. But the more he thought about it, the more impractical it seemed. It might stop the public violence, but it wouldn’t stop people from sleeping and having nightmares. The terror would migrate to more homes, like the Barnes house.</p><p>“Not enough evidence,” Quinn said. “I can’t issue a curfew because of some phantom menace. Storms and sinkholes? No, we’ll handle this proactively. With manpower.”</p><p>“Manpower?”</p><p>“One of the reasons I asked you to check in was to let you know I have a call in to the Colorado State Patrol.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“Yes,” Quinn said. “For backup and support. Half-dozen extra bodies arriving here tonight. Possibly more. They’ll report to me, naturally. Just thought you should know.”</p><p>“I appreciate that, Chief,” Dean said. “Can I make a suggestion?”</p><p>“Let’s hear it.”</p><p>“Have them patrol in pairs.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because if they’re alone, they might not believe what they see,” Dean said. “Hesitation could be fatal. A second set of eyes could make all the difference.”</p><p>Quinn nodded. “Good point, since I don’t even believe what they saw. Suppose the hallucinogenic effect might vary between them.”</p><p>“That, too,” Dean said reluctantly. Whatever gets the job done, he reasoned. “Anything else?”</p><p>“That’s all for now,” Quinn said. “We’ll talk soon.”</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, rising to leave. He paused at the door. “About Lucy.”</p><p>“What about her?”</p><p>“Is she being careful?”</p><p>“She has a shift at C.J.’s,” Quinn said. “I told her to go straight home after. And stay there.”</p><p>“Good,” Dean said. He paused again, halfway through the doorway. “Will she listen?”</p><p>“Truthfully? I don’t know. Maybe. I hope so.”</p><p>“Me too,” Dean said. If the Charger returned for a third night, he had no doubt she would be its target.</p><p>Dean closed Quinn’s door on the way out and was about to navigate a path through the gathered police officers, when Jeffries called him over. A young policewoman had turned a chair around to face Jeffries’ desk and had two folders open, side by side. A quick glance revealed they were the case files for the Gila monster and tarantula attacks.</p><p>“Jeffries?” Dean said.</p><p>“Chief tell you he’s calling in the State Patrol?”</p><p>“No offense,” Dean said. “But you’ll need all the help you can get.”</p><p>“None taken.”</p><p>The police woman stood and faced Dean.</p><p>Jeffries made introductions. “Agent DeYoung, Senior Patrol Officer Carleen Phillips.”</p><p>Dean shook her offered hand.</p><p>“You’re looking at terrorists for this?” she asked with a nod toward the file folders on the desk.</p><p>“That’s our working theory.”</p><p>She picked up the two monster attack folders, stared at them and shook her head in disbelief. “Weird, you know? Like something out of Nightmare Theater.”</p><p>For a moment, Dean wondered if she had somehow stumbled onto the Winchesters’ actual theory and not their cover story. Not possible, he thought. Even the people they told outright couldn’t accept it. And by ‘people’ he was thinking about Sophie Bessette. A few moments passed before he realized his mind had wandered and both Jeffries and Phillips were looking at him as if they expected some kind of coherent response.</p><p>“A bioterrorism agent affecting the subconscious might be involved,” Dean said and hoped it sounded plausible, even though it was a bunch of bull. Sam would have had better luck selling that line. Dean cleared his throat. “How’s the coffee here?”</p><p>Phillips grinned. “An acquired taste.”</p><p>“Three parts battery acid, one part roofing tar,” Jeffries said.</p><p>“Beggars can’t be choosers,” Dean said. “Lead the way.”</p><p>Entering Olga Kuckarski’s house, Sam’s first impression was of musty gloom. Dark curtains and blinds obstructed most of the light that attempted to enter through the windows. Dark paneling encased the bottom half of the walls; dingy wallpaper with designs too faded to distinguish covered the top. But most of the walls were fronted with dark wooden bookshelves packed with old hardbound books steeped in dust and mildew, and bulky hutches filled with worthless bric-a-brac—collections of snow globes, ceramic fish and frogs and turtles, tiny bottles filled with multi-colored sand, oriental fans. The glass doors on the hutches kept the dust away from the interior shelves, but every other surface looked as if it hadn’t been cleaned in a long time.</p><p>Sam wasn’t surprised by the old woman’s inattention to house cleaning. She walked with difficulty, hunched over with labored breathing, her arms trembling. As she led him down a cramped hallway to the kitchen, Sam’s gaze wandered to a framed portrait of Lech Walesa. A small bronze plate bolted to the bottom of the frame listed the dates Walesa served as Poland’s president. Paired with the portrait in a matching frame was a map of Poland. A freestanding bookshelf on the opposite wall displayed books that—unlike those in the towering monuments of mildew he passed earlier—looked as if they had actually been read or perused in the last decade. These books covered a wide variety of topics, all dealing with Poland: multiple volumes on the history of the country, volumes on life during wartime, the changing face of politics, the legends and folklore, famous people, tourism, music, literature, sports, geography and demographics, even several cookbooks. The woman had access to anything she’d ever want to know about her country of origin.</p><p>In the small kitchen, which had enough floor space for a table and four chairs but not much else, she opened a cabinet above her head and reached for two glasses. When Sam saw her hands trembling, he stepped forward and said, “Allow me.”</p><p>“I’m not helpless, you know?” she responded sharply.</p><p>“I’m a guest in your house,” Sam said. “I want to help.”</p><p>“Don’t have any fancy bottled water.”</p><p>“Tap’s fine,” Sam said.</p><p>He filled two glasses and set them on opposite sides of the table. When he reached to pull back a chair for her, she smacked his hand away.</p><p>“Enough of the Boy Scout crap,” she said. “State your business, young man.”</p><p>Sam waited as she fumbled with the chair, pushing it back with the edge of a curled fist before plopping down in apparent exhaustion. When she was settled with her ragged breathing under control, he sat down and took a sip of water. The center of the table held a framed photo and a vase of flowers a few days past fresh.</p><p>“I’m sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Kucharski,” Sam said. “I was hoping you could answer a few questions for me about your grandson.”</p><p>“Teodor? You’re here about Teodor? Little late, aren’t you?” she said bitterly. “They let him die a year ago.”</p><p>“Who let him die?”</p><p>“Sad excuses for friends, that’s who,” she said. “Let him drive after he’d been drinking. And that girl. Chief ‘s kid. Teddy was too good for her.”</p><p>“They were all in the car with him when he crashed.”</p><p>“Of course they were,” she said, her voice rising. “But only my boy died! Teodor was a good Polish boy. He deserved better.” Her hand trembled as she raised the glass to her lips, water nearly sloshing over the rim before she took a sip. “He was the only family I had left. If they were real friends, they would have kept him out of that car...”</p><p>“I’m sorry for your loss.”</p><p>She was quiet for a time and Sam debated excusing himself, but just as he was about to stand, she began to speak again.</p><p>“He loved that car,” she said. “That’s all his father had to leave him. When Piotr, my son, bought that car, I thought it was a waste of money. But he rebuilt it, piece by piece. Took him years. A labor of love. And Teodor took real good care of it until...”</p><p>“It was a horrible accident.”</p><p>“Horrible for Teodor,” she said. “His so-called friends walked away from it.”</p><p>“I understand they were all injured.”</p><p>She scoffed with a dismissive wave of her hand.</p><p>“Injuries? More like inconveniences. And they got off with a slap on the wrist. That girl, she has connections. Father’s the police chief. Special treatment for her. And for those boys—“</p><p>“You are aware that Steve Bullinger and Tony Lacosta are both dead?”</p><p>“What? Dead?” She frowned at him. “How should I know? I don’t read the papers and the TV news is too depressing. Why should I watch?”</p><p>“They were both killed by a hit-and-run driver.”</p><p>“Ha! Imagine that,” she said, shaking her head. “Like that old movie, The Postman Always Rings Twice. Maybe they should have died in the accident that killed my Teodor. What’s that they say? Living on borrowed time.”</p><p>“The same car hit both of them. Tony last night. Steve the night before.”</p><p>“What? You think I did it? I don’t drive no more. Take the bus or bum a ride.”</p><p>Sam leaned forward. “The odd thing is,” he said and watched her reaction. “The car that hit them was a ‘68 Charger. Red with a white stripe down the hood.”</p><p>She looked puzzled, frowning again. “Teodor’s car?”</p><p>“Identical.”</p><p>“Impossible,” she said. “The car was wrecked. Dumped in a junkyard. Saw it with my own two eyes. I went down there, to claim it... but it was a mess. There’s no one to rebuild it anymore.”</p><p>“Can you think of anyone who would want revenge?”</p><p>“I was his only family,” she said. “And I’m in no condition to run down a bunch of teenaged hooligans.”</p><p>“Other friends?”</p><p>“He had a blind spot for those three. Wasn’t anybody else,” she said. “I’m the only one who cares that Teodor’s gone.”</p><p>“Lucy Quinn cared for him a great deal.”</p><p>“I’m sure that’s what she tells everyone,” the old woman said dismissively. “It’s all about sympathy for her.”</p><p>A coughing fit seized her, turning her pale, lined face beet red.</p><p>As Sam started to rise, she waved him off and drank some water.</p><p>Sam lowered himself in the chair. He reached for the framed photo on the table, turned it toward him and looked closer: A smiling woman with graying hair stood next to a teenaged boy in a shirt and tie in front of a church.</p><p>“Is this you with Teodor?” Sam asked, startled.</p><p>“Of course it is.”</p><p>“When was this picture taken?”</p><p>“About... eighteen months ago,” she said. “That girl took it, after she came to church with us. Kissing up, was all that was. But it’s a good picture of Teodor.”</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said slowly, setting it down. “Yes, it is...”</p><p>The woman in the photo was hardly recognizable as the person sitting across from him. Tragedy and illness and stress had a way of aging people beyond their years, but the effect in this case was extreme. In eighteen months, Olga Kucharski looked as if she’d aged twenty-five years. Something occurred to Sam, but he’d have to approach it delicately.</p><p>“How was your relationship with Teodor?”</p><p>“Fine,” she said proudly. “We were family. The only family each of us had. We took care of each other.”</p><p>“You’d make sure he went to school, did his schoolwork, got plenty of sleep.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And he’d make sure you were taking care of yourself.”</p><p>“Naturally,” she said. “I’m sometimes forgetful. He’d remind me to take my medicine.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Sam said. “Family taking care of family.”</p><p>“That’s how it is,” she said, nodding. “You have any family?”</p><p>“A brother.”</p><p>“Then you know.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “So Teodor would make sure you had regular checkups.”</p><p>“Of course,” she said. “He would drive me wherever I needed to go.”</p><p>“But now you have to remember all that stuff on your own,” Sam said. “For instance, when was the last time you saw your doctor.”</p><p>“I stopped going to the doctor,” she said with a bitter laugh. “When I lost Teddy, it didn’t matter no more. Who cares what happens to a lonely old woman?”</p><p>“You must have friends here. Neighbors.”</p><p>“It’s not the same,” she said with another flick of her hand. “Besides, the only doctor I need, I see every night.”</p><p>“I’m sorry?”</p><p>“Heh! All right, c’mon, I’ll show you.”</p><p>As she painfully pushed herself up out of her chair, Sam rose to help her. But again she refused any assistance. Once on her feet, she paused to catch her breath and took another quick sip of water. Breathing audibly, almost with a wheeze, she walked back down the narrow hallway. Instead of heading to the door, she turned right into a dark living room with a twenty-seven inch television, a threadbare green-checked sofa behind a small coffee table, and a worn recliner with an antimacassar draped over the headrest. Beside the recliner, which was pointed toward the television set, a small table held a lamp, a remote control, and a folded newspaper TV schedule.</p><p>“I don’t sleep good,” she said. “Not since Teodor’s passing. Toss and turn in my bed, so I come down and watch television until I nod off. He’s on late at night, when I can’t sleep.”</p><p>As Olga Kucharski approached the TV, Sam’s gaze drifted across the walls and discovered more than two dozen photos of Teodor Kucharski. From baby photos through high school, it was possible to trace the growth and development of the woman’s grandson. He imagined that most of the photos had gone up on the walls after the boy’s death, making the room a shrine, each age in each photo a memory trigger for her to recall a different time in Teodor’s life. On top of the television, a more recent photo was bracketed by two glass vases filled with flowers about as fresh as the bouquet in the kitchen.</p><p>She probably brings home fresh flowers from the supermarket each week, he thought. He was reminded of the garment factory fire memorial, a communal mourning, shared by the whole town. But here, in this house, Olga Kucharski battled her grief alone.</p><p>“Started watching him every night. A habit. Now he’s like an old friend. And he’s from Clayton Falls. Met him once, at the movie rental place over in the strip mall downtown. That’s where I got this,” she said, pointing to a spot on the wall above the television. Or, more specifically, a framed eight-byten photo. The only picture in the room not of her grandson.</p><p>Sam stepped forward to examine the subject in the glossy publicity photo: a man theatrically costumed as a mad scientist. Probably in his mid-sixties—though his zombie makeup made his true age hard to guess—the man had a shock of white hair and startled-wide eyes. He wore a long white PVC lab coat smeared with stage blood. In one hand he held an Erlenmeyer flask filled with neon-green fluid emitting tendrils of white smoke. The other hand gestured at the improbable concoction as if to announce to the world that he’d finally made his deranged breakthrough, a B-movie lunatic’s eureka moment.</p><p>“He’s Polish, too,” Mrs. Kucharski said as Sam examined the photo. “I had him sign his real name: Jozef Wieczorek. I knew it because of an article in the paper. Most people just know him by his TV name. Since Teodor died, he’s the only ‘doctor’ I need.”</p><p>Sam looked at the bottom of the photo, where the guy’s character name was preprinted in dripping blood-red script letters.</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Dr. Gruesome?” Dean asked. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Well, that’s not his real name,” Senior Officer Carleen Phillips said.</p><p>She stood next to Dean in the small break room, on the other side of the coffee station, sipping her steaming mug o’ joe as if it wasn’t also burning a hole through her stomach lining. Dean wasn’t so fortunate. The stuff was foul.</p><p>“Read it once. Hard to remember or pronounce.”</p><p>Jeffries smiled. “And Dr. Gruesome rolls off the tongue.”</p><p>“This Nightmare Theater is real?”</p><p>“Sure,” Jeffries said. “On the air a couple years now. Late-night horror movies. Mostly old stuff. Dr. Gruesome comments during the commercial breaks.”</p><p>“And he lives here in town?”</p><p>“Yeah, but you might not recognize him without the mad scientist getup and zombie makeup.”</p><p>Dean glanced up at the TV mounted on an adjustable metal arm in the corner of the break room.</p><p>“You have a guide for that?” he asked.</p><p>“Sure,” Phillips said. “There it is. On top of the microwave. But the show’s not on now.”</p><p>Dean grabbed the thin newsprint TV Weekly magazine and flipped to the listing for the previous night, then the night before, working his way back to the start of the week.</p><p>“I’ll be damned,” he whispered. He looked up at the two cops. “I need to talk to this guy.”</p><p>“You know who you should ask?” Phillips said. “Millie, our dispatcher. Dr. Gruesome’s her cousin.”</p><p>“That’s right,” Jeffries said. “She’ll have his address or phone number.”</p><p>Dean tossed the magazine on the table and hurried toward the lobby exit.</p><p>Jeffries called after him.</p><p>“You don’t think he’s a terrorist, do you?”</p><p>Hurrying across Main Street toward the Impala parked in the municipal lot, Dean called Sam on his cell phone.</p><p>“Sam, I got something.”</p><p>“Me too,” Sam said. “Pick me up at Olga Kuchkarski’s.”</p><p>Dean retraced his route and found Sam standing impatiently at the curb.</p><p>Once Sam was inside the car, he said, “She’s not directly involved. Seemed genuinely surprised Bullinger and Lacosta were dead. But she has a connection to somebody who may be behind this. Even has a photo of him in the middle of dozens of her grandson.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Dean said. “Dr. Gruesome.”</p><p>“What? How did you—?”</p><p>“TV host for a show called—“</p><p>“Nightmare Theater.”</p><p>“Right. I flipped through the TV listings for the week,” Dean said. “Know what I found?”</p><p>“Movies this week featured a headless horseman, a giant Gila monster and a giant tarantula.” Off Dean’s surprised look, Sam added, “Mrs. Kucharski’s a big fan of the show. I checked her guide.”</p><p>“I got us one thing, you didn’t,” Dean said with a wry smile.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“An appointment,” Dean said. “Of sorts.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Talked to Cousin Millie.”</p><p>Dean glanced at the address Millie had written on a sticky note.</p><p>“Should be right up ahead,” Dean said. “Dr. Gruesome, a.k.a. Jozef Wieczorek, rents studio time here.”</p><p>He parked the Impala in the lot behind a long redbrick building that—according to the sign in the front lawn—housed the headquarters of the local cable company. The Winchester brothers approached the rear door which was protected by an overhang the width of an umbrella. Though the door had a keypad and card reader, Dean gave the handle a tug. Locked.</p><p>“State your business,” a voice squawked from a speaker above the keypad.</p><p>Sam noticed a security camera mounted above the door. He took out his FBI credentials and held them close to the camera lens.</p><p>Dean pressed a black button above the speaker.</p><p>“FBI. Agents DeYoung and Shaw. We have an appointment to see Jozef—Dr. Gruesome.”</p><p>A moment later the door buzzed.</p><p>Dean grabbed the handle and pulled it open.</p><p>They entered a battleship-gray lobby with a scuffed gray linoleum floor. Several molded gray plastic chairs lined the near wall, positioned on either side of a small gray table piled with jumbled newspapers Dean had the impression that all color had suddenly been leached out of the world. On the far side of the lobby, a security guard with droopy eyes, bushy sideburns and a noticeable beer gut sat inside what looked like a bulletproof glass booth.</p><p>“Guarding the crown jewels in here?” Dean said in an undertone to Sam.</p><p>The guard leaned forward and spoke into a microphone. His gravelly voice came through speakers mounted at the top of the glass booth.</p><p>“Down the hall, first right. Studio’s second door on your left. If the red light is on above the door, wait until it goes off.”</p><p>After those terse instructions, the guard pressed a button on his console. The inner door, adjacent to the guard booth, buzzed. Dean stepped forward and opened it.</p><p>“Have a wonderful day,” Dean said before letting the door close behind him and Sam. Guy gave good directions, Dean thought. In a few moments, they reached the studio door where a red light mounted atop it was indeed aglow.</p><p>Beneath the light, with her back pressed to the door, stood a frazzled-looking woman in her mid-thirties holding a clipboard in her crossed arms. As they approached, she turned her head toward them.</p><p>“Agents DeYoung and Shaw,” Dean said.</p><p>“Just a minute or two,” she said.</p><p>“Dr. Gruesome in there?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Redoing a few prerecorded bits. Perfectionist.”</p><p>“And you are?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Sandy DeSio, his producer, technical director, sometimes scriptwriter, and occasional director. Most of us juggle multiple crew positions.”</p><p>“Is the show national?” Sam asked.</p><p>“He’s national,” she said, “If you get NMC in your cable or satellite package.”</p><p>“No offense,” Sam said. “But I’ve never heard of Dr. Gruesome or Nightmare Theater.”</p><p>“Nightmare Theater isn’t a show, per se,” she said. “NMC’s a twenty-four hour movie channel. They were airing old horror movies late night and decided they needed to add some, I don’t know, pizzazz. Joe—Jozef—has a friend at NMC. Found out what they were looking for, sent an audition tape and got the job. We prescreen the movies and record a series of interstitials that play during commercial breaks.”</p><p>“Interstitials?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Basically, short commentaries on what’s happening in the movie as we go into and come out of commercial breaks. We tape fifteen to twenty bits for each movie, about twenty to thirty minutes of material, depending on the runtime of the movie.”</p><p>“So it’s like the viewer is watching the movie with Dr. Gruesome,” Sam said.</p><p>“Exactly,” Sandy said. “Technically, Dr. Gruesome is presenting the movie. Then he makes comments on it throughout. With a mad zombie scientist as your host, it’s obviously cheesy and campy, but the ratings improved about twenty percent with the segments.”</p><p>Sam turned to Dean. “Olga Kucharski said Dr. Gruesome had become like a friend.”</p><p>“That’s especially true of his fans in Clayton Falls,” Sandy said. “Home town celebrity. Local pride.”</p><p>“Mad scientist next door,” Dean said.</p><p>“Right,” Sandy said, forcing a smile. “All in fun.”</p><p>“You have no idea.”</p><p>Off her confused look, Dean pointed above her head to where the red light bulb had gone dark.</p><p>“Oh, right,” she said with a quick smile. “Cute. Let’s go.”</p><p>They followed her inside the studio. A control room behind glass on their right faced three cameras on wheeled tripods focused on the mad scientist laboratory set, which consisted of a single three-walled room. The walls were covered with a faux stone texture. The broad side of a lab table occupied the foreground, its surface covered with various beakers and flasks and test tubes filled with multicolored liquids, and a Bunsen burner. Mounted to the walls was a steampunk-inspired network of glass tubes and meters attached to polished brass and iron piping, wheels, gears and levers. In keeping with the intent of a show called Nightmare Theater, the sprawling contraption looked functional and slightly ominous. But everything that looked metallic was, in all likelihood, painted plastic.</p><p>Two camera operators huddled around a short bald man wearing a headset.</p><p>“Al Dornfeld, our floor director,” Sandy said as she led them toward the man in zombie makeup wearing smudged goggles pushed up on his forehead, a white PVC lab coat and black gloves that extended to his elbows. “And this... is our star, Dr. Gruesome.”</p><p>The man pulled off his gloves and offered his hand.</p><p>“Call me Joe,” he said with a pleasant smile that ruined the zombie effect. “I’m only a mad scientist returned from the dead by his own diabolical experiments while the cameras are on.”</p><p>“Agents DeYoung and Shaw,” Dean said.</p><p>“Right,” Wieczorek said, “FBI. I can’t imagine why, but Millie said you had some questions for me.”</p><p>“Hold that thought for a second,” Sandy said. “Joe, I’ll need to talk to you about scheduling when you’re through with these gentlemen.” She patted him on the shoulder before walking to the control room.</p><p>“Sure, Sandy,” Wieczorek called after her. Then he whispered to the Winchesters, “I know I drive her crazy sometimes. But it’s my reputation on the air. My brand.”</p><p>“Mr. Wiec—Joe,” Sam said, “Are you aware of what’s happening in town?”</p><p>“This show keeps me busy,” Wieczorek said. “We’re on every night. So I don’t often catch the news or read the paper. But I heard something about storm damage, power outages, and a big sinkhole at a convenience store—the Qwik Mart. And a hit and run. Two in two days. Awful. Oh, and somebody said a man died falling out of a tree.”</p><p>“The man was killed by the tree,” Dean said.</p><p>“Not the fall? I’m afraid I don’t understand.”</p><p>“The tree stabbed the man.”</p><p>“My hearing’s not what it was,” he said. “Did you just say a ‘tree stabbed a man?’”</p><p>“With a branch,” Dean said. “But that’s not why we’re here.”</p><p>“Thank heavens,” he said. “Why are you here?”</p><p>“Several police officers, Agent DeYoung and I witnessed other incidents last night that have a connection to your show,” Sam said. “A man was killed by a giant tarantula. The night before, another man was attacked by a giant Gila monster. That same night, three teens were chased by a headless horseman.”</p><p>As Sam spoke, Wieczorek’s smile faltered and faded, but then his eyes widened and he chuckled, clapping his hands together in delight.</p><p>“Okay, this is somebody’s idea of a joke, right? Hidden camera. It’s Sandy getting payback, right?”</p><p>“No joke,” Dean said. “Two local men witnessed the tarantula attack.”</p><p>Again, Wieczorek’s smiled faded by degrees, a bit faster this time. He looked from Dean to Sam and back again.</p><p>“Either you have the best poker faces I’ve ever seen or... You are serious.”</p><p>He reached a hand out sideways and grabbed the edge of the laboratory table for support, then took a deep breath.</p><p>“These are popcorn movies, harmless entertainment...” he said. “I don’t understand. This stuff isn’t real. It can’t be real. It’s pure fantasy.”</p><p>“Something is making it become real,” Sam said.</p><p>“And we need to know if that something is you,” Dean added.</p><p>“Me? How could I...? How could anyone...?”</p><p>“Have you met anyone unusual lately?” Sam asked. “Found a strange old coin? Come across a peculiar antique? Received an odd inheritance?”</p><p>“What? No. Nothing like that. This is a daily routine for me. Screen the movies, work up the script for the interstitials, makeup and props, rehearse, record, edit. On television it may all look strange and surreal, but for us it’s... routine. Mundane, even.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. “You got any ideas?”</p><p>Sam nodded, turned to Wieczorek. “Do you remember a woman name Olga Kucharski?”</p><p>“Olga... Olga Kucharski? No. Should I...?” He snapped his fingers. “Wait—Olga—is she an older woman? Ha! Look who’s talking? No spring chicken myself. But I do remember a woman from one of my personal appearances. Very much into her Polish heritage. Seemed delighted to learn I was Polish too. Had me sign my full name on a publicity photo. Said it would have a place of honor in her home.”</p><p>“That would be the lady,” Sam said. “Have you had any other dealings with her?”</p><p>“Dealings? No, nothing. She’s a fan of the show. Said she watches every night.” He shrugged. “I believe that appearance was the one and only time I ever met her. But she did leave an impression.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam, who gave him a barely perceptible shrug. They were both stumped.</p><p>“Just out of curiosity, Doc,” Dean said. “What movie are you working on now?”</p><p>Wieczorek beamed. “Ah, a wonderfully cheesy, space invasion flick. About aliens with lobster-claw hands that crack open human skulls and suck out the brains with their tentacle-like proboscis.”</p><p>“You gotta be kidding me,” Dean said.</p><p>“How do we kill them?” Sam asked.</p><p>“If I tell you, it will spoil the movie.”</p><p>Dean rolled his eyes. “We don’t care about the friggin’ movie!”</p><p>“Oh, of course,” Wieczorek said and frowned. “They’re bulletproof, because of their exoskeletons. So the National Guard kills them with flamethrowers. Cooks them, actually. Ends with a joke about lobster bibs.”</p><p>Dean turned to Sam. “Dude, we’ve got zero flamethrowers in the Impala.”</p><p>“We’ll improvise,” Sam said. “Aerosol cans and cigarette lighters.”</p><p>“Wait,” Wieczorek said, catching Sam’s arm. “How do you believe these movie creations become real?”</p><p>“People have nightmares,” Sam said. “The nightmares manifest in town somewhere.”</p><p>Wieczorek looked as if he wanted to request a thorough examination of their FBI credentials, but then decided against it.</p><p>“Even if that is somehow possible, the aliens won’t be a problem.”</p><p>“How so?” Dean asked.</p><p>“We tape our interstitials a week ahead,” he explained. “Nobody will see this movie until next Saturday.”</p><p>“Good,” Sam said. “One less nightmare scenario to worry about.”</p><p>“Unless, of course, somebody in my crew has a nightmare about it.”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said.</p><p>“I wouldn’t worry. We watch the movies so many times while working on our scripts that they lose any shock value they might have,” Wieczorek said. “If anybody here has a nightmare, it would be about working overtime or not making a deadline.”</p><p>“Thanks for your help,” Sam said. “Wait. What’s tonight’s feature?”</p><p>“Oh, yes! Wolves.”</p><p>“Werewolves?” Dean asked apprehensively.</p><p>“No, regular wolves,” Wieczorek said. “Maybe a bit large. And there’s a pack of them. And... they’re all rabid. They invade a small town and rip...”</p><p>“We get the idea,” Dean said. “Thanks.”</p><p>As the Winchesters walked toward the studio door, Wieczorek called out for them to wait. They stopped and turned back.</p><p>“Listen, I can’t help but think how crazy this all sounds,” he said. “And I promise you we have not changed our routine at all. I can’t imagine a scenario where what you say is even possible...”</p><p>“Your point?” Dean asked.</p><p>“If what you say is true, and I have no reason to doubt you, I can’t ignore the fact that something unexplainable is happening and that it is somehow connected to my show. A man attacked by a giant tarantula...”</p><p>“Want to see police report photos of the half-eaten victim?”</p><p>“That’s quite all right,” Wieczorek said. “I’m trying to say that I feel partly responsible for whatever is happening here. I want to help, but...” He raised his shoulders, hands spread. “I’m not sure what I can do.”</p><p>“You want to help?” Dean said. “Convince NMC not to run the wolf movie.”</p><p>“Not run it?”</p><p>“Preempt it,” Sam said. “With Lassie Come Home or something?”</p><p>Wieczorek pursed his lips. “I’ll try. But I don’t know if they’ll believe me. Or listen. Maybe they can black out this market.”</p><p>“Do what you can,” Dean said.</p><p>“I will,” he said. “But the nature of nightmares is that they linger.”</p><p>“We know,” Sam said.</p><p>“Oh, and I’ll talk to Millie,” Wieczorek said. “She’ll have a record of all the emergency calls. Maybe that will help.”</p><p>“Knock yourself out,” Dean said.</p><p>His mind had already leapt ahead, considering the likelihood that he and Sam would be shooting rabid wolves in several hours. At least wolves—unlike lobster-clawed aliens—weren’t immune to bullets. As they exited the studio, Dean looked back and saw Sandy rejoin Wieczorek, handing him a towel to begin removing his makeup. The old man stared after the Winchesters, but his gaze seemed unfocused, lost in thought, a pensive zombie.</p><p>Dean and Sam retraced their steps to the lobby.</p><p>“You got anything?” Dean asked. “ ‘Cause I got nothing.”</p><p>“Whatever is happening, it’s connected to Dr. Gruesome’s show and Olga Kucharski,” Sam said. “The Gila monster, the headless horseman, and the Charger started this. If those two are not directly involved, something is using them.”</p><p>“What about the Raptors? And the sinkhole. And Nazi zombies?”</p><p>“Like he said, nightmares linger,” Sam said. “We only checked one week of TV listings. Maybe movies about that stuff aired two weeks ago. Or... maybe not. I don’t know.”</p><p>Exiting the building proved much simpler than entering. The droopy-eyed security guard barely looked up as they passed through the lobby and stepped outside. Sam paused and looked at Dean over the roof of the Impala.</p><p>“I’ve got an idea.”</p><p>“All ears, Sammy.”</p><p>“Let’s go with the premise that Olga Kucharski is patient zero.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“The most significant event in her life is the death of her grandson,” Sam said. “And two of the people who were with him when he died have been killed by the nightmare car.”</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “So we’re back to her?”</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Not directly. But something triggered this. Something about that accident. But I’m missing something.”</p><p>“Sounds like research dead ahead.”</p><p>“I’ll call Bobby. Get him working the nightmare angle.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“Then I need you to drop me off at the Fremont Ledger,” Sam said. “The online archives are a bit thin. I want to check back issues in their morgue, dating back to the accident.”</p><p>“Watch out for that reporter—Nash,” Dean said. “Last thing we need is our pictures all over the paper.”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“While you’re at the Ledger, I have something to check out.”</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“Last survivor of that car accident,” Dean said. “Lucy Quinn. Way I see it, she has a big honkin’ bull’s eye on her back.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’m surprised you asked me here.”</p><p>“I’m surprised you came,” Dean said, smiling.</p><p>“Is this the early bird special?” Sophie Bessette said after taking a cursory glance at the laminated C.J.’s menu she’d plucked from the wire holder next to the paper napkin dispenser.</p><p>“I missed lunch,” Dean said.</p><p>“Don’t FBI agents have expense accounts?”</p><p>“You know how it is. Budget cutbacks,” Dean said. “Besides, I wasn’t sure if this was business or pleasure.”</p><p>“Oh,” Sophie said. “Definitely business.”</p><p>“Too bad,” Dean said. “But they have great cheeseburgers here.”</p><p>“So I’ve heard,” Sophie said. “And yet I’ve managed to avoid the temptation.”</p><p>“We’re still talking cheeseburgers, right?”</p><p>She smiled winsomely. “So far. Yes.”</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>“I’m assuming the crisis is not yet past?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, no.”</p><p>Lucy Quinn approached their booth in her C.J.’s Diner navy blue vest with the red buttons, carrying two glasses of water, which she placed in front of them.</p><p>“Hello again, Agent DeYoung. Are you both ready to order?”</p><p>Sophie cleared her throat. “You serve salads?”</p><p>“House salad,” Lucy said with a slight shrug. “It’s okay. Nothing to write home about.”</p><p>“That will be fine,” Sophie said. “Vinaigrette. On the side.”</p><p>“Cheeseburger and fries,” Dean said. “Lady doesn’t know what she’s missing.”</p><p>Lucy smiled, pulled a pen and order pad from a side pocket in her vest and scrawled down their order quickly.</p><p>“Any appetizers?” she asked. When they declined, she said, “Okay. That’ll be a few minutes. Or do you want the salad brought out right away?”</p><p>“Together is fine,” Sophie said.</p><p>After Lucy left the booth, Dean said, “She look familiar?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sophie said. “I believe she’s the daughter of the chief of police.”</p><p>“Know her any other way?”</p><p>“No,” Sophie said, eyeing him suspiciously. “What are you suggesting?”</p><p>Dean reached into the inside pocket of his jacket and pulled out a list of names he’d written down while waiting for her to show up at the diner. Unfolding the paper, he placed it on the table, flattened the creases and turned it so she could read the names.</p><p>“Is this a list of terror suspects?” she asked him, intrigued.</p><p>“No. I mean, probably not.”</p><p>“Then what?”</p><p>“Look, I know you’re worried about patient confidentiality, so I want you to look at those names and let me know if any are familiar.”</p><p>“I can’t say I’m comfortable with this.”</p><p>“Read the list,” Dean said. “If you don’t know any of the names, fine.”</p><p>“And if any of them are familiar?”</p><p>“I could get a court order,” Dean said. “But let’s cross that bridge when it’s time to blow it up.”</p><p>She sighed. “You realize I don’t treat patients personally? Half of these people could have been patients at Restful Sleep and I’d be oblivious.”</p><p>“I find that hard to believe.”</p><p>“Believe what you want,” she said, but she examined the names, running her manicured index finger down the list slowly enough that Dean knew she was making an honest effort. He watched that finger closely, looking for any telltale pauses beside any particular name, but each one received equal treatment. “No,” she said, eventually. “None of these names are familiar.”</p><p>“Worth a shot.”</p><p>“Who are they?”</p><p>“Witnesses and victims,” Dean said. Lucy Quinn was the only name he’d left off the list. All along, he’d planned on watching Sophie’s reaction to Lucy in person. But her reaction—or non-reaction—had told him nothing.</p><p>After Lucy had set down their plates and walked away, Dean said, “Guess this is pleasure after all.”</p><p>“You wish,” Sophie said, but smiled affably as she picked at her lettuce.</p><p>Hoping Sam was having better luck with newspaper research, Dean tore into his cheeseburger with gusto. She really doesn’t know what she’s missing, he thought. And he was still referring to the cheeseburger.</p><p>Appropriately enough, the morgue of the Fremont Ledger was located in the basement of the newspaper office building. A clerk helped Sam locate the year-old issues of the newspaper, which had been converted to microfiche. Sam started two weeks before the accident that killed Teodor Kucharski, in case anything unusual had precipitated the crash. But there we no mentions of the boy or his grandmother in any of the local stories.</p><p>The day after the accident, the coverage was minimal. Police blotter details. Nothing more. In the days that followed, a few human interest stories appeared, some with reprinted photos of Olga Kucharski and her grandson. Again, Sam marveled that he was looking at photos of the same feeble and sickly woman he’d interviewed a couple of hours ago. The Olga Kucharski in the newspaper photos looked young enough to be her daughter. A sympathetic reporter had interviewed her after the accident to delve into Teodor’s character and personality, and she referred to him as a “good Polish boy” more than once in the interview. The reporter had commented on the pride she had in her Polish heritage and how she’d lost her husband to illness before immigrating to the United States.</p><p>Photos at the crash scene showed the totaled Charger, crumpled like an accordion. Looking at the wreck, Sam shook his head. Hard to believe the other three teens had survived the crash.</p><p>Other newspaper stories dealt with the issue of driving while intoxicated and underage alcohol consumption, drifting from human interest to op-ed. Teodor had become a grim cautionary tale for the youth of Clayton Falls. Less than two weeks after the accident, however, the press coverage ended. Sam skimmed through a month’s worth of microfiche after the last article and found nothing else about Olga or her grandson. Seemed like Teodor Kucharski had been dismissed from the public consciousness.</p><p>The microfiche archive began six months back. According to the clerk, anything more recent would be converted to digital records in parallel with microfiche but neither was available yet.</p><p>Sam pulled hard copies from the time of the Clayton Falls Apparel Company fire. Almost three dozen employees had died in the fire. The press coverage was extensive. Frontpage stories about the explosion that led to the fire, the malfunction of the sprinkler system, the investigation into the cause and culpability of the fire, inspection records, capsule biographies of all the victims. Days and weeks after the fire, longer human interest pieces, detailed profiles of the victims, basically mini biographies covering the entire span of their lives.</p><p>Sam skipped forward weeks and months and found more human interest articles. How families continued to cope with the loss, how they had changed their lives in the wake of the deaths, changed priorities, sons and daughters returned home from college, or changed courses of study, volunteered to help with burn victims, and one high school senior had decided to become a doctor. These articles turned into calls for a memorial, public debate on the memorial’s location and design and when it would be constructed and dedicated, and whether the ruins of the factory would be razed or preserved or rebuilt as a church or a community center.</p><p>During this last batch of articles Sam caught up to the online archive he’d reviewed before he and Dean arrived in town. He returned the hard copies to their shelves and left the building, thanking the helpful clerk on his way out.</p><p>If he looked at the town’s reaction to the two tragedies from Olga Kucharski’s perspective, Sam could understand how she’d feel Teodor had been forgotten. For the last six months, the town had shared a communal grief that excluded her because her personal grief had become too isolating.</p><p>The living nightmares had begun on the one-year anniversary of her grandson’s death. An anniversary forgotten or ignored by everyone but Olga Kucharski. At least that’s how it would seem to the old woman. The living nightmares, however, could not be ignored. They would continue to grab and hold the town’s attention. And that’s why Sam kept returning to her, his patient zero. But if Olga had triggered the living nightmares, he was pretty sure she’d done so unintentionally—or subconsciously.</p><p>Two things had been the focus of her life. Her grandson and her heritage. The Fremont Ledger reporter had noticed it, as had Sam, from the moment he entered her house and saw the Lech Walesa portrait, the map of Poland and the entire bookcase of volumes on...</p><p>Cell phone in hand, Sam stopped at the bottom of the stairs of the Fremont Ledger building.</p><p>Across the street was the Clayton Falls Public Library.</p><p>Pocketing his cell, he crossed the street to the single-story white stone building. As he walked up to the entrance, he saw a brunette in a gray business suit standing with her back to him at the door. He heard a metallic click and realized two things simultaneously: she was the librarian and she’d just locked up for the day.</p><p>She dropped her keys in her pocketbook, turned around and emitted a startled squeal when she saw him standing there.</p><p>“You scared me!” she cried.</p><p>“Sorry,” Sam said. “Bad timing. I need to get in there.”</p><p>“Really bad timing,” she said. “We closed an hour ago. I was cleaning up after everyone left.”</p><p>Sam pulled out his FBI credentials. “It’s a matter of life and death.”</p><p>The woman smiled. “Has that line ever been used in the history of law enforcement in reference to a library?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “First time for everything.”</p><p>“If nothing else, this will make a great article for the library newsletter,” she said as she plucked her keys out and unlocked the door. She held it open for him and followed him inside. “How can I help?”</p><p>“Do you have any books on Poland?” Sam said. “More specifically, Polish legends and folklore?”</p><p>“We have a few books on Poland, some related to World War II,” she said, leading him through the aisles and pointing to the appropriate sections as she spoke. “Any books on myths, folklore, and legend would be in a different section.”</p><p>Sam pulled four volumes on world folklore and legend from the shelves—one title matched a book he’d seen on Olga Kucharski’s bookcase—and carried them back to a long table in front of the checkout counter with a row of four computers connected to the internet.</p><p>The librarian grabbed the chair at the end of the table and turned it to face him. She sat down with her legs crossed, chin on her palm.</p><p>“Sir, as a librarian I am very curious how these books have the ability to save lives. I’m Vickie Steuber, by the way, branch manager.”</p><p>Sam spoke absently as he checked the index of each of the books.</p><p>“My partner and I are investigating the unusual incidents happening in town,” he said. “We believe something... unnatural is responsible.”</p><p>“Unnatural? As in supernatural?”</p><p>“Yes.” Sam flipped to pages referenced in the indexes, finding some spotty information, but enough to convince him he was on the right track.</p><p>“Interesting,” she said. “I’ve heard some admittedly strange stories about last night. Didn’t give them much credence.</p><p>“You should.”</p><p>“Are you saying it’s going to happen again?”</p><p>“Unless we figure out how to stop it,” Sam said. “Tonight will be worse.”</p><p>The librarian’s casually curious attitude evaporated. “How much worse?”</p><p>“Go home,” Sam said. “Lock your doors and windows until morning.”</p><p>“Oh...”</p><p>Sam tapped the keyboard of the nearest computer. A login screen appeared.</p><p>“How do I...?” he began.</p><p>“Login as guest,” she said. “Password is also guest. All lowercase.”</p><p>Sam logged in and opened a web browser to run a search. He selected blocks of text and sent them to the printer at the end of the table. Frowning, he closed the browser, stood up, and pulled out his cell phone to dial Dean.</p><p>When Dean picked up, he said, “I know what we’re up against. Pick me up at the library. Across the street from the Ledger.”</p><p>To afford Sam privacy while he made his call, Vickie Steuber had wandered toward the front of the library. Staring through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she crossed her arms and shuddered. Sam walked up beside her.</p><p>“It will be dark soon,” she said.</p><p>“Do you have a ride?”</p><p>“The ten-year-old white Corolla in the parking lot is mine,” she said. “Very reliable.”</p><p>“Good,” Sam said. “Remember what I said and you should be safe.”</p><p>“Even as a child,” she said, “I was never afraid of the dark.”</p><p>“Not too late to start.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Pausing at the passenger door of the Impala, Sam nodded to Vickie Steuber as she pulled out of the library lot in her Corolla. Judging by her pale face and wide eyes, Sam was confident she’d make a beeline for home. Other than leaving town, the next safest option for her should be inside her own home. Although that hadn’t helped Max Barnes.</p><p>“Find something in the Ledger ‘s morgue?” Dean asked.</p><p>“More like what I didn’t find,” Sam said. “Brief coverage of Teddy’s accident a year ago. Nothing since. But the garment factory fire is still the subject of stories six months later. In Olga’s eyes, everyone has forgotten about her grandson.”</p><p>“So patient zero is a suspect again.”</p><p>“Not intentionally,” Sam said. “Not consciously. It’s more complicated than that. I think she... called it. Subconsciously. In her own nightmares.”</p><p>“Called what?”</p><p>“Nocnitsa,” Sam said. “The night hag in Polish mythology. A nightmare spirit. It’s known for tormenting children.”</p><p>“Like the Barnes kid.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Dean, it drains life energy. Looking at pictures of Olga from a year ago compared to how she looks now. Like the thing has aged her twenty-five years.”</p><p>“So it’s feeding off her and creating these living nightmares.”</p><p>“Who knows? Maybe Eve used something like nocnitsa to generate some of the monsters that hunters have been killing for hundreds, maybe thousands of years.”</p><p>“A mobile monster factory.”</p><p>“And it feeds off of emotional darkness,” Sam said. “Depression and sadness make it stronger, more powerful.”</p><p>“This town must be like a friggin’ smorgasbord.”</p><p>“A vicious circle,” Sam said. “More death and destruction, more negative emotions to feed it.”</p><p>“Perfect storm,” Dean said, nodding. “How do we recognize it?”</p><p>“It’s made of shadows, with glowing red eyes.”</p><p>“Shadows? How do we gank it?”</p><p>“Supposedly not fond of iron.”</p><p>“So we attack random shadows with iron? Hope for the best?”</p><p>“Sorry, Dean,” Sam said. “That’s all I could find in the library and online. Soon as I figured out the nocnitsa was involved, I called Bobby again. He’d already locked onto the night hag as a possibility but has no new information. Promised he’d keep looking.”</p><p>“Dude, it’s almost evening. We’re running short on time here.”</p><p>“While we’re waiting, I know where we can get our hands on some iron.”</p><p>The shadows stretched long and had begun to fade as Dean hacksawed another wrought-iron post from the collapsed fence around the hulking remains of the Clayton Falls Apparel Company. Once the posts were freed from the panel, they cut them in half, about the length of a sawed-off shotgun. Since the posts had ornamental points that resembled spearheads, they made serviceable stabbing weapons.</p><p>“This site is responsible for most of the negative emotions feeding the nocnitsa,” Sam said. “These fence posts might turn that negative energy against it.”</p><p>Dean hefted one of the posts, practiced thrusting it forward with one hand and then both hands.</p><p>“Olga called this thing in her sleep?” he asked.</p><p>“Maybe that’s the only way somebody can call it,” Sam said. “It speaks nightmares. Olga has bottled-up rage, an unspoken desire for revenge, and sees only injustice where her grandson’s friends are concerned. Subconsciously, I think she... vented. She wanted them punished. She’s read all those books on the history and folklore of Poland, probably multiple times.”</p><p>“So subconsciously, she hired a monster hit man—hit woman? This night hag?”</p><p>They returned to the Impala, each holding a pointed halfpost.</p><p>“Maybe that’s how it works,” Sam said. “That’s its currency. You feed it, and it does the dirty work.”</p><p>“Came for the cake, stayed for the negative emotion party.”</p><p>“She’s a stubborn old woman,” Sam said. “But on a conscious level, she has no idea what’s happening. She’s sickly and blames aging. Bitter but blames karma for what happened to Bullinger and Lacosta.”</p><p>Dean tossed the hacksaw in the trunk of the Impala, slammed the lid shut.</p><p>Sam’s cell phone rang.</p><p>“Bobby,” Sam said after checking the display. He put the call on speaker and walked toward Dean. “Bobby, you find anything?”</p><p>“Lore’s a little light on this one, boys.”</p><p>Dean frowned. “You called to tell us you got nothing?”</p><p>“No, ya idjit,” Bobby said. “Of course I got something.”</p><p>“Let’s hear it,” Sam said.</p><p>“Everything I found says this nocnitsa is made of shadows...”</p><p>Dean mouthed the word “nothing” and Sam shook him off.</p><p>“But I found a pattern,” Bobby said. “If two cases make a pattern.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Both times a hunter went up against a nocnitsa, the thing was feeding.”</p><p>“She takes solid form to feed?”</p><p>“Best guess,” Bobby said. “And she only feeds when her victim is sleeping.”</p><p>“We gotta gank her red-handed?” Dean said.</p><p>“Job was easy, boy, everybody’d do it.”</p><p>“Doubt that, Bobby,” Dean said.</p><p>“Quit yer bitchin’ and listen.”</p><p>“You got more?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What I gather, if you don’t end this thing, the nightmare manifestations will outlast the nightmares that spawned them, take on a life of their own. Phrase ‘eternal night’ keeps popping up. And not like it’s a good thing.”</p><p>“How much longer before that happens?”</p><p>“Rate this thing is powering up? Better kill her tonight or there won’t be a town left to save.”</p><p>With Dean driving east along Welker, Sam said, “Our best chance—maybe our only chance—at catching this thing feeding is at Olga Kucharski’s house.”</p><p>“Why there?”</p><p>“She starts there,” Sam said. “Hasn’t finished her original mission.”</p><p>“Lucy Quinn.”</p><p>“Last one left,” Sam said. “After that, the night hag could go anywhere.”</p><p>“We can’t kill it unless it’s feeding,” Dean said. “By the time that happens, the Charger will be back, gunning for Lucy.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “She’ll be a sitting duck.”</p><p>“We split up,” Dean said. “I bodyguard Lucy, you wait at Olga’s for feeding time.”</p><p>Dean dropped Sam off near the Kucharski residence and then drove to C.J.’s Diner to keep an eye on Lucy Quinn. When he’d left to pick up Sam at the library, Sophie Bessette left as well. Dean had advised her to go home, but she flashed a mysterious smile and gave him a little wave goodbye without revealing her intentions. Lucy, however, hadn’t finished her shift and had promised to hang around until Dean gave the all-clear.</p><p>He pulled into the diner’s crowded parking lot and hurried inside. Betsy had taken over Lucy’s section and navigated the booths and tables with practiced fluidity. A buzz of excited conversation filled the air and Dean heard the word “nightmare” several times as neighbors and acquaintances compared notes. Dean intercepted Betsy when she returned to the counter to pick up an order.</p><p>“Lucy in the break room?”</p><p>“She was,” Betsy said. “Got fidgety. Went outside for some fresh air.”</p><p>“Crap,” Dean said under his breath. He hadn’t seen anyone outside when he parked the Impala. “If she comes back, tell her to wait here.”</p><p>“Sure thing, Agent DeYoung,” Betsy said and slipped past him, balancing a large round metal tray filled with several entrees.</p><p>Dusk had transitioned quietly, dangerously, into evening.</p><p>When Dean stepped outside, the streetlights were on and all the passing cars had turned on their headlights. He walked a circuit around the diner to no avail. At any minute, anywhere in town, lethal nightmares could be forming. One of the first ones would be a ‘68 Dodge Charger lining up Lucy Quinn in its high beams. And she was nowhere to be found.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam couldn’t take the chance that Olga Kucharski would let him wait in the house while she turned in for the night. She was sick, feeble, and slept fitfully at odd hours. Now that night had fallen, the chances of her falling asleep had increased. And the night hag would be ready. Even if the old woman were amenable, the thought of having a stranger in her home might prevent her from falling asleep. And if she stayed awake, would the nocnitsa wait around? Or move on to another, random, house to feed off a different dreamer? A stealthy approach provided his best chance at catching the night hag feeding. With that in mind he’d brought along a set of lock picks.</p><p>Checking the street for pedestrian traffic, Sam slipped along the side of the house and peered through a livingroom window. A gap in the blinds revealed a glimpse of Olga Kucharski in her recliner, the TV remote control dangling from her hand at the end of the armrest. The television was on with the sound turned too low to hear through the closed window. Another peek revealed that Olga’s eyes were closed. The lamp on the table beside her chair began to flicker. Sam worried the stuttering light would rouse her, but she seemed too tired to react to the shifting shadows. As he watched, a deeper shadow slid down the wall, a shadow whose impenetrable darkness defied the arc of light that intermittently flashed across it. A moment later, the lamp winked off and the ambient light cast from the television set vanished. The room plunged into darkness. At the same moment, the streetlight in front of the house seemed to burn out.</p><p>Sam crept back to the front door, knelt in front of the lock and placed his wrought-iron short-spear on the welcome mat, freeing his hands. First he tucked a thin Maglite between his chin and shoulder to illuminate the lock, but the flashlight immediately dimmed until it provided no light. The night hag, he guessed, it’s knocked out all electric light. He’d have to work the lock by feel alone.</p><p>Inserting the tension bar in the lock, he applied torque to the cylinder while working the pick to set the pins. He’d had years of practice picking locks. The skill relied on touch and hearing more than sight anyway. In a few seconds, the pins were set and he slowly turned the cylinder, releasing the deadbolt and unlocking the door.</p><p>After tucking his lock-pick set in his jacket, he scooped up the short-spear and eased the door inward. If he’d timed it well, Olga was sleeping and the nocnitsa was feeding. But that meant that the phantom Charger would be hunting Lucy.</p><p>After pacing in the diner’s break room, Lucy Quinn had walked around the parking lot waiting for DeYoung, the shorter FBI agent, to show up. Unable to sit still for more than a couple of minutes, she thought a brisk walk would burn off her nervous energy. But she had walked farther than she intended. As dusk slid into nightfall, she looked up and saw C.J.’s several blocks distant.</p><p>Her first thought was to call Agent DeYoung and tell him she’d be there in a couple of minutes, but her cell phone signal strength kept dropping from three bars to none, and each time the display flashed the “no signal” icon, the call disconnected. As she hurried back toward the diner’s neon sign, white mist swirled around her shoes, immediately reminding her of the headless horseman in Founders Park and the—</p><p>Behind her a car motor revved.</p><p>Headlights flipped on, casting her shadow forward.</p><p>She looked over her shoulder and recognized the muscle car rumbling in the middle of the road. The car had inhabited her dreams and nightmares for the past year. And she’d watched helplessly as it crushed her friend against his house.</p><p>Stunned, she stared at it now and imagined the cherry-red paint had transformed into blood. From what she could tell in the relative darkness, with the headlights glaring at her, the damage Tony’s father had inflicted on the Charger was gone, as if the car reset itself each time it appeared. And that made as much sense as the wrecked car returning from the junkyard in pristine condition.</p><p>The Charger inched forward. The tires angled toward the sidewalk. Like a predator ready to pounce on overmatched prey.</p><p>Keeping her head turned over her shoulder, Lucy began to jog away from the car on a course leading her toward the diner. She should have stayed in the break room and not let anxiety drive her into the night.</p><p>Suddenly, the car’s tires squealed and the Charger lurched forward with a full-throated roar of its engine. With a shower of sparks, the car jumped the curb and veered toward her.</p><p>Lucy sprinted across the street and ducked behind a parked blue Ford Fiesta. But her logic was flawed. Treating the car as if it were directed by a human driver who needed to see her to hit her made no sense. The Charger had appeared out of thin air behind her. It couldn’t see her. Didn’t need to see her. It knew where she was.</p><p>The engine roared again becoming unbearably loud.</p><p>Almost too late, she realized what was about to happen.</p><p>Rising from her crouch, she ran alongside the Fiesta a split second before the Charger rammed into the opposite side of it, shoving the smaller car onto the sidewalk as if it had been struck by a jet-powered bulldozer.</p><p>Reversing, the Charger spun out into the middle of the street, its grill crushed, both headlights shattered. Shifting into drive again, the Charger raced toward her, angling again for the curb. Lucy screamed and sprinted toward the diner, knowing she was too far away to make it before the Charger struck again.</p><p>A shadow darted past her, bright light bobbing at his side.</p><p>Agent DeYoung! she realized.</p><p>He heaved his arm forward, throwing something in a blur of golden, flickering light. Glass shattered against the windshield of the Charger, followed by a whoosh of sound, and the hood of the car was suddenly awash in flame.</p><p>DeYoung spun around, caught her hand and tugged her so hard she almost fell. But she caught her balance and together they raced toward the diner.</p><p>“What was that?” she breathed.</p><p>“Molotov cocktail,” he replied. “When I couldn’t find you, thought I should have something prepared.”</p><p>“Won’t help,” she said panting.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“No driver,” she said. “Doesn’t need to see.”</p><p>He looked back and she followed his gaze.</p><p>The Charger was burning but continued its relentless pursuit. It veered toward the curb and the tires on the right side lurched over it. Lucy heard a crumpled wheel well rubbing against one of the front tires. Damage sustained from the powerful collision slowed the car’s acceleration, buying them a few extra seconds.</p><p>But the Charger was gaining fast.</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam closed the door softly behind him.</p><p>While feeding off the life energy of Olga Kucharski and generating living nightmares in town, the nocnitsa might not notice his approach, but that was no excuse for carelessness. He might have one chance to kill the night hag. Once it left Olga’s house, it could go anywhere and elude Dean and him until dawn, growing more powerful with each passing hour.</p><p>Pressed against the wall, he eased forward, the living room through the entranceway on his left. Olga sat on the opposite side of the wall, feeding the monster that was exacting the old woman’s revenge, while terrorizing the entire town. Raising his wrought-iron short-spear in a double overhand grip, Sam stepped away from the wall. Though he stood in relative darkness, he remembered the layout of the room, imagined the exact position of the ratty recliner, picturing the table and lamp beside it, the ivory-colored antimacassar on the headrest.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he rushed through the entranceway and struck out with the short-spear, aiming the tip about a foot above the headrest. He overbalanced when the spear tip whistled through the air and took a divot out of the drywall.</p><p>Other than the ambient light coming through the edges of the blinds, the only illumination in the living room came from the glowing red eyes of the nocnitsa, from where the monster perched on the left armrest of the recliner, staring at him.</p><p>“Too late, hunter,” the nocnitsa rasped, like wind given voice.</p><p>The monster’s body was a deeper black than the darkness she inhabited, presenting a sinuous, three-dimensional silhouette Sam could track, her torso and limbs little more than muscle stretched over a narrow skeleton, with overly long fingers and toes. Though she had stopped feeding, she remained solid, at least for the moment.</p><p>“Feeding off a harmless old woman,” Sam said, subtly altering his stance to allow for a second quick strike with the iron rod. “Not impressed.”</p><p>“The choice was hers,” the night hag said. As she talked, she moved her hands, fingers hypnotically curling and uncurling like a magician preparing for a demonstration of sleight of hand. “She wanted revenge, prayed for it, dreamt about it. That’s why I was drawn to her. And what a feast of fearful images she provided!” A long sigh of pleasure escaped the nocnitsa’s elongated maw. “But she’s dead now.”</p><p>As if to punctuate those words, the TV remote control slipped from Olga Kucharski’s fingers and struck the floor. The twin burning embers of the nocnitsa’s eyes seemed to track the downward movement.</p><p>Sam lunged forward, roaring as he swept the point of the wrought-iron short-spear through the night hag’s torso. With a sharp hiss, the monster rose toward the ceiling, dissolving into loose shadows like dissipating coils of black smoke. For a moment, Sam thought he’d pierced its solid form, but the monster’s head and glowing eyes drifted away from him and it spoke once more.</p><p>“I will gorge on this town’s darkness. I will feed until no one is left. And there is nothing you or any hunter can do to stop me.”</p><p>Sam darted around the recliner and swung the short-spear over his head, as if striking a piñata, aiming for the spot between the two glowing red eyes, the last solid remnant of the night hag’s body. A desperation move. One he didn’t expect to succeed and in that he wasn’t surprised.</p><p>The burning eyes faded away before the wrought-iron got close.</p><p>Sam stumbled forward but caught himself before he crashed into the street-facing window. He turned around as the table lamp and the television came back on. Despite expecting the worst, he was startled by what he saw.</p><p>Olga Kucharski’s body had been reduced to a desiccated husk with papery, liver-spotted skin stretched taut over her arthritic bones, her head little more than a skull with wisps of gray hair clinging to the sides. Sam feared that if he touched her, she would crumble to dust.</p><p>He reached into his jacket for his cell phone.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean was running for his life.</p><p>Technically he was running for Lucy Quinn’s life, but he had his hand wrapped around hers and if the Charger caught them, it would run them both down. When his Impala had been possessed, it hadn’t ended well. Dean was determined to avoid a similar outcome. He looked up and smiled.</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>“What?” Lucy said.</p><p>“Get behind that monster,” Dean said. “But not too close—and watch out.”</p><p>Gleaming under a streetlight, a parked mustard-yellow Hummer H2 awaited them.</p><p>Lucy ran alongside the formidable SUV and ducked behind it. Dean leapt onto the hood, scrambling up onto the roof, dropping flat as he grabbed the luggage rack and spun himself around to face forward. He whipped out his automatic and fired several shots at the onrushing Charger. The second shot blew out the front passenger tire and the fifth ruptured the driver’s side tire.</p><p>The Charger’s windshield wipers continued to burn, but the flames on the white-striped hood and the windshield itself had burned themselves out. Fortunately, some of the gasoline from the Molotov cocktail had leaked through the gaps in the crumpled hood and smoke billowed out from both sides. The engine was burning.</p><p>The racing car chewed through its damaged wheels and surged forward on the rims, striking sparks from the asphalt. Dean braced for impact.</p><p>The Charger slammed into the frame-mounted bumper of the Hummer, rocking the much larger car backward but not by much. Nevertheless, the impact hurled Dean forward, wrenching his arm in its socket as he tumbled onto the Hummer’s windshield. His grip held and he stared down at the Charger as it reversed a short distance then rammed the Hummer a second time. Flames were spreading under the muscle car and Dean had a bad feeling about the next few seconds.</p><p>Pulling himself back to the roof of the Hummer, he raced toward the rear of the SUV and leapt into the darkness, spotting Lucy crouched below as he sailed over her.</p><p>He hit the ground on his shoulder and rolled with the impact.</p><p>Behind him a concussive roar presaged a blast of openfurnace heat that washed over him as a fireball spread outward and lit the night sky. Metal debris rained down around him, rattling across the road, trailing smoke and—</p><p>—vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The fiery light winked out and with it the heat was abruptly gone.</p><p>Dean’s cell phone rang.</p><p>Brushing himself off, Dean stood and massaged his sore neck with his free hand as he answered the call. “Sam?”</p><p>“Olga’s dead,” Sam said, his voice dejected.</p><p>“The nocnitsa? Tell me you got it.”</p><p>“Wish I could.”</p><p>“Son of a bitch,” Dean said. “What now?”</p><p>“Dean, she’s going to kill them all.”</p><p>“Be there in five minutes,” Dean said. “We need a plan.”</p><p>As Dean and Lucy hurried back to the diner, thunder rumbled ominously and rain began to fall. Dean glanced upward as lightning speared the night sky, leaving stark afterimages on his retinas.</p><p>The storm was coming.</p><p>As was his custom, Lou Santulli stayed after hours to file paperwork at Santulli Auto Sales, his used car dealership. When he was done, he walked through the place in the dim lighting and checked the desks of his salesman and receptionist, making sure they hadn’t left a mess for the morning. Anything to keep himself busy. The longer he stayed at work, the less time he had to listen to his wife’s grousing and her never-ending honey-do list. After hours, the dealership was a calm oasis for him to unwind.</p><p>Before heading home, he’d play online poker for an hour or two, mostly losing but he kept the losses manageable. The poker was another excuse to stay away from home. Hadn’t always been that way, but business had been slow the last couple of years as the economy tanked. When it came to cars, people wanted to squeeze blood from a stone. More of them accepted used car purchases but his margins kept getting shaved by the new frugality. But God forbid the Santullis had to tighten their belt. And yet that’s what it had come to and he had to listen to the complaining as if it was on a tape loop.</p><p>As he lost another hand of Texas Hold ‘em, his third in a row, the intensity of the rain pounding the roof caught his attention. Second night in a row with bad storms. Torrential downpours and flash flooding made for a lousy commute. He read that power lines had been downed by the previous night’s storm, not too far from his home but, fortunately, not affecting the Santulli household or she would have had one more damn thing to complain about.</p><p>With a heavy sigh, he ran his palm over his balding pate and leaned back in his leather desk chair. He ended his gambling session and shut down his computer. If the dealership lost power or was hit by a power spike, the machines could suffer damage and the thought of replacing a bunch of computers set his ulcer percolating. He walked through the dim interior of the building and shook off the screensavers so he could power off each workstation. As extra precaution, he pulled the plugs from the outlets.</p><p>The wind roared outside the broad plate-glass windows, rain lashing against them almost horizontally. He walked to the locked door and looked out at the car lot. The multicolored pennant flags that outlined the perimeter near the top of the streetlights whipped crazily for a few seconds before the line snapped. Somebody’s screen door cartwheeled down the street before sailing off into the night. The floor seemed to vibrate beneath him. A wooden fence slat slammed into the window next to him causing him to jump backward, heart pounding.</p><p>Across the street, he saw the funnel shape forming, behind the squat white wooden building with “Jake’s Snack Shop” painted on the front wall. Lou often ran over to Jake’s for a quick lunch, a burger or hot dog, and some fries, when he couldn’t afford time away from his own business. Now, he watched in horror as the funnel cloud barreled through the center of the building, ripping it to shreds, as if it had been stuffed into the bottom of a massive blender. Wooden debris blasted away in all directions.</p><p>Lou stood mesmerized as the tornado swirled and pounded its way through the restaurant on a collision course with his parking lot. The funnel cloud expanded, so wide he could no longer see the telltale shape without looking up and then that was insufficient as it bore down on him. Belatedly, he realized he should seek cover. His business was housed in a split-level building, with the offices in back, up a few steps. No basement in which to seek shelter. His best bet was an interior office or closet with no windows.</p><p>The roar became so loud he couldn’t think straight.</p><p>As he watched in horror, the white-striped blue Mini Cooper at the corner of the lot lifted upward and flipped back toward the front windows. He ducked a second before it crashed through the plate-glass window and demolished a desk.</p><p>If he thought the roar of the tornado was loud before, nothing prepared him for the terrific noise that assailed his ears. The swirling winds reached into the building and whipped papers and mugs and desk planners into the maelstrom.</p><p>He backed away, his jaw dropping as a red Mustang blew past the window, its bumper scraping along the asphalt before it rammed a silver Kia Sportage. One after another, the cars on his lot flipped over, rolled past, or soared overhead. Fierce winds buffeted him through the gap in the window and almost swept him off his feet several times.</p><p>He clenched his jaw so tight his teeth began to ache.</p><p>When a black Toyota Corolla rolled through the broken window and smashed into the Mini Cooper, Lou scrambled backward, feeling his body become buoyant in the air, as if he had no more substance than a paper bag. In seconds the tornado would sweep him up into the vortex and hurl him into the night. He clawed his way along the wall, crawled up the steps to the upper level and pried open the door to the storage closet in the middle of the building. He squeezed into the small room and the door slammed shut behind him so hard it rattled against its hinges.</p><p>Squatting on the floor, hands wrapped around his knees, Lou Santulli prayed softly, almost incoherently, a rambling jumble of sibilant words. If only he’d skipped the online poker and driven home at the start of the storm. If only he’d waited until morning to tidy the office...</p><p>More thunderous crashes and jarring bangs shook the walls of the building. The light in the closet winked out, plunging him in darkness. The roaring filled his ears, became his world. As the walls around him creaked and groaned, he fumbled in his pocket for his cell phone, to call his wife, to apologize for avoiding her, to tell her he still loved her, despite all the pointless bickering.</p><p>The phone display seemed unnaturally bright in the closet, revealing the shelves of notepads, folders and cleaning supplies—and the blood dripping from his forehead. He must have been struck by debris and, in his panic, hadn’t even noticed. Unfortunately, the cell phone had no signal. He held down the speed dial key for home to no effect, pressed disconnect, speed-dialed again, pressed disconnect, speed-dialed...</p><p>Something massive burst through the closet wall.</p><p>Before his brain could register what the object was, it struck the front of his head with the force of a sledgehammer, pulping his eyes, smashing the bone and cartilage of his nose into his brain and crushing his skull—</p><p>In the second or two before his cell phone shattered against an exposed two-by-four, a woman’s voice spoke through its tiny speaker, “Hello? Lou...?”</p><p>Roman Messerly woke up with someone shaking his shoulder.</p><p>“Dude, wake up!”</p><p>“What...?”</p><p>“You gotta go to work, man!”</p><p>Roman sat up and looked around the basement room. He was sprawled on a sofa facing a wide flat-screen TV. A game controller fell from his lap and clunked on the floor. Took him a few seconds to remember he’d stopped at his friend’s house to pass some time before his shift. In Gavin’s man cave.</p><p>“Gavin, weren’t we...?”</p><p>“Dude, you fell asleep in the middle of Halo,” Gavin said. “Ever hear of an energy drink? What’s up with you? Forget your multivitamins? You look like shit, man.”</p><p>“Trouble sleeping lately.”</p><p>“I left for a Coke, but we lost power down here, so I figured I’d let you sleep until you had to leave—which is now, dude.”</p><p>“Thanks, man, don’t want to be late.”</p><p>Roman pushed himself up from the sofa. Lately, he’d been wiped out. Kept thinking he was on the verge of a nasty virus, but so far exhaustion was his only symptom. As he lumbered up the stairs and through the front door, he fought another jaw-cracking yawn and ran into a torrential downpour.</p><p>His old black-and-tan Subaru Outback seemed a mile away. By the time he ran to the curb and fumbled his key into the lock, he was thoroughly soaked. As he started the engine, water dripping off his face and hands, he thought about putting in for a week’s vacation. He’d sleep for five of the seven days. Make that six. He’d save the seventh for a day trip somewhere.</p><p>Pulling away from the curb, he felt a wave of exhaustion wash over him and he became hypnotized by the fierce metronome of the windshield wipers on their highest setting. For a moment, he thought his vision had dimmed, but darkness had come inside the car and swelled around him. The dashboard lights faded away and a raspy woman’s voice seemed to whisper in his ear.</p><p>“Not done with you yet.”</p><p>When the engine died and the Outback’s momentum carried it down the side of the road, along a grassy embankment, Roman was already unconscious, his breathing labored.</p><p>“That’s a freakin’ tornado,” Dean said moments after Sam climbed into the Impala, dripping wet.</p><p>Biting her nails nervously, Lucy Quinn leaned forward from the backseat.</p><p>“This is totally crazy,” she whispered.</p><p>“Crazy’s coming,” Dean said. “But it hasn’t reached the station yet.”</p><p>“I had it, Dean,” Sam said, furious with himself. “Close enough to hurt it. Just not bad enough.”</p><p>“We’ll gank it, Sam,” Dean said with more confidence than he felt.</p><p>Through the frenetic slashing arc of the wipers clearing the windshield in split-second intervals, they watched the massive funnel cloud—a wedge of darkness against the evening sky—churn its way across the western edge of town.</p><p>Dean drove west along Welker, proceeding with caution because he had no plan once he reached the tornado. Like catching a tiger by the tail. As if to confirm the foolhardy nature of his direction of travel, every other car on the road was racing in the opposite direction. They were a mile away from the tornado when it ripped the roof off a house and flung it into the night like a kite with a severed string.</p><p>“Plus side,” Dean said grimly, “don’t see any flying cows.”</p><p>When they were within a half-mile, the funnel cloud swept across the parking lot of a gas station, veering toward the pumps. One of the supports holding a canopy over the gas station lot buckled and the roof toppled over, metal screeching and scraping along the asphalt, trailing sparks.</p><p>Two blocks away, Dean jammed the brake pedal, skidding to a stop on the slick road.</p><p>The explosion blossomed in front of them and the concussive blast rocked the Impala’s suspension. Bits of glass and flaming metal debris pelted the ground around them. A charred piece of a gas pump housing plunked the hood of the Impala and ricocheted across two lanes of traffic before slamming into a curb.</p><p>“Dean, it’s gone,” Sam said.</p><p>At first, Dean thought his brother was referring to the gas station explosion which, unlike the exploding phantom Charger, had definitely not vanished. Flames continued to burn, smoke continued to billow into the night, and wreckage continued to clink and clatter around them. The gas station was real, not a living nightmare. Its destruction was a reality. But then, Dean noticed the absence of the fierce wind that had buffeted the Impala as they had approached the tornado. Looking left and right, and then leaning out the window for a better view, he confirmed that the twister was gone.</p><p>“Small favors,” he mumbled.</p><p>Dean made a looping turn on the empty road and headed east, back toward C.J.’s Diner, but they had traveled less than a mile when the Impala trembled slightly. A moment later, it rocked to the right and shimmied. Thinking the car had taken some damage, Dean pulled to the side of the road for a quick inspection.</p><p>The moment he stepped out of the car, the ground trembled. Along the street, parked cars began to wail as their theft alarms were triggered. Windows in a nearby building cracked and shattered. In the spread of the Impala’s headlights on the asphalt, Dean saw cracks forming.</p><p>“Great, tornadoes and now an earthquake,” he muttered</p><p>He jumped back in the car, shifted into drive and sped toward the diner.</p><p>“Dean! Look out!” Sam yelled.</p><p>He saw it in time, a fissure opening diagonally across Welker Street, spreading wide enough to accommodate a car tire and break an axle. He swerved away from the worst of it, but felt the Impala lurch over a gap when he gunned the engine.</p><p>A Colorado State Patrol cruiser coming from the opposite direction wasn’t as fortunate. As the fissure continued to widen, the front wheels of the speeding cruiser dropped into the gap and the front bumper smashed into the opposite edge. The vehicle tilted forward, slipping into the abyss. The doors of the cruiser swung open and two uniformed troopers jumped out and scrambled away from the car a second before it lurched down into the crack. Only the trunk remained above ground.</p><p>Dean slowed, waiting to see if the men needed help, but another State Patrol cruiser, which had been following the first, managed to stop before plowing into the lead car. The two stranded troopers scurried back to the second car and climbed into the back.</p><p>At the end of Roman Messerly’s life, when he had no more left to give her, a spasm wracked his body so violently his collarbone shattered. When the nocnitsa released her grip on his forehead, the husk of his body fell forward, dangling against the support of the shoulder strap. He had worried about potential tragedies and emergencies his whole life, despite actions and training he’d taken to prepare himself to face them. He’d never have to worry about them again, but she’d made his fears a reality and, in his own way, Roman had left his mark on the town.</p><p>The nocnitsa shed her substance and spiraled up into the night air, potent with energy she’d culled from her first victims. With her glowing red eyes she gazed upon the town and the spreading chaos and roared with pleasure, a sound like shrill wind whistling through confined spaces. She could feel the town as a whole, from edge to edge, a busy little hive of fear and uncertainty, doubt and grief. For a few moments, before flying down to her next victim, she rippled outward, a flash of darkness that would infect every mind within miles. Those awake would feel a cold chill race up their spine and experience an unexplained feeling of dread, while those asleep... ah, those asleep spoke her natural language, and she spoke to them, deep in their minds, summoning the deepest darkness to the place where it could live...</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Kurt Machalek had collected hearts in mason jars because hearts were totems. They imparted mystical powers to the one who claimed them. But for that power to pass to him, he’d had to seize them from living sacrifices. His socalled victims never understood their higher purpose in his apotheosis, so he explained it to them in detail before carving the still-beating organ from their chests. To become invulnerable and immortal, he’d needed to collect a dozen hearts. Unfortunately, the FBI caught him after his seventh acquisition and took the hearts from him. Unenlightened, they didn’t understand. As a result, when he escaped from his solitary cell, he would have to begin his collection all over again. He’d lost his accumulated mystical powers when they captured him and removed his totems. Locked away in his cell in the supermax wing of Falls Federal, he slept and dreamed of the day when he could restore his mystical energies. Once he got his dozen, he would show them true power.</p><p>In his dreams he saw his victims again, every one of them, and he would smile at the fond memories of those early acquisitions. They would scream as the power left their bodies, propelled into their hearts for him to capture. By the time they were still, their power was his to wield and it electrified him with his growing potential.</p><p>While he would have preferred to dream and fantasize about future sacrifices to his glorification, he had no control over his subconscious. Not that it mattered. Reliving his socalled crimes was a pleasurable experience, a brief mental vacation. He never had nightmares because he feared nobody and nothing...</p><p>But suddenly, his dream became troubling. He’d been toiling over his fourth victim—a young soccer mom who begged him to let her go, saying she wouldn’t tell if he just let her go—when he noticed people standing around him in a circle. That was wrong. Each sacrifice demanded his complete focus to channel the heart energy at the moment of death. He never allowed witnesses to his sacred rite. But for some reason, while he could sense people closing around him in a tightening circle, he couldn’t see them. He plunged the bowie knife into the soccer mom’s chest, delighting in the brief scream of primal power as he sliced his way to the pulsing heart and—</p><p>—woke up in his bunk in the dim lighting of his solitary cell.</p><p>But he was not alone. Others stood in his cell, in a semicircle around him, their clothes stained with dried blood, smeared and clumped with the dirt of their shallow graves. All except for the young soccer mom standing in the middle of the seven. Her torn blouse was wet with fresh blood, the gaping hole in her chest dripping crimson droplets onto the floor of his cell.</p><p>“No,” he said. “You can’t be here. None of you. I took your power.”</p><p>En masse, they stepped forward, their eyes wide with fury, teeth bared, spittle and flecks of blood on their chins. As one, they raised their arms, each holding a butcher knife.</p><p>“No! This isn’t right,” he said. “It’s personal and sacred!”</p><p>The soccer mom stabbed his thigh, the butcher knife sinking deep enough to scrape bone.</p><p>He roared in pain and shoved her back. She smiled a wicked little smile and spat in his face.</p><p>As if that was their cue, the other six surged forward, knives rising and falling, plunging into his flesh, slicing his arms and legs, sinking into the meat behind his collarbone, puncturing a lung. Though he was physically strong, they overwhelmed him. Every push and shove, every punch and kick, was met with the bite of steel ripping into his flesh. They swarmed over him, knocking him from his bunk.</p><p>He curled into a fetal position, arms over his face and head, but they aimed lower, cutting through his abdomen with single-minded ferocity. Then, one by one, they reached their grave-cold hands inside his body, and their clawing fingers ripped out his organs and crushed them in their fists.</p><p>They saved his heart for last.</p><p>In the break room of Taco Terrace, located at the southern edge of town, Mike Keoghan leaned his chair back against the wall, put his feet up on the table, crossed at the ankles, and shoved earbuds into his ears with the iPod’s volume turned up loud enough to drown out the usual commotion at the front of the fast-food restaurant. He was determined to get maximum value out of his fifteen-minute break. The previous night he’d been up until nearly dawn, talking on the phone with his girlfriend, who’d had a big fight with her parents about breaking curfew.</p><p>After a long day, he was tired, his feet ached and his eyes burned. He crossed his arms over his chest and closed his eyes, drifting into a nap while Johnny Cash sung about his “Ring of Fire.”</p><p>He dreamed of black smoke rising from a fire but when he looked for the flames, all he saw was the smoke, hanging overhead like poisoned clouds. Something was wrong about the black clouds, but the reason escaped him. Slowly, he became aware of someone tugging at his brown polyester Taco Terrace shirt.</p><p>“Couple more minutes,” he mumbled.</p><p>The tugging continued.</p><p>Irritably, he moved his arm to brush away the person’s hand but something wasn’t right. Instead of touching clothes or skin, he felt fur beneath his fingers. Rising to groggy consciousness, he experienced the tugging and pulling from both sides of his body. Something pushed at his chest and arms, even his legs. When he shoved against the weight on his left arm, he yelped, jerking his hand away. Something had bit him.</p><p>“What the hell—?”</p><p>Opening his eyes, he saw dozens of beady black eyes staring back at him. Rats—crawling all over his body. They waddled up his torso, pink noses twitching, sharp teeth flashing at him.</p><p>Yelling, he kicked convulsively, causing the tilted chair to slide down and drop him hard. The back of his head struck the linoleum floor and lights flashed in his skull.</p><p>In a moment, the rats swarmed over him.</p><p>Frantically, he looked to the left and right and saw hundreds of them flowing across the floor, a pulsing tide of grimy fur. He rolled onto hands and knees, crushing some rats beneath him, while dozens more bit his hands, neck and ears. As he lunged upright and staggered toward the door, they covered his body like a living fur coat, continually biting his exposed flesh. Three climbed up the back of his scalp while another ducked its head inside his mouth and, when he tried to scream, gnawed his tongue.</p><p>Furious, he bit its head off and spit it out like a bloody wad of chewing tobacco and slammed his body against the door. Several rats were dislodged from his clothing, but others scrambled up his sneakers and under the cuffs of his trousers, clawing his shins and biting the meaty back of his calves.</p><p>He fumbled with the doorknob while rats gnawed the back of his hand, tearing away his flesh, bit by bit. His own blood made the doorknob slippery but he finally managed to turn it and push his way through into the cooking area.</p><p>The customers lined up to order their meals saw him draped with hungry rats before his coworkers noticed. Uniformly, the customers screamed and ran for the exits. One teenaged girl held up her cell phone and recorded some video as she backed out of the restaurant. But when Mike had opened the door to the break room, all the rats that hadn’t climbed on him, rushed through the doorway into the restaurant’s seating area. The screams became shrieks and the people who hadn’t already left shoved each other aside and struggled through the doors. Some fell and were trampled by those behind them, then were attacked by the rats themselves.</p><p>Mike’s coworkers reacted seconds after the customers. Gail had just lifted a metal basket filled with fries out of the deep fryer. When she saw him, she screamed and hurled the basket at him. The hot grease dripping from the basket burned his face, but dislodged the two rats that had been chewing through his cheeks and another that had crossed over his ear to gnaw on his right eye.</p><p>“Help me!” Mike cried.</p><p>Jimmy, who ran on the high school track team, jumped over the counter, his legs swinging to the side and knocking over a condiment stand before landing on all fours in front of the soft drink refill station. Rats covered the floor like a living carpet and when Jimmy landed on them, they swarmed up his arms and legs.</p><p>Gail, who was naturally thin, backed away and tried to climb through the drive-through window. Snakelike, she wriggled her way through the narrow gap, but her hips got caught when she bumped the lever that worked the window. Hanging in space, half in and half out of the restaurant, she began to scream in terror.</p><p>Albert, the night manager, backed away from Mike, a look of incomprehensible horror on his face. He stumbled backward and reached out to catch himself, inadvertently pressing his palms on the hot grill. Yelping in pain, he lurched in the opposite direction. He grabbed the phone off the hook with his tender hands and dialed 911, all the while backing away from Mike and completely ignoring Gail’s helpless screams. His heel mushed a jumble of fries strewn on the floor and he slipped, cracking his forehead against the edge of the counter. By the time the 911 operator asked him to state the nature of his emergency, Albert was unconscious. As she repeated the question a second time, the rats swarming along the floor ignored the plentiful fries and chewed ravenously on Albert’s face.</p><p>Watching Albert accidentally burn his hands had given Mike an idea.</p><p>He slammed his fur-covered forearms on the grill and burned at least seven rats, enjoying their pitiful squeals as they sizzled against the hot metal. With his arms free, he stumbled past Albert and kicked running rats away from his feet. He squeezed one eyelid shut to ward off a rat nipping at the tender flesh there and managed to swat it away before it sank its fangs into his eyeball.</p><p>Gail was kicking her legs frantically while she screamed, even though the rats hadn’t worked their way up to the counter yet and none were attacking her. Catching her legs in his arms to still them, Mike twisted her hips and pushed her through the window. She fell awkwardly outside, with a yelp and a curse, but she had escaped. Since Gail never went anywhere without her cell phone, Mike prayed she would call for help—soon as she stopped freaking out.</p><p>He tried to call to her, but his voice came out as a gurgle. Two rats were ripping into his throat and blood had washed down the front of his uniform shirt. Too much blood. He felt lightheaded and his balance was iffy. Seeing the phone dangling from its cord, he staggered toward it and dropped to his knees. He cradled the receiver in his hands but his fingers were numb, useless. He leaned over and tried to call for help, but no words escaped his lips. Everything had become darker, as if the restaurant lights were dying, and the floor spun beneath him and then his cheek was pressed to the linoleum, sticky with warm blood.</p><p>Far away, too far to matter to him anymore, sirens wailed in the night.</p><p>Rat tails slithered along his neck. A cold nose poked into his bloody ear.</p><p>Darkness swept over him and he remembered the darkness in his dream of the poisoned clouds...</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>For the past two days, Bryn Gunning had felt a tickle in her throat, a sure sign she was coming down with a head cold or some kind of virus she had probably picked up from one of her fifth-grade students. During the school year, somebody was always sick and the viruses survived by tag team propagation, as she called it. Sometimes it seemed as if schools were just incubators for the evolution of the super flu that would one day create an extinction event for the human race. Or, maybe she was feeling sorry for herself at the thought of yet another illness wracking her body for the next three to six weeks.</p><p>She’d been getting plenty of rest and taking echinacea, zinc and mega-doses of vitamin C since the first sign of the cold, hoping to nip it in its viral bud, but that strategy always amounted to little more than hopeless optimism. At least, she reasoned, she’d go down swinging.</p><p>Thunderstorms jarred her from sleep and the uncomfortable dream she’d been having about difficulty swallowing. Tangled up in her bed sheets, she wrestled her way out of bed and stumbled toward the bathroom in her fuzzy bunny slippers. Without warning, she began coughing and couldn’t stop. It was a dry cough and soon she was wheezing, unable to catch her breath. Flicking on the bathroom light, she grabbed a cup and tried to fill it with tap water while her body was wracked with spasms.</p><p>She managed to get a mouthful into the cup and half of that into her mouth, then sprayed it across the mirror as another round of coughing doubled her over. Hacking, she had the sensation that something was caught in her throat— and it was trying to get out!</p><p>With trembling fingers she reached into her mouth and grabbed something hard and pulled. The size of a large button, it had thin, twitching legs. Disgusted, she flung it into the sink and it crawled around the basin—a cockroach. Backing away from the sink, she bumped against the door and wiped her saliva-sticky hands against her oversized nightshirt, panting. Then the panting degraded into more coughing.</p><p>She spat three more wiggling cockroaches out of her mouth.</p><p>Weeping and shaking in revulsion, she gagged as she imagined them swarming in her stomach and crawling up her throat. On hands and knees, she crossed to the toilet, flung up the lid and gripped the edge of the bowl a moment before the torrent of vomit surged up her esophagus. Clear fluid, streaked with blood and riddled with squirming cockroaches, centipedes and spiders spilled out of her and flowed down the side of the toilet bowl. Desperately, she reached for the handle to flush the chitinous mass down the drain, but many of the bugs scrambled up the porcelain and dropped to her tile flooring. They wriggled and twitched and scuttled toward her legs.</p><p>Screaming between coughing fits, she scrambled out of the bathroom in a frantic crabwalk, rolled over and ran toward her bedside telephone. She lifted the receiver and punched in 911. Her stomach rumbled alarmingly. The operator answered but when Bryn tried to explain what was happening, she could only cough and hack, and she spit up more bugs. Several landed moistly on her forearm and skittered toward the hand holding the phone, while others scrambled up her arm, under the loose sleeve of her nightshirt. Dropping the phone in disgust, she swatted at the bugs nestling in her armpit or crossing over the swell of her breasts.</p><p>At some point, she’d lost her fuzzy slippers and, as she backed away from the phone, bugs on the floor squished between her toes. She gasped for air and coughed again, hacking out a wiggling centipede before she ran from her bedroom in a blind panic and stumbled down the stairs, catching herself on the railing a moment before she would have plunged headfirst to the landing. In sparing herself from a nasty fall, she’d twisted her right wrist hard enough that she thought something had broken.</p><p>Cradling her throbbing wrist against her rumbling stomach, she flung open her front door and ran into the street, grateful that the stormy night had brought cleansing rain to wash away the live bugs crawling on her body and the bits of dead bugs tangled in her hair or clinging to her face, arms and legs.</p><p>She lived behind the school where she worked, in the eastern suburbs of Clayton Falls and had always loved that when the weather was pleasant she could walk to work. Now she ran toward the sprawling elementary school building as if it were a sanctuary for her.</p><p>By the time she realized she should have stayed close to home after placing the incoherent emergency call, her stomach was protruding painfully beneath her nightshirt. She pressed her hands to her abdomen and felt her flesh rippling under her fingers. With each painful step, she coughed up more blood with the bugs. No matter how many of them she expelled, more remained inside her and they were impatient to get out. From the sharp pains telegraphing from her abdomen, she knew they were eating their way out of her body.</p><p>She ran as far as the playground equipment before collapsing to her hands and knees. Sobbing, she couldn’t find the energy to rise again. Wood chips bit into her palms and bare knees. Gagging, she coughed up a wolf spider large enough to fill her palm. As it dropped to the ground she smashed it with her fist.</p><p>A stabbing pain took her breath away.</p><p>She flopped on her back and moaned in agony.</p><p>Clutching at the bottom of her nightshirt, she pulled it up to expose her engorged abdomen. As she watched, golf-ball-sized lumps moved under her bruised skin. She clamped her fingers against the shifting mass and her broken fingernails cut into her skin. Blood welled up and the rain washed it away. Then, through one of the cuts, something dark brown edged upward, with twitching antenna and tiny barbed legs. The submerged mass gravitated toward the breach, pushing, surging—</p><p>—and Bryn screamed as her flesh tore open and released hundreds, thousands of roaches, beetles, centipedes, crickets, and spiders. Blood gushed out of her ruptured stomach, running down her sides and soaking into the bed of wet wood chips. But the bugs clung to her. They swarmed over her skin, biting and burrowing back into the flesh they had so recently escaped.</p><p>Always tired because sleep was no longer restful for her, Carla Battie would nod off in unconventional locations. Often she fell asleep on the sofa or an easy chair at home, rather than in her own bed. On several occasions, while sitting in one of the rear pews at United Methodist, she’d dozed off during the long sermons. Two weeks in a row, the Clayton Falls librarian had to wake her up after she’d spent too much time debating which New York Times bestseller to check out. And once, unfortunately, she’d fallen asleep while sitting in bumper-to-bumper traffic on I-80.</p><p>Although she often awoke from these impromptu naps with a bloodcurdling scream before regaining her senses and her sense of decorum, her neighbors were nothing short of sympathetic. Because they knew her as one of the few survivors of the Clayton Falls Apparel Company fire. Her car insurance company, on the other hand, had been less understanding about the fender-bender that had jarred her back to consciousness on the interstate.</p><p>For a while, she took the prescribed sleeping pills so she could sleep at night—through the night—but the pills made it harder to awaken from the nightmares which then became even more terrifying. After a week or so, she set the pills aside.</p><p>Six months had passed since the factory fire but Carla continued to have vivid nightmares about the raging flames and suffocating smoke that had taken the lives of her coworkers, many of whom had become close friends. Long after her doctor removed the plaster cast from the ankle she broke after jumping from the second-story factory window to escape the blaze, the psychological wounds refused to heal. She’d tried counseling for a while, learned about survivor’s guilt and post-traumatic stress, but none of the rationalizations or medications stopped the nightmares.</p><p>Each night she relived those minutes of stark terror before she had managed to escape the inferno. She hadn’t worked on the factory floor. She’d been a bookkeeper, leveraging her associate’s degree in accounting to earn an income that impressed no one. With what she always described as dumb luck, she’d taken a break from her tedious bank reconciliations to restock her desk drawers when the fire overwhelmed the factory. In the second-floor supply room, clutching several rolls of adding-machine tape, a few pens and telephone message pads, she staggered when she heard—and felt— the gas explosion. At the time, she imagined a tractor-trailer had jumped the curb outside and plowed into one of the building’s walls—only later, after she escaped, did she learn the cause of the destruction.</p><p>Seconds after the explosion, the heat became unbearable. Scattered supplies forgotten at her feet, she edged out of the second-floor room into what felt like the heart of a furnace, sinuous flames flowing up every surface, charring wood, leaping from point to point, devouring the old factory with incredible alacrity. Soon the billowing black smoke became overwhelming. She heard the screams, but the burning bodies—her choking friends and coworkers—suffered and died beneath the turbulent shroud of impenetrable smoke.</p><p>Almost every night, Carla relived the fear and hopelessness of that moment, the certainty that she would die with the others. She always woke from the nightmare version of those events before she noticed the beacon of light at the end of the catwalk, before she sprinted to that recalcitrant window in its warped frame, before she smashed it open with her jacketed elbow, scrambled through while sustaining multiple lacerations and dropped to the cement courtyard below, grateful for the stabbing pain in her leg because it meant she was alive, that she had miraculously survived. The nightmare always ended on the high note of her fear, not on the glimmer of hope, as if she had never escaped...</p><p>Once again the fullness of the nightmare seared through her subconscious, striking the nerve-jangling chord of fear at the penultimate moment, rousing her in that familiar, heartstopping instant to stark consciousness, gasping for air. But strangely, she found herself in her own bed. For the briefest time, drenched with perspiration, she marveled that she had managed to reach her bed before passing out from chronic exhaustion. Despite the recurrence of the nightmare, she entertained the idea that she had made progress. Maybe she wouldn’t need to move from Clayton Falls to free herself from reliving the horror. She’d been saving her money to move away from town and its constant reminders, but... No, she would move, to the west coast maybe, start over, make new friends and—</p><p>She coughed.</p><p>The acrid tang of smoke filled her mouth.</p><p>Suddenly, her smoke alarms wailed.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>An orange glow flared down the hall as a coughing spasm wracked her body. She stumbled out of bed, doubled over as black smoke swirled around her, as if she were the center of a vortex. Dropping to her knees, she fought for breath, her tears etching soot-streaked tracks on her cheeks as she cast about frantically for an escape route. In seconds, the walls surrounding her were engulfed in flames and the suffocating layer of smoke bore down on her. Face down on the beige carpet, she watched in horror as tongues of flame detached from the burning walls and darted toward her.</p><p>When her nightgown ignited, she screamed—but only for a second. Another coughing spasm curled her into a fetal position, blotting out her vision. She swatted at the flames searing her legs until the palms of her hands were no more than raw, shrieking nerve endings. But before she blacked out, in the moments before pain trumped everything else, her earlier thought returned.</p><p>She had never really escaped the fire.</p><p>The nocnitsa reveled in the darkness her effort had created, but reaching so far beyond her unformed body had drained her energy. She floated through the night sky and drifted downward, slipping into a house, creeping toward her victim in her guise of shadows and found him ready for her influence. A small pulse of her power and he drifted into sleep, a ready conduit.</p><p>Ehrich Vogel made a call earlier in the day to see his doctor, but reached his answering service instead. Apparently Doc Bennett didn’t have weekend hours, so Ehrich had to wait until Monday. Unless it was an emergency, in which case the service directed him to the Critical Care facility. For a man like Vogel—who had survived two car crashes, a fall on his noggin from a two-story ledge while hanging shutters, and the cave-in at Croyden Creek, which had left him with one good hand—extreme exhaustion hardly qualified as an emergency.</p><p>He suspected his heart might not be pumping at maximum efficiency. Hell, he’d be surprised if the needle hovered in the seventy-percent range most of the time. Of course, it could be his lungs. Lung cancer was not out of the realm of possibility for a former miner, not by a long shot. But he was exhausted, not short of breath.</p><p>And though he was bone-tired, sleep was elusive during the worst of the thunderstorm. He’d turned on the local news and heard there’d been a tornado sighting at the western edge of town, but that crisis seemed to have passed. Listening to the rest of the world’s troubles didn’t seem like a remedy for sleeplessness, so he switched off the old television set and picked up a book about John Adams he’d been meaning to read for the past few weeks.</p><p>Five pages further into the legacy of the second president of the United States, his eyes gave out, his drooping eyelids finally closed and his head bowed forward in sleep.</p><p>A curtain of darkness slid down the surface of the wall and began to coalesce above him. The lamp on the table at his side flickered off and on several times before winking out. Glowing red eyes appeared in the new darkness and a dark hand with elongated fingers closed over the old man’s forehead.</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The storm had ended, but the night was far from over. They’d stopped at C.J.’s—a relatively safe place to drop off Lucy—for a breather, and a fresh round of coffee. Despite the deleterious effects of prolonged lack of sleep and too much caffeine, Dean and Sam couldn’t risk nodding off while the nocnitsa was alive. Their subconscious minds would be negative energy gold mines. Though Dean’s head throbbed in a slow drumbeat of pain and his vision lacked focus no matter where he looked, he ordered another large coffee. Appearing as ragged as Dean felt, Sam seconded the order.</p><p>Sipping from their steaming cups, Dean, Sam, and Lucy Quinn sat in a booth in the crowded diner thankful that the weather had calmed. Sam ended a call with Officer Jeffries.</p><p>“Earthquake activity stopped,” Sam said. “Not even an aftershock.”</p><p>“Night hag burned through another Happy Meal?” Dean said.</p><p>Sam glanced at Lucy. “They found a paramedic dead in his car, on the side of the road,” he said. “I’m sorry, Lucy. It was Roman Messerly.”</p><p>“Oh, no,” Lucy said, clamping a hand over her mouth. “Roman? A car accident?”</p><p>“No other car involved,” Sam said. “From the description, sounds like another... husk.”</p><p>Lucy slipped out of the booth and ran to the restroom.</p><p>“Before, she said he was always nervous about the job,” Dean said. “Nervous enough to have nightmares about emergencies and natural disasters?”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Another victim was found by teenagers on the grounds of the elementary school. Abdomen ripped open. From the inside.”</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>“Teacher. Her body was crawling with bugs.”</p><p>“Bugs went Alien chest-burster on her?”</p><p>“Looks like,” Sam said. “But, Dean, the bugs were still alive.”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t—? Oh, nightmare bugs. And they didn’t vanish when she died? So, it’s true. The night hag is getting more powerful.”</p><p>“Maybe the bugs were somebody else’s nightmare.”</p><p>“But they appeared inside this woman,” Dean said, shaking his head. “That’s too... personal.”</p><p>“Either way,” Sam said. “Can’t be good.”</p><p>“So what now? We don’t know where the night hag will feed. Drive around and wait for a nightmare to appear?”</p><p>Dean’s cell phone rang. The display read “J. Wieczorek.”</p><p>“Dr. Gruesome,” Dean said. “Good news, I hope.”</p><p>“Sorry, Agent DeYoung,” Wieczorek said. “I begged them to black out Wicked Wolf Weekend, but they thought it was some kind of passive aggressive strategy for a contract renegotiation. Threatened to quit, but they said they’d have a dozen people lined up to replace me before my taped shows ran out.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. “We could be looking at a rabid wolf pack tonight.”</p><p>“Yes—no—I mean, I don’t know. If that’s how this... thing works. I wanted to warn you,” Wieczorek said.</p><p>“Thanks, Doc.”</p><p>Dean was about to disconnect when Wieczorek continued.</p><p>“I’m here with my cousin, Millie,” he said. “We have pages and pages of incidents compiled from emergency calls. Maybe they can help.”</p><p>“We’re at C.J.’s Diner,” Dean said. “We’ll use this as a base of operation. If we’re gone when you get here, wait for us.”</p><p>Dean disconnected and told Sam that they would soon have their hands on a list of emergency calls since the nocnitsa incidents had begun.</p><p>“Not sure what good it is,” Dean said, taking a large gulp of coffee. “Guess it can’t hurt.”</p><p>“What can’t hurt?” Lucy asked as she rejoined them.</p><p>“Information overload.”</p><p>“Emergency call details,” Sam said.</p><p>Betsy, their server, smiled as she refilled their coffee cups and asked if they wanted anything else.</p><p>“Not right now, thanks,” Sam said.</p><p>“Give a holler,” she said. At last her smile faltered, revealing a layer of unease she’d been hiding from her customers. “I’m not really sure what’s happening. But I’m scared—frankly, we’re all scared. So we’re counting on you guys. Half the people in town will need a psychiatrist before the week is over.”</p><p>“We’ve been through worse,” Sam said in a clear attempt to reassure her. “We’ll do whatever it takes.”</p><p>Dean’s cell phone rang again as Betsy thanked them and walked away.</p><p>Not the best timing, but Dean was pleasantly surprised when he saw “S. Bessette” on the caller ID display.</p><p>“Good to hear from you, Sophie,” he said. “Before you ask, the crisis isn’t over.”</p><p>“I know,” she said, her voice tense. “It’s here.”</p><p>Dean sat up straighter. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s falling apart!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Everything! It’s all falling apart.”</p><p>“I’ll be right there. Wait—where do you live?”</p><p>He scribbled the address on a paper napkin.</p><p>Through the phone’s speaker, Dean heard a resounding crash in the background. Sophie shrieked.</p><p>“Sophie, hold tight. I’ll be there in a couple minutes,” he said and ended the call. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Lucy rose with him and Sam, but Dean put a hand on her shoulder. “Need you to stay here.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Doc Gruesome and his cousin are meeting us here,” Dean said, though his real reason was to keep the young woman out of harm’s way. “Tell them to sit tight until we get back.”</p><p>Dean crossed Main Street and turned left on Bell, swerving between cars as he raced to Sophie Bessette’s house. With the severe storm past, traffic had begun to pick up to what Dean assumed was typical for a Saturday night in Clayton Falls. Big mistake. This Saturday night would be anything but typical.</p><p>Although Dean had only met Sophie mere hours ago, he felt responsible for her current crisis. Maybe not in a direct cause and effect way. But in the sense that he may have put her on the night hag’s radar. He and Sam had been trying to thwart the effects of the living nightmares, and now they had attacked the monster directly, if unsuccessfully. Supernatural creatures tended to notice the hunters trying to gank them. So it was possible that Sophie had become a target merely by her association with him and Sam. And judging by the previously calm and collected woman’s state of panic on the phone, Dean couldn’t get there soon enough.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Sam asked, braced in the passenger seat as Dean pushed the Impala thirty miles per hour over the speed limit while zigzagging in out and out of oncoming traffic lanes.</p><p>“She said everything was falling apart,” Dean said. “I heard a loud crash in the background.”</p><p>“Another earthquake?”</p><p>“Don’t know,” Dean said. He’d heard raw terror in Sophie’s voice. “Something big.” A few moments later, he pointed to a green-and-beige wooden sign ahead on the right. “That’s her development. Eagle Crest.”</p><p>He turned right at the sign and took the first left.</p><p>“Dean! Look out!”</p><p>Something dark plummeted out of the sky in front of them—flashing through the headlight beams—and struck the asphalt, shattering into several pieces. Dean swerved to avoid the mess. He glanced out the side window.</p><p>“Rocks... and clumps of dirt.”</p><p>Seconds later, more rocks fell from the sky, striking the road, the sidewalks and parked cars, breaking windows, spider-webbing windshields. Car alarms began to wail. Smaller stones pinged off the hood and roof of the Impala, while others rattled around in the wheel wells. As Dean took the second right he slammed on the brakes. The Impala pulled up several feet in front of a huge sinkhole blocking both lanes of residential traffic. A gray Ford minivan had rolled onto its side in the hole.</p><p>Shifting into reverse, Dean backed up a hundred feet, and swerved under the protective canopy of a large tree. Considering the fate of Max Barnes, he hoped it was a safe location.</p><p>“It’s not far,” he said. “Gotta hoof it.”</p><p>“You bring hardhats this time?”</p><p>“Something better,” Dean said as he climbed out of the Impala. With his forearm shielding his head, he jogged up a curved driveway to a two-door garage and took the molded plastic lids off two trashcans. As he handed the spare to Sam, he received a skeptical look in return.</p><p>“Better than hardhats?”</p><p>“More coverage,” Dean said.</p><p>“If you say so.”</p><p>With the makeshift shields over their heads, they ran along the sidewalk past the large sinkhole. Rocks occasionally thudded against the plastic lids which, for the most part, protected them from what would have been nasty scalp lacerations, if not fractured skulls. The lids weren’t foolproof, though. One rock hit Sam’s shoulder and another clipped Dean’s knee.</p><p>Dean took the first left and halted so suddenly Sam almost bowled him over. Stunned, they stared at the extent of the damage without comment. Two of the houses on adjoining one acre lots looked as if a wrecking ball had been hammering them all day. Porticos toppled, front walls destroyed, chimneys crumbled in ruins, interior rooms exposed to the night, walls leaning at untenable angles, on the verge of collapse. Dean might have blamed the tornado or earthquake activity, but the sinkhole they’d almost fallen into had the signature of one particular dreamer.</p><p>In nearby houses, neighbors pressed frightened faces to their windows but stayed indoors to avoid the falling rocks. Their houses were havens, but for how long? If the sinkholes spread, the police would need to evacuate the whole development. Scratch that. They’d better evacuate everyone regardless.</p><p>“Which one’s Sophie’s house?” Sam asked.</p><p>“The one on the left,” Dean said.</p><p>As he spoke, he heard a woman’s voice calling for help.</p><h2><span id="chapter-28">CHAPTER 28</span><a href="#chapter-28" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean ran across the street with Sam on his heels. The house on the right creaked and groaned, shifting toward the left, minutes from collapsing. From behind that house, a father, mother and two young children emerged. They were all in pajamas, the children, a boy and a girl, crying softly as their parents held them close.</p><p>“That’s Sophie Bessette’s house,” the mother said pointing. “She’s trapped inside.”</p><p>“I know,” Dean said. He handed the woman his trashcan lid while Sam passed his to the father. “Use those. Find cover. Under a tree. Or inside a neighbor’s house.”</p><p>As if to emphasize Dean’s warning, a series of rocks pelted the second-story roof of the family’s house, bounced and dropped with thuds onto the front lawn. Looking as if they were trying to evade sniper fire, the family sprinted for the nearest tree.</p><p>Edging past the collapsed portico, Dean tried the front door of Sophie’s house, but it was jammed in the twisted frame. First-floor windows to the right had shattered, looking like hungry maws with crystal teeth. Dean took out his handgun and ran the barrel along the edges of the window frame, clearing away the jagged glass.</p><p>Entering the development from the side opposite the sinkhole, a police cruiser rolled up, lights flashing. Senior Patrol Officer Carleen Phillips jogged across the front lawn, holding up a hand.</p><p>“Wait! I’ve called for fire and rescue units.”</p><p>Another patrol officer Dean hadn’t met joined her, hand poised on the hilt of his gun, as if he thought shooting someone might improve the situation.</p><p>The house on the right creaked again. Then a boom sounded, as if a joist had split in half.</p><p>The creaking intensified.</p><p>“No time,” Dean said. “Woman trapped inside.”</p><p>“We have gas lines here,” Phillips said. “These houses could blow.”</p><p>“This whole block’s in danger,” Sam said. “You need to evacuate everyone.”</p><p>“Probably a good idea,” Phillips said. She flinched as a rock dropped inches from her face. “C’mon, Callahan. Let’s go knock on some doors.”</p><p>Dean ducked through the window and found himself inside a house that looked as if a giant’s hand was in the process of crushing it. The walls were split, wood bursting through drywall. The hardwood floor had buckled upward in some places, sagged in others. In the middle of the living room, a hole had opened up and swallowed a coffee table and an entertainment center.</p><p>“Sophie!” he shouted.</p><p>“Upstairs,” she yelled. “I’m stuck.”</p><p>Dean mounted the staircase carefully. The banister railing was split in two places and several steps and risers had shattered from lateral pressure. He skipped those that looked unable to bear any weight.</p><p>Sam climbed through the window after him and looked around.</p><p>The house trembled and support beams groaned. The ceiling above the living room had sagged, raining bits of debris down in a hazy dust cloud that made breathing difficult.</p><p>“Dean, this place is right over a sinkhole,” Sam said.</p><p>“I noticed,” Dean said. “Warn me if anything... bad happens.”</p><p>“Like a natural gas explosion?”</p><p>“Yeah. Like that.”</p><p>“You’ll be the first to know.”</p><p>If the downstairs looked bad, the upstairs was worse. Dean found Sophie lying on her side in a doorway. The door had shattered into several pieces and was wedged into the collapsing doorjamb, pinning Sophie’s ankle even as it propped up the weight that would otherwise come crashing down on top of her.</p><p>“You came,” she said, the look of relief on her face palpable.</p><p>“You called,” Dean said. Her white blouse was smeared with dust and dirt but not blood. “Hurt anywhere? Besides the ankle.”</p><p>“Don’t think so,” she said. “Are you here to amputate my foot?”</p><p>“I’d like to avoid that if possible.”</p><p>“Makes two of us.”</p><p>“But we don’t have time to wait for the Jaws of Life to pry you out of there.”</p><p>“Suppose not.”</p><p>“Do you have a golf club?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Dean called down the stairs. “Sam, we need a crowbar!”</p><p>“I have a baseball bat,” Sophie said.</p><p>“Baseball?”</p><p>“For protection,” she said. “I dislike guns.”</p><p>“Might work,” Dean said.</p><p>A few seconds later he’d navigated the distorted perspective of her twisted bedroom and retrieved the baseball bat from her closet. He worked the thin end of the bat under a gap near where her ankle was trapped.</p><p>“On three, I want you to pull your foot out. Move as far from this doorway as you can. And cover your face.”</p><p>“Pull, move, cover,” she said. “Got it.”</p><p>“One... two... three!”</p><p>Dean pressed upward, pushing a section of the doorway up. For a second, the pressure on Sophie’s bloody ankle was released and she scrambled out of the way. Pieces of the shattered door cracked and split and vanished under the collapsing wall. A loud rumble filled the house and the wall continued to twist and fall. The floor beneath them began to heave like the deck of a storm-tossed ship.</p><p>“We gotta move!” Dean cried.</p><p>He grabbed Sophie’s hand, pulled her up, and helped her to the top of the stairs. The banister railing was gone and the stairs had tilted at a thirty-degree angle. All around them wood cracked and split, window glass crashed, drywall broke and shattered, creating more plumes of suffocating dust.</p><p>“C’mon!” Dean encouraged Sophie.</p><p>Dean helped support the limping Sophie along the twisting staircase. It was like running along a rotating balance beam. The living-room sofa had fallen lengthwise into the expanding sinkhole. A series of crashes sounded from the back of the house. Dean guessed the kitchen cabinets had opened and disgorged their contents. They both fell on the stairs, but continued to scramble down, on hands and knees, and finally reached the bottom where Sam waited, holding a crowbar. Dean was about to help Sophie through the slowly collapsing broken window, when Sam caught his arm.</p><p>“Wait,” he said and wedged the crowbar in the window. “This should buy us a few seconds.”</p><p>Sophie slipped through first, then Dean, and finally Sam. He yanked the crowbar out and jumped back as the window frame disintegrated under the weight of the wall. They raced away from the ruined house, Sophie favoring her ankle.</p><p>“Looks like the rocks have stopped falling,” Sam commented.</p><p>Lights flashing, a fire truck arrived, tooting its horn. A steady stream of cars flowed around the emergency vehicles as Phillips and Callahan routed them away from the huge sinkhole.</p><p>The house next to Sophie’s shifted too far off center and large sections splintered and broke away, until the left side was a shattered ruin. Light flashed and an explosion roared, engulfing both homes. The concussion wave shattered windows in adjacent houses and blasted debris into the street, pelting cars and emergency vehicles. Callahan and Phillips dropped to the ground defensively.</p><p>Dean, Sam, and Sophie staggered from the force of the explosion. Waves of heat flashed over them, instantly evaporating perspiration. Chunks of burning wood and charred bricks and siding fell much too close for comfort. As they jogged to the Impala, Dean’s ears were ringing. Felt like he had earplugs stuffed in both ears. In the distance, another explosion lit the night sky and the ground trembled.</p><p>The tree above the Impala was leaning over the street, some of its branches low enough to brush the roof of the car. Roots on the far side of the tree had risen up between broken slabs of sidewalk. They jumped in the car and Dean swung it around in a sweeping 180-degree turn to exit the development before the rest of the street dropped out from under them.</p><p>“My house,” Sophie said from the backseat, her voice a soft monotone. “My home... is gone.”</p><p>“You’re alive,” Dean said.</p><p>“Am I? This feels like a dream.”</p><p>“It’s somebody’s dream,” Sam said. “But not yours.”</p><p>Sam’s cell phone rang.</p><p>“Jeffries,” he told Dean and took the call. “Okay. We’re on our way.”</p><p>“What now?” Dean asked after Sam ended the call.</p><p>“Nazi zombies are back.”</p><p>The one who dreamed of the collapsing underground would never dream again.</p><p>Old before she first claimed him, he had little more to give her. She left his withered remains and moved to the next victim in her familiar path. This one was young, with enough vital energy to feed her for days before expiring. She slipped into his home, as insubstantial as an errant breeze, and flowed into his room, nudging him toward sleep so she could slip into his fertile subconscious...</p><p>Trevor Deetz hunched over the student desk in his bedroom. His mom had warned him not to wait until the last minute again to work on his latest project, a World War II book report due Monday morning. Peeved, he had retreated to his bedroom and slammed his door. Fine. He would finish the damn thing before Sunday morning even if he stayed awake all night to complete it. Then maybe she’d get off his freakin’ case for once.</p><p>Unfortunately, the reading assignment was a boring book written by some old geezer with a fondness for dates and statistics that made Trevor roll his eyes. Instead of finishing the book, he sat hunched over his desk reading the end of the Hitler’s Zombie Force graphic novel. Now this guy knew how to tell a story. The Allies were winning the war, so a desperate Hitler decided to zombify his entire army. Any soldier unwilling to make the undead sacrifice for the Fatherland was summarily shot.</p><p>More Nazi zombies than ever, he thought. How cool is that?</p><p>Despite the rising excitement in the final pages of the graphic novel, Trevor couldn’t help yawning. He closed his eyes and rested his head on the desk, falling asleep in seconds.</p><h2><span id="chapter-29">CHAPTER 29</span><a href="#chapter-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean followed Bell Street eastward with a sense of déjà vu, passing the intersection where they’d witnessed a pack of Velociraptors hunt a Honda Civic driven by Paul Hanes. The downed utility pole had been patched to restore the lines but was still a repair in progress. And when Dean turned onto Arcadia Boulevard, he once again saw police cars in the middle of the street and Nazi zombies looking for meals on legs. A full block short of the nearest zombie, Dean swung the Impala onto the shoulder of the road to allow enough time to raid the trunk of the car for extra ammo.</p><p>Twisting around to face Sophie in the back seat, Dean said, “Stay in the car. Lock the doors.”</p><p>“My ankle has swelled like a balloon,” she said. “Don’t think I’m going anywhere under my own power.”</p><p>“Just as well,” Sam said. “This will get messy.”</p><p>As Dean and Sam circled to the back of the Impala, Sophie double-checked the locks. Inside the trunk, Dean opened a case with spare magazines for their guns and handed two to Sam, taking two more for himself. In the distance, he heard the staccato pops of gunshots mingled with hysterical screams.</p><p>They ran south along Arcadia. Dean tracked left and right for concealed zombies. He didn’t want a repeat of his last close encounter. Behind a chalk-smeared sandwich board, a young Nazi officer in a white summer tunic turned toward them, staggering into their path. A loop of intestines dangled from a nasty abdominal wound. Dean raised his arm, braced his hand and put a round through the zombie’s forehead.</p><p>Adding to the chaos, several people slipped out of stores and restaurants, yelling and screaming as they raced away from the undead abominations. A shrieking woman picked up her young, crying daughter and lumbered awkwardly down the street on a broken heel. An overweight man wearing a business suit and gripping a briefcase in both hands tripped and fell, breaking the briefcase and barely managing to escape from a zombie soldier’s clutching fingers. The man scrambled away on hands and knees until he could regain his feet and flee. Papers fluttered in his wake.</p><p>In the middle of the street, an older field marshal in a fulllength leather trench coat spotted them and lumbered into their path. Sam drilled a round through his eye.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said. “These aren’t just Nazi zombies...”</p><p>Dean nodded. “They’re the same Nazi zombies we already killed.”</p><p>“Regenerated,” Sam said. “Like the Charger each night.”</p><p>“Night hag’s playing her golden oldies.”</p><p>“Until she burns out the dreamer.”</p><p>Three soldiers in green helmets and uniforms rose from behind the cover of an open police-cruiser door with blood and gobbets of flesh dripping from their cracked and jagged teeth. Dean shot one under the chin. Sam caught the other two with headshots. As they passed the police cruiser, they stopped. The zombies hadn’t taken cover behind the cruiser. They had been feeding.</p><p>The ravaged body of Darren Nash, the portly Fremont Ledger reporter who’d been interviewing people in C.J.’s Diner, lay sprawled on the ground, missing half his throat and large portions of his upper arms and thighs. One of his eyes was missing, along with part of his cheek. The other eye stared lifelessly into the night sky. His notebook, now spattered with drops of blood, was clutched in his hand. Several pages flapped in the breeze, flashing the details of a story he hadn’t lived to tell.</p><p>“I did not need to see that,” Dean said and turned away from the corpse.</p><p>“Wait a minute, Dean,” Sam said, catching his brother’s arm.</p><p>Dean looked back. “What—?”</p><p>Then he saw.</p><p>The fingers of the empty hand twitched. Then the head lolled to the side. The remaining eye moved slowly in its socket until it located them. Moaning, the reporter pushed himself up with his bloody arms and slowly climbed to his feet. His head hung to the side from his ruined throat. Uttering a wet grunt, he staggered one step toward Dean, then another, reaching out with straining fingers.</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“Perception is—“</p><p>“Reality,” Dean said. “Yeah, I know.”</p><p>He aimed his gun, the end of the barrel less than a yard from the man’s forehead. Without a second thought, he pulled the trigger, blasting half the reporter’s brain and the back of his skull from his head.</p><p>“Hey! They shot Nash!” a voice called.</p><p>Dean turned.</p><p>A Hispanic Colorado State Patrol officer pointed from him to Sam with the barrel of his gun.</p><p>“Drop your weapons!” he commanded.</p><p>“They’re FBI, Valdez,” Officer Wild said. “Watch—!”</p><p>“Look out!” Sam called.</p><p>Valdez turned around and stood face to face with a ravenous SS officer in a black uniform, peaked cap, and swastika armband. They stood too close together for the others to take a clear shot. The state cop shoved his firearm into the gut of the Nazi zombie and fired round after round to no effect. The zombie ignored the abdominal wounds and ripped a chunk out of Valdez’s throat. Blood sprayed from a torn artery but Valdez continued firing until he exhausted his magazine. The zombie clutched Valdez by the shoulders and continued to tear into his flesh, even as his own midsection separated above his hips, his legs falling sideways. The upper torso of the zombie rode the state cop to the ground, continuing to eat long after the light had faded from Valdez’s eyes.</p><p>Officer Cerasi, gun drawn, ran up beside Wild and looked down.</p><p>“Oh, God...”</p><p>Spinning away he bent over and vomited.</p><p>Wild walked up to the feeding zombie, aimed her weapon at the back of his head, but averted her gaze from Valdez’s remains as she pulled the trigger.</p><p>Dean and Sam joined the cops.</p><p>“Now, Valdez,” Dean said. “Or he’ll come back as one of them.”</p><p>“I—I can’t...” she said and turned away from them.</p><p>Dean looked down at the bloody state cop, lying beneath the truly dead zombie’s torso. His eyes were wide open and unblinking.</p><p>“Poor bastard,” Dean said and took the shot.</p><p>More screams sounded, coming from a nearby Italian restaurant, one they had already passed, Mama Ferracci’s. Sam cast a grim look at Dean.</p><p>“The zombies are inside!” he called, running toward the restaurant.</p><p>Two bodies crashed through the plate-glass window, a Clayton Falls man, wrestling with a Nazi soldier whose jaw snapped repeatedly so hard they could hear the teeth striking each other from fifteen feet away. The soldier’s hand had clawed the man’s face, but so far he’d managed to hold the snapping teeth at bay with a firm grip on the soldier’s hair. If the soldier noticed or cared that his scalp was slowly tearing away, he showed no sign of it.</p><p>Sam strode forward and swung his booted foot at the soldier’s head, connecting just under the jaw and elevating the zombie’s torso enough to get off a clean shot through his temple. He looked down at the relieved restaurant patron.</p><p>“Were you bit?” he demanded.</p><p>The man climbed hastily to his feet, ran his hands over his arms, and gingerly touched his face and neck.</p><p>“No. No, I don’t think so. Scratched. Not bit.”</p><p>“You’re lucky,” Dean said. “Now go home.”</p><p>“My wife,” the man said. “She went to the restroom before those... those things appeared out of nowhere. She’s still in the restaurant.”</p><p>“We’ll handle it,” Sam said.</p><p>When Dean and Sam entered Mama Ferracci’s, they saw the problem. A dozen patrons were trapped in the back corner of the place, surrounded by at least as many zombies. Some civilians cowered against the wall, backs turned, whimpering in fear while another yelled hysterically for somebody to please God do something. But a few diners held chairs up, like lion tamers in a circus, jabbing the chair legs at the zombies each time they tried to grab somebody. Because the zombies were impervious to pain, they took the abuse and continued to edge closer to their intended victims.</p><p>Wild and a few other cops entered the restaurant behind the Winchesters and took in the situation.</p><p>“More than last time,” Wild observed.</p><p>“Head shots,” Dean said for the benefit of the new cops.</p><p>“Not as easy as it sounds,” Sam said softly to Dean.</p><p>The difficulty was that the restaurant patrons were behind the zombies. One miss or a through-and-through shot and they would kill or maim innocent people.</p><p>“Guess we get up close and personal,” Dean said.</p><p>He crossed the restaurant with Sam beside him. The cops followed, spreading out to avoid friendly fire, and seemingly reluctant to tangle with zombies.</p><p>Dean grabbed the first zombie soldier by the collar and yanked him backward. At his side, Sam had a clean line of fire and took it, splattering zombie brains over a watercolor map of Italy. Then Sam pulled back the zombie closest to him, and Dean took the shot from the opposite direction.</p><p>When Dean killed a third soldier, he saw a young officer in a white tunic. Dean spun the man around.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Sam saw it too.</p><p>The loop of intestine hanging from the abdominal wound.</p><p>“Same damn zombie we killed outside!”</p><p>Dean shoved the white-clad officer onto a round table draped in a red-and-white checkered tablecloth, and shot him in the brain stem.</p><p>“You know what this means,” Sam said.</p><p>“Running on a friggin’ treadmill,” Dean responded.</p><p>The Winchesters backed away from the zombies. Dean turned to Officer Wild.</p><p>“You know what to do?”</p><p>She nodded. But instead of grabbing a zombie, she removed the extendible baton from her belt and snapped it open. Stepping forward, she whipped it across the head of the nearest zombie, the graying field marshal with the fulllength leather trench coat. The old man staggered sideways, but she’d commanded his attention. Turning to face her, he bore down on her, arms raised to grab her even as he opened his hungry maw to bite.</p><p>Cerasi moved to the side, mirroring the Winchesters’ technique, and blew the field marshal’s brains out. The other cops took out their batons and joined the fight. With the situation basically in hand, the Winchesters retreated to the front of the restaurant.</p><p>“They’re regenerating minutes after we kill them,” Dean said.. “She’s playing with us.”</p><p>“We waste time attacking the symptoms,” Sam added, “not the cause.”</p><p>They heard more screaming outside and ran back into the street. Dean looked south and north for the source of the cry. His eyes locked on a black-clad Nazi SS officer standing hunched over beside the Impala.</p><p>“No!” Dean yelled and sprinted to his car. “No!”</p><p>I’m too late, he realized with horror. Too late.</p><p>Sophie Bessette had been pulled through the broken side window and was thrashing in the SS officer’s arms, one of which looked broken in several places from punching it through the window. Behind the black-clad Nazi zombie, Sophie’s body was obscured. Dean hesitated, holding his gun extended at eye level, to make sure Sophie wouldn’t be in the line of fire. When he saw her head flop down near the zombie’s elbow, he fired a high shot, catching the undead officer in the back, between his hunched shoulder blades. The zombie straightened, twisted his head around to look back over his shoulder. Seeing the satisfied grin on the zombie’s face, with fresh blood staining his jagged teeth and dripping from his chin, Dean lost it.</p><p>Roaring in anger, Dean emptied his magazine, firing round after round into the zombie’s face until his magazine was empty. He ejected the spent magazine, slammed another into the grip, released the slide and continued to fire, so he could blast that evil grin all the way to hell.</p><p>With nothing much left above the stump of his neck, the zombie SS officer released his victim and swayed side to side. Lunging forward, Dean kicked the zombie in the chest, knocking him clear of Sophie’s prostrate form.</p><p>“No, no, no,” Dean whispered as he knelt beside her.</p><p>Gently, he turned her over—and flinched when he saw her white blouse soaked with blood. Her throat had been torn open, much of the flesh gone. Above and below her collarbone, chunks of flesh had been ripped out with such force that the clavicle itself was fractured in two places. Her dark, tousled hair was sticky and matted with blood. And her eyes were wide open, seemingly caught in a moment of terror or disbelief.</p><p>“Sophie, I’m...” Dean looked away, unable to face that accusatory stare. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Dean eased her body to the ground, stood up and backed away.</p><p>“Dean...” Sam was beside him.</p><p>“Sammy, I can’t... I can’t, man.”</p><p>Dean turned his back.</p><p>Sam understood. Dean heard his boot scuff against the asphalt as he took a step toward Sophie’s body. Squeezing his eyes shut, Dean waited for the sound, anticipated the sound, but the sudden crack still felt like a body blow.</p><p>“It’s done,” Sam said.</p><p>His hand fell on Dean’s shoulder and he squeezed.</p><p>“Dean, we will kill this night hag bitch,” Sam said. “Promise.”</p><p>Dean nodded. He took a tarp from the trunk and laid it over her body, while steadfastly averting his gaze from her face. When he returned to the driver’s side of the Impala, he heard a low menacing growl. Stepping to the side, he spotted the large gray wolf crouched behind the car, its snout curled back to reveal impressive fangs in a foaming mouth.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Dean muttered. He pulled his gun and fired a round right between its glowing amber eyes. The wolf dropped to the ground and vanished. Other wolves approached from the left and right, slinking out from the shadows between the commercial buildings on Arcadia.</p><p>With Sam covering the west side of the street and Dean taking the east, they brought down the wolves, one after another. To kill the wolves head shots were a luxury not a necessity. But Dean had the idea that a wounded and incapacitated rabid wolf might be better than a dead one.</p><p>“If they’re not dead, maybe they won’t regenerate,” he pointed out.</p><p>The dead ones vanished. But tonight, the truly dead zombie corpses weren’t disappearing as they had the previous night. The zombie manifestations were stronger somehow, having a permanence the wolves lacked. So far.</p><p>When an ambulance rushed down the street, Dean flagged the driver down by waving his FBI credentials and led one of the paramedics to Sophie’s body.</p><p>“Take care of her,” he instructed.</p><p>“But she’s already...”</p><p>Sam caught the man’s arm and whispered fiercely, “Get her out of the street before the wolves get her.”</p><p>The man looked down at Sam’s hand gripping his arm, and the gun held in a white-knuckled grip in the other and nodded. “Sure. No problem.”</p><p>“Good,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean drove in silence back to the diner, jaw clenched, hands tight on the steering wheel.</p><p>No more chasing symptoms, he thought. We will find you and end you.</p><h2><span id="chapter-30">CHAPTER 30</span><a href="#chapter-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The life energy of the fourteen-year-old boy flowed into the nocnitsa.</p><p>While Trevor Deetz slept hunched over his desk, she perched on his back and shoulders, like a bird of prey. But instead of plucking his eyes from their sockets, she wrapped the elongated fingers of her hands around his forehead and snatched the nightmare images from his mind and gave them shape in the real world. And all the while, his energy flowed into her, giving her shadowy body form and substance and heightening her powers. Those within her sphere of influence, which encompassed the whole town, bled fear into the air. Their night terror would take shape and plague them, a vicious circle of darkness from which none would escape. Soon she wouldn’t need to feed directly from them to become more powerful. She would reach into any mind she chose and unspool the darkness within. Their power would flow to her, first one-to-one and then many-to-one, until only shriveled husks remained.</p><p>As she absorbed more power from the boy, his body trembled beneath her gripping hands and feet, resisting the draw—and failing. In a few moments his legs jittered up and down and his head bucked, thumping repeatedly against the books and papers piled on his desk. His mind was attempting to throw off the psychic yoke, to rouse him from the dream state which fed her, but she was too powerful now and the energy was so delicious...</p><p>Sam watched Dean behind the wheel out of the corner of his eye. His brother hadn’t known Sophie Bessette long, but he was taking her loss hard. He knew that Dean felt guilty, that he felt he’d broken his promise to keep her safe. Couple that with abandoning the zombie battle and having no idea how to locate the nocnitsa and the night was adding up to one big loss. But they had no choice but to leave. The battle couldn’t be won because the deck was stacked against them. Sooner or later they would fall to the regenerating zombies and the war would be lost as well. The only way to win the night was to attack the night hag directly.</p><p>As they neared the diner, several fire trucks roared past, horns blaring and emergency lights pulsing, followed by two ambulances with wailing sirens. Judging from the names on the sides of the emergency vehicles, assistance was arriving from nearby towns. No matter which direction Sam looked, he could spot one or two house fires burning. In light of the garment factory tragedy and its human cost, Sam imagined a lot of the town’s residents had nightmares about fire.</p><p>The parking lot of C.J.’s Diner was at half capacity. Alarmed faces stared out the windows rather than at their plates or dining companions. Parked in the walking lane near the diner’s entrance was the police chief ‘s cruiser. Sam guessed the man was checking on his daughter and couldn’t blame him. The rhythmic thumping of helicopters reached a crescendo overhead then faded as they angled toward distant fires and their blinking lights receded in the night sky.</p><p>“Medical choppers,” Sam noted.</p><p>“Or press,” Dean said cynically.</p><p>Dean paused on the metal stairs leading up to the diner’s front entrance and pointed downward. Sam looked and saw the spots. Blood.</p><p>They entered the diner and angled toward the booth where they’d left Lucy Quinn. Sitting opposite her was Millie, the police receptionist and a distinguished-looking man with silvering hair, wearing a white dress shirt under a charcoalgray suit jacket.</p><p>“Is that...?”</p><p>“Dr. Gruesome,” Dean said. “Cleans up well.”</p><p>Standing in front of the booth, cradling his left arm, Chief Quinn was talking urgently to his daughter. When Sam reached the man’s side, he saw the problem with his arm and indicated the wound to Dean with a slight nod of his head.</p><p>The dark sleeve of the chief ‘s uniform shirt was torn to shreds at the forearm and soaked with blood. Through the gaps in the cloth, Sam saw the man’s flesh had been ravaged by deep, jagged lacerations.</p><p>Bite wounds.</p><p>“What happened?” Sam asked.</p><p>From the dark look Dean gave him, Sam knew he was wondering which of them would have to put the chief down before he became one of the undead.</p><p>“Wolf bit me,” Quinn said. “Right outside the municipal building. I put it down, but not before he took a chunk out of my arm and nearly knocked me senseless.”</p><p>“You’ll need rabies shots,” Dean said, relief in his voice.</p><p>“I’ll have its brain tissue tested.”</p><p>“Did you wound it or kill it?”</p><p>“Gut shot,” Quinn said. “If it wasn’t dead when I left, it is now.”</p><p>“The dead wolves vanish,” Dean said. “Nothing to test. Besides, testing would be a waste of time. They’re all rabid.”</p><p>“You’ve seen more of these wolves?”</p><p>“Killed or maimed seven on Arcadia,” Sam said. “All rabid.”</p><p>“How can you know?”</p><p>“Because,” Jozef Wieczorek said, “I’ve seen the movie.”</p><p>“You too?” Chief Quinn asked Wieczorek, shaking his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Dad, whether you want to believe it or not,” Lucy said, impatiently. “Weird stuff is really happening.”</p><p>“I don’t know how any of this is happening,” Quinn said. “But I know when I need help. I’ve asked the governor to mobilize the National Guard.”</p><p>“How long?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Day. Maybe two.”</p><p>Sam exchanged a look with Dean. Not soon enough.</p><p>Quinn squeezed Lucy’s shoulder with his good hand and kissed her on the cheek.</p><p>“Stay here,” he said. “You need an escort home, call me.”</p><p>“Okay, Dad. Be careful.”</p><p>Chief Quinn nodded gravely to Sam and Dean, almost as if he were putting his daughter in their care, and walked toward the exit.</p><p>“Rabies shots!” Dean called after him.</p><p>Quinn nodded before he left. One way or another, the man would get treated for rabies. If the animal isn’t caught and tested, you get the shots as soon as possible, because the prospect of contracting rabies is too terrible. Assuming he survived the night. Assuming the town survived the night. At the moment, the odds weren’t looking good.</p><h2><span id="chapter-31">CHAPTER 31</span><a href="#chapter-31" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “What have you got?”</p><p>Lucy slid across the booth, making room for Dean and Sam to sit.</p><p>A large map of Clayton Falls covered the table. Red X marks with scribbled notations were scattered in a dozen locations. Millie had a stack of papers under her arm. Details of the emergency calls placed over the last two nights, Sam assumed.</p><p>“We went through Millie’s logs and put an X wherever something was reported,” Wieczorek said.</p><p>Millie nodded. “Plus, Wanda, the overnight dispatcher, has been calling us whenever she has a free minute with information on the calls coming in tonight.”</p><p>“What about the names next to the X marks and incident descriptions?” Sam asked.</p><p>“That’s who called in the incident,” Lucy said.</p><p>Dean saw the problem. “We have the nightmares and the witnesses, but we don’t know who is having each nightmare.”</p><p>“That’s simple,” Betsy, the smiling server said as she stepped up to the table with a coffee pot in one hand and two mugs dangling from the other. Her ubiquitous smile had become frayed, more habit now than anything else, and her hands trembled. “Everybody’s having nightmares. That’s all anyone is talking about.” She placed the mugs down at the edge of the table, next to the map. “Normally, I’d offer decaff, but under the circumstances...”</p><p>“You know who is having nightmares?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yes, mostly,” she said, slightly taken aback by Sam’s intensity.</p><p>“The type of nightmares?”</p><p>“If I haven’t heard directly, Clara or Paige from the morning shift or Jesse—“</p><p>“Grab a chair,” Sam said.</p><p>Betsy pursed her lips and shook her head. “I’m on duty.”</p><p>“C.J. won’t mind,” Dean said.</p><p>Lucy smiled. “There is no C.J. Those initials are from Charles Clayton and Jeremiah Falls, the town founders.”</p><p>“Whoever, then,” Dean said. “This is important.”</p><p>“Okay,” Betsy said. “I’ll do what I can.”</p><p>While she returned the coffee pot to the coffee station and grabbed a chair to bring to the table, Sam picked up the red marker.</p><p>“Let’s start with what we know.” He found Olga Kucharski’s house in the south section of town and circled it. “Olga Kucharski had dreams about the Charger and the Nightmare Theater monsters.”</p><p>“Others are watching Doc’s show,” Dean said. “We got wolves after she was drained.”</p><p>“But the night hag fed directly off Olga.”</p><p>“Fed? Eww,” Lucy said, tucking her chin down with a visible shudder.</p><p>“This night hag—a real monster—it’s bringing the nightmares to life?” Wieczorek asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said. “I’ve seen it.”</p><p>“Incredible,” he said, shaking his head grimly.</p><p>“Goodness,” Millie said, her face pale with fright. “Real monsters...”</p><p>“Just one,” Dean said. This time. He turned to Sam. “Some of the manifestations are sticking around, even after death. Wolves vanished. Zombies didn’t.”</p><p>“She’s growing stronger,” Sam said. “Makes sense that manifestations created through direct feeding would be the first to have permanence.”</p><p>“Daniel Barnes,” Dean said, tapping the map. “Killer tree dreams.”</p><p>Sam circled the Barnes address. Betsy sat down facing the table and looked at the map.</p><p>“Roman Messerly had the natural disaster dreams. Lucy, what’s his address?”</p><p>She examined the map and pointed. Sam circled the location.</p><p>“But he wasn’t there tonight,” she said. “He was at his friend’s house. Here. And... this is where Rich—Officer Jeffries—told me they found him in his car.”</p><p>“What about the sinkholes? Falling rocks,” Dean said.</p><p>Betsy raised her hand slightly, as if requesting permission to speak.</p><p>“Ehrich Vogel,” she said.</p><p>“How do you know?” Sam asked.</p><p>“He’s a retired miner. Lived through the Croyden Creek cave-in. Crushed his right hand. Told me he still dreams about it, but lately they’ve been... vivid.”</p><p>“Got an address?”</p><p>Millie leaned forward and tapped her index finger on the map at a location to the northeast of the Kucharski house. Sam marked it.</p><p>“Ebola guy,” Dean said. “Gotta be the CDC old-timer we met in here.”</p><p>“Yes,” Betsy said. “Phil Meyerson said he never saw someone with hem—hemorrhagic fever but dreamt about one last night. He lives... here.”</p><p>She indicated an address in the northeast of Clayton Falls.</p><p>“The escaped serial killer,” Sam said. He had a momentary flash of Ragnar Bartch jumping toward him from the utility shed wielding a meat cleaver. “Must be that woman we met, with the fantasy artist roommate... Jylene something?”</p><p>Lucy cleared her throat. “That might be Alden.”</p><p>“Alden Webb? The warden?”</p><p>Lucy leaned forward conspiratorially.</p><p>“Hope I don’t get in trouble for this. Dad told me something. Alden—Warden Webb—said once that while he believes in the security at Falls Federal, he always worries about what would happen if...”</p><p>“If they escaped,” Sam finished.</p><p>She nodded. “Said it kept him on his toes. Eternal vigilance.”</p><p>“Then that would be his nightmare scenario,” Sam said, nodding. “Where’s he live?”</p><p>Lucy pointed out his address and Sam dutifully circled it.</p><p>“We’re forgetting about the zombies,” Dean said.</p><p>“Betsy?” Sam asked. “Anybody having zombie nightmares?”</p><p>She frowned. “No nightmares, but...”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well, Linda Deetz is always going on about how her son is crazy about zombies but she won’t let him watch any of the movies because they’re so violent and gory.”</p><p>“Address?” Sam asked. But nobody knew. “Phone book?”</p><p>Betsy shook her head. “Unlisted. She’s a single mom. Changed her number when her deadbeat ex kept calling at all hours of the night.”</p><p>“Jeffries can find it for us,” Sam said. “Lucy, you have his number?”</p><p>“Yeah, Dad treats him like the son he never had.”</p><p>Sam asked her to call for an address.</p><p>The dreamers they had identified lived along the perimeter of the town. But it wasn’t enough. They needed to know not only where the night hag was, but where she would go next. Of course, her feeding schedule could be totally random.</p><p>“What am I missing?” Sam asked rhetorically. “This thing feeds off negative energy...”</p><p>“Negative energy? Like the brownouts?” Betsy asked.</p><p>“What brownouts?” Dean asked.</p><p>“The people who’ve told me about their nightmares experienced brownouts. When they woke up, their electricity was out for a few seconds before coming back on. They thought maybe the flickering lights woke them.”</p><p>“When she fed on Olga,” Sam said, seeing the connection. “The lights inside the house, along with the streetlight out front, lost power temporarily.” Sam glanced down at the marked-up map again, crosschecking the times of the emergency calls—each living nightmare—with the person who had the nightmare. “That’s it. Negative energy.”</p><p>“Whatcha got, Sam?”</p><p>“The order of the nightmares.” Sam traced a semicircular path with his index finger, starting with Olga Kucharski’s house then moving to the northeast before coming back toward the north. “Widdershins.”</p><p>“Widder—what now?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Widdershins,” Sam repeated. “Counter clockwise movement. In witchcraft, some believe the use of widdershins movement creates negative magic or—“</p><p>“Negative energy.”</p><p>“And that’s more negative energy to feed her,” Sam said. “She’s feeding along the perimeter while most of the manifestations happen inside her negative energy circle.”</p><p>“We know she’s feeding in a counter clockwise pattern,” Dean said. “And she causes mini blackouts when she feeds.” He turned to Lucy, who was wrapping up her cell call to Jeffries. “Anything?”</p><p>“Rich’s got his hands full,” she said. “I heard a lot of gunfire in the background. Said he’ll look it up and call us as soon as possible.”</p><p>“Good,” Dean said. “What’s the highest point in town?”</p><p>“Easy,” Lucy said. “The clock tower over the municipal building. Dad would take me up there when I was a kid. But why’s that important?”</p><p>“We’ll need spotters,” Dean said.</p><p>Her phone rang. “It’s Rich again.” She listened for a moment and hung up. “He’s on his way. Be here in two minutes.”</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Sam noticed unusual movement. He turned to look out the window at their booth and saw what had caught his attention, the familiar shambling movement.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said. “We have a more immediate problem.”</p><p>Dean followed Sam’s gaze.</p><p>“They’re here.”</p><p>Nazi zombies. Well, at least one had made his way to the diner. The young officer with the exposed loop of intestine wearing the white tunic, which almost glowed under the streetlamps as he shuffled across the dark parking lot.</p><p>Other diner patrons started to notice the zombie with pointing and excited chatter. Three booths away, a woman screamed. People on the other side of the diner left their tables for a closer look at the source of the commotion. Several grabbed hats and jackets and rushed toward the exit.</p><p>If they all run out there now, they’ll be dragged down and killed, Sam thought. Then reanimate as zombies themselves, adding to the death toll and chaos. Hoping to avoid mass hysteria, Sam stood and held up his FBI credentials.</p><p>“Everybody, listen! A terrorist cell is using an airborne hallucinogen to prey on your fears, to make you see and experience horrible things. They want you out there, in the night, panicking. You can fight this. The safest place is inside. Stay here. Lock the doors.” If they stayed calm, kept control of their fears, they’d deprive the night hag of some negative energy. “My partner, Agent DeYoung, and I are trained to deal with this. Just... stay here. All of you. For your own protection.”</p><p>Relieved to have somebody willing to handle the unimaginable, people began nodding. Those standing by the door returned to their former booths and tables.</p><p>Millie leaned across the table and whispered to Dean, “Shouldn’t you tell them about the... monster?”</p><p>“They’re close to panic.” Dean spoke in hushed tones. “We’d rather not push them over the edge. They need to believe this is manageable. Dangerous, yes, but manageable. And it is. This is what we do.”</p><p>Sam looked to Dean and together, after instructing Betsy to lock the door behind them, they went outside.</p><h2><span id="chapter-32">CHAPTER 32</span><a href="#chapter-32" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Linda Deetz wasn’t surprised when the lights went out. She’d heard reports of the strong storms and lightning causing outages. No reason to think her house would escape the inconvenience. She’d stocked up on batteries and candles earlier in the day, just in case.</p><p>When the lights dimmed and then died, she took out a flashlight and spread lit candles around downstairs. What surprised her was that Trevor hadn’t come down or complained when the power died. Either he was still sulking, or listening to his iPod, or maybe he’d fallen asleep and hadn’t noticed. One less thing for her to deal with.</p><p>She poured herself a glass of Piccini Chianti and sat down in her favorite living-room chair to relax until power was restored. By the time she finished the glass and thought about having another, she heard banging from upstairs. She called out to Trevor but received no reply.</p><p>Within seconds, she began to worry. Deep-seated fears began to surface. As a single mom, she feared being a target for home invasion or worse. Setting her glass down softly on the coffee table, she hurried to the kitchen and picked up the telephone. When she heard only silence, no dial tone, her fears began to magnify. She grabbed her purse by the front door and took out her cell phone. For a brief moment, she saw she had no signal bars and then the display died.</p><p>Her heart raced as she fought to suppress the panic rising inside her. Trevor was upstairs but not answering her calls, possibly in danger from an intruder. Hurrying back to the kitchen, she looked around for a weapon and grabbed the first thing she saw: a cast-iron skillet. She climbed the stairs as quietly as she could, counting on surprise and her familiarity with the layout of her home to help overcome an intruder who was likely stronger and possibly better armed.</p><p>Easing open Trevor’s bedroom door, she almost gasped at what she saw by the moonlight streaming through his window. Somebody dressed in black, with his back to her, stood over her son in his chair. And Trevor was thrashing, as if the person was pinning him down—hurting him—but unable to cry out for help.</p><p>Anger taking over, she charged into the room, swinging the cast-iron skillet.</p><p>“Leave my son alone!” she screamed.</p><p>The base of the skillet connected with something... softer than she anticipated. And the intruder screeched—an inhuman sound—as the blow struck him. The dark shape whirled around and Linda felt weak-kneed at the flash of glowing red eyes she glimpsed before the intruder... dissolved.</p><p>Confused at what she had witnessed and unable to comprehend how the intruder had simply disappeared, she rushed to her son and shook him, her fear transformed into worry.</p><p>Groggy, Trevor slowly came to.</p><p>“What happened?” he mumbled.</p><p>“You’re okay,” she said, hugging him tightly. “You’re okay now.”</p><p>Moments later, when the lights came back on, she saw two streaks of gray in his hair, one on each side of his forehead running all the way to the nape of his neck.</p><p>Three zombies had shambled their way to C.J.’s Diner. Dean and Sam put them down efficiently with one head shot each from close range.</p><p>“Diner’s no longer safe,” Dean said.</p><p>“If it ever was.”</p><p>Lights flashing, a police cruiser swung into the parking lot and stopped in front of them. Jeffries stepped out from the driver’s side. He had a state cop riding shotgun. Noticing the dead zombies in the parking lot, Jeffries frowned.</p><p>“Damn. They’re spreading,” he said.</p><p>“You got info on Linda Deetz?” Dean asked.</p><p>Jeffries nodded. “Her phone and electric were dead. Just got through. Says she chased an intruder out of her son’s room.”</p><p>Dean exchanged a look with Sam. “She get a look?”</p><p>“It was dark,” Jeffries said. “Said he wore black. Red eyes. Goggles? She hit him with a skillet and he disappeared somehow. She was a bit hysterical, so...”</p><p>“Disappeared sounds about right,” Sam said. “If she moved on, maybe that ends the zombie manifestations.”</p><p>“Don’t know,” Dean said, striking the toe of his boot against white-tunic zombie. “Still solid. Maybe they’re not over until the current batch is all dead.”</p><p>Behind them, the diner’s front door deadbolt turned. Lucy, Millie, and Jozef Wieczorek came down the stairs.</p><p>“I told everyone inside we had information for you,” Lucy explained. “What now?”</p><p>“That depends,” Dean said and turned to Jeffries. “Can you get us binoculars, some spare two-way radios and access to the clock tower?”</p><p>“Yes, to all three.”</p><p>“Good,” Dean said. “Then here’s the plan...”</p><p>Once Lucy explained that climbing a series of narrow switchback staircases was the only way to ascend the clock tower, Millie elected to remain at the diner. That left Jozef Wieczorek and Lucy in the role of spotters. With the state cop staying behind to temporarily guard the diner alone, the others drove to the municipal building.</p><p>Once there, Jeffries gave Lucy and Wieczorek a two-way radio, binoculars, and a key to the clock tower entrance. After handing Dean and Sam two-way radios, Jeffries rejoined his temporary partner. Together they would defend the diner while Dean and Sam took positions to ambush the night hag.</p><p>Dean glanced at the map, double-checking the warden’s address.</p><p>The radio Sam held squawked. Lucy’s voice. “We’re in position. Three-sixty view. Six... seven fires burning. Some existing power outages. But not in... Whoa! Looking northeast, it’s—it’s moving.”</p><p>Sam spoke into the radio. “What’s moving?”</p><p>“You said it was getting stronger... it’s like a black veil moving over the houses. The lights, they’re blotted out for a few moments as it moves over them. It’s moving counterclockwise, like you said, circling northwest.”</p><p>“If it’s moving,” Dean said, “it’s not feeding. Yet.”</p><p>“Good. We need to be in position,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean stared ahead as he drove north and felt himself zoning out, as if he’d been driving for hours, hypnotized by endless miles of road. Probably lack of sleep causing loss of focus. He tried to shake himself out of it, but then he glimpsed her, in his rearview mirror, running diagonally across the street, Ben beside her. One of the rabid wolves stalked them, ready to pounce.</p><p>Dean hit the brakes.</p><p>“Lisa!” Dean cried as he swung the Impala around. “Here with Ben. They’re in trouble, Sam.”</p><p>Sam looked over his shoulder.</p><p>“They’re not real, Dean. Can’t be. The real Lisa and Ben are at home. Safe. It’s the night hag. She’s using your fear against you.”</p><p>“How? I’m not asleep.”</p><p>“When you’re exhausted, your mind wanders. You’re having a waking nightmare. She’s stronger now. Maybe that’s all she needs to find a way into your subconscious.”</p><p>“Gotta help them, Sam. If I don’t—“</p><p>Sam grabbed his arm. “I saw something too, Dean. Yesterday. Something that wasn’t real. It’s all mind games. Your fears fuel her. If you give in now, she wins.”</p><p>“Damn!” Hitting the brakes again, Dean took a deep breath. He’d failed to protect Sophie. And he always worried that his being a hunter would bring danger to Lisa and Ben. With nightmares to prove it. Now the night hag’s psychic influence was jumbling his failure with his fears to mess with his mind. “You’re right. It’s not real. Lisa and Ben wouldn’t be here... Can’t believe I almost fell for it.”</p><p>Shaking his head, Dean resumed his original course and dropped Sam off near the warden’s house with his iron short-spear and lock picks. Then he drove to the home of Phil Meyerson, CDC retiree and parked half a block away. He didn’t need Lucy’s report over the radio to tell him when the night hag arrived and began to feed. The house and half the streetlights on the block went dark all at once.</p><p>“Going silent,” Dean said into the radio before turning the volume off. Sooner or later the radio would lose power, but he couldn’t know when. One ill-timed squawk from the speaker and he’d lose the element of surprise.</p><p>He sprinted up the block and hurried around the house along a bricked backyard patio to the rear door. Kneeling, he worked by sound and feel and had the lock picked within a minute.</p><p>Once inside the house, he waited quietly for a couple minutes more, long enough for the nocnitsa to assume solid form and begin feeding. But not too long. For all he knew, Meyerson’s subconscious was already creating an outbreak of bubonic plague in Clayton Falls.</p><p>Iron short-spear at the ready, Dean crept through the house.</p><p>One moment Jeffries was talking to Baumbach—his temporary state cop partner who was still freaked out about what he’d seen in Clayton Falls—and the next moment he saw them wink into existence at the entrance to the parking lot over a thin bed of white mist. Even though DeYoung and Shaw warned them what type of living nightmare they might see next, Jeffries wasn’t sure he would have fired so readily at seemingly ill people if he hadn’t seen their eerie appearingout- of-thin-air act himself. Baumbach stared in shocked dismay as Jeffries shot two of the hemorrhagic fever victims stumbling toward the diner.</p><p>“What the hell?” he whispered.</p><p>“They’re not real people, Baumbach,” Jeffries responded. “But their disease is contagious.”</p><p>Seven more appeared at various points around the diner, lurching forward, begging for help as blood ran from their ears, eyes, noses, and mouths, their voices choking on it as they moaned.</p><p>“Help! Help us! Please!”</p><p>As they came close enough to shoot, five more appeared behind them. Soon they would be overwhelmed by sheer numbers. Jeffries took aim, but saw out of the corner of his eye that Baumbach was paralyzed by dismay.</p><p>“Baumbach! Shoot!” he commanded urgently.</p><p>The state cop nodded abruptly. “O—okay.”</p><p>They fired together, Baumbach clearing the left side of the entrance, Jeffries taking the right. Jeffries wondered what the people inside the diner thought about them mowing down apparent civilians in distress, but shook it off. A moment later all the approaching bleeders—as he had begun to think of them to disassociate them from real human beings—disappeared. Even the ones on the ground vanished.</p><p>He got on the radio.</p><p>“DeYoung? Shaw? Is it over?”</p><p>After a few moments, DeYoung answered, his voice bitter with disappointment.</p><p>“No. Meyerson is dead.”</p><p>Wieczorek came on the channel.</p><p>“The creature is on the move.”</p><p>By the time Dean reached Meyerson, sitting on a sofa by a table lamp with a crossword puzzle in his lap, the man was dead and the night hag was gone. When he examined the body, he discovered that Meyerson hadn’t been reduced to a husk. He was wrinkled and old but not withered to skin and bones. The strain of the feeding must have killed him, Dean thought. Either a heart attack or a stroke. He turned on the radio to report his findings and to warn Sam he was up next.</p><p>The stairs creaked.</p><p>Dean glanced up and saw an old woman in a long nightgown staring at him.</p><p>“Who are you? Why are you in—what have you done to my husband,” she demanded as she took in the scene below her.</p><p>“FBI,” Dean said quickly, scrambling to produce his ID while keeping his iron short-spear beside his leg out of view before Mrs. Meyerson had a heart attack of her own. “I’m afraid your husband has passed.”</p><p>“No... no,” she said, her eyes wet with brimming tears as she brushed by Dean and bent down to grab her husband’s shoulders. “Phil! Phil, my God, no. Philip! Please, no...” She turned to Dean with an accusatory look. “What happened? Why are you here?”</p><p>“My partner and I are investigating strange incidents in town,” Dean said. “I—I thought your husband could help. I had questions. But... I think he had a heart attack.”</p><p>Dean guessed she heard only about half of what he’d blurted out. She sat beside her deceased husband and rested her head against his chest, crying silent tears.</p><p>Good luck, Sam, Dean thought. Kill this damn thing already.</p><p>When darkness blanketed the warden’s house and extinguished nearby streetlights, Sam slipped around to the back door and picked the lock, allowing enough time for the night hag to settle in and begin feeding. Webb was younger than Meyerson, so she should have time to feed. If Sam acted too soon and the nocnitsa fled, they would be back to square one, not knowing where she’d strike next, with dawn two hours away.</p><p>This was it. All or nothing. Clayton Falls wouldn’t last another night.</p><h2><span id="chapter-33">CHAPTER 33</span><a href="#chapter-33" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the western outskirts of town, inside the Falls Federal Prison compound, the walls of the supermax wing began to tremble. Fissures appeared in the concrete and raced upward, forking and spreading in all directions. Large chunks of the walls fell away like a calving glacier.</p><p>While the walls crumbled, the electrical systems shorted out, rendering motion detectors and closed-circuit cameras blind. Inside the solitary cells of poured concrete, the prison’s most dangerous inmates took notice. Lights flickered and dimmed. Cell doors creaked in their housings. Cracks spread across the walls of cells that were de facto sensory deprivations chambers, with the exception of narrow window slots that revealed only a slice of sky and nothing more. Supermax inmates spent twenty-three hours of every day alone in these cells, known as “special housing units” or “SHU.” They were granted one hour per day to exercise, alone, in what amounted to an empty swimming pool. When the walls began to crack, some of the inmates imagined that the heavy concrete slabs would crush them, unlamented victims of a natural disaster.</p><p>But all of them considered the possibility of escape.</p><p>Ragnar Bartch jumped up from his bunk and watched in awe as two long cracks rose from opposite sides of the wall across from his cell door and formed an inverted V. Walking forward, he pressed his hands to the block of stone and marveled as the section scraped and slid away, opening a gap in the previously impenetrable wall. A gleam of reflected starlight on his bunk caught his attention. When he saw the familiar rectangular shape lying there, beckoning to him, he smiled for the first time since he’d come to Falls Federal. He grabbed the handle of the shiny new meat cleaver and ran through the breached wall, eager to claim the destiny that had been granted him.</p><p>Jasper Dearborn, Deputy Warden in charge of security at Falls Federal ran his hand through his thinning gray hair, convinced he was a cursed man. Alden Webb, his boss, had placed Dearborn in charge after leaving early for the day. Said he felt “wiped out.” Thought he might be coming down with a nasty virus or something. Surely Dearborn could handle things for a day or two. Most days passed without incident. Dealing with administrative red tape was the biggest headache. But routine led to complacency. And Dearborn never accepted complacency in himself or others. The previous night’s false report of an escaped inmate had even provided a bit of a wake-up call for his staff.</p><p>Dearborn’s internal alert level went up a notch when he’d received reports of a tornado touching down a few miles from the prison. But that was nothing compared to the report Ray Strawder, his security operations director brought him a few hours ago. Somehow, Kurt Machalek, one of their most notorious supermax cons, had managed to thoroughly and completely disembowel himself while under closedcircuit camera surveillance. Corporal Urbino, the guard monitoring the feeds, noticed static on the monitor. By the time he thought to report it, the image cleared and Machalek was lying in blood-strewn pieces all over his cell.</p><p>Dearborn thought it unlikely a man could commit an act of such grievous violence on himself. The logical conclusion was that he’d had help. No prisoners had access to that cell. Only Dearborn’s men. He was determined to find whoever had decided to mete out his own idea of justice—a brutal execution. And if there was a conspiracy in Dearborn’s ranks, he wanted to root it out before he told Webb of his failure. The situation was contained. Urbino had been relieved of duty and awaited interrogation. Dearborn planned to interview anyone who had access to the supermax wing, and anyone who could not account for his time. Even if it took all night.</p><p>Lost in thought, Dearborn stared at his desk when it began to vibrate beneath his hands. Picking up the phone, he called Ray Strawder.</p><p>“Strawder, what the hell—?”</p><p>“The supermax wing, boss,” his security operations director said. “It’s crumbling.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“The walls are literally falling apart!”</p><p>“How? Earthquake?”</p><p>“Only supermax is affected. All electronic surveillance is down. We’re blind, but I’m getting reports some of the prisoners are outside the walls. I’ve sent men and guard dogs out—hold on a minute.”</p><p>Strawder must have cupped the receiver. Dearborn heard rushed and maddeningly muddled conversation before Strawder came back on the line.</p><p>“Boss, the prisoners are armed!”</p><p>“How the hell is that possible!”</p><p>“Don’t know, boss,” Strawder said, his voice piano-wire taut. “We’re taking casualties. Bartch is out, with a damn cleaver. Killed two guards.”</p><p>Dearborn almost dropped the phone. His hands were numb.</p><p>“Gets worse, boss,” Strawder said. “Stun fences are offline. Tower guards are reporting physical gaps in the fences. Boss, this is some kind of coordinated mass escape.”</p><p>“This is a nightmare, Strawder,” Dearborn said. “Have the tower guards shoot them all. Shoot to kill. Nobody escapes!”</p><p>Not on my watch, Dearborn thought. I won’t let this happen.</p><p>He needed to alert the Clayton Falls police chief, but first he had no choice. Time to notify his boss that everything had gone to hell while the old man caught the sniffles. With a heavy sigh, he picked up the phone and dialed Webb’s number—</p><p>—but the call wouldn’t go through.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Ragnar Bartch sprinted across the prison yard in a state of pure exhilaration. Ignoring the blaring sirens and the blinding watchtower spotlights that swept back and forth, he swung his bloodied cleaver with lethal accuracy at anyone who came within arm’s reach, whether fellow inmate or prison guard. He’d even decapitated one of the German shepherds they’d sent after him without suffering a bite or a single scratch. Handgun bullets whizzed by his ears. Rifle bullets rained down from the watchtowers.</p><p>Two cons running on either side of him dropped seconds apart, but he continued unscathed. Once he spotted the gap in the inner fence, he embraced his destiny. Freedom. Through the opening in the first barrier, he hardly had to alter his course to duck through the gap in the second fence. With fresh blood dripping from his cleaver, the night welcomed him and the lights of the town beckoned.</p><p>Alden Webb, warden of Falls Federal Prison, thrashed in his sleep, unable to wake up from his worst nightmare. Crouched on his chest, elongated fingers of both hands wrapped around his damp forehead, the solidified darkness of the nocnitsa hissed and sighed with delight as she drained the life energy from his body, mining his nightmare for images of fear and darkness to unleash upon the hapless town. She had grown too strong for the man to free himself from her feeding. She ravaged his subconscious mind with limitless abandon. She would ride out his feeble psychic resistance until his body and his mind succumbed to her will. Only when he had been reduced to a lifeless husk would she move on. No need for half measures now. With total focus, she slowly snuffed him out...</p><p>Sam had one shot at ridding the world of the night hag.</p><p>When he slipped into Alden Webb’s bedroom, the man was convulsing on his bed, the predatory monster crouched on his chest, cupping his head in her inhuman hands. Between the warden’s thrashing and the nocnitsa’s discordant hissing, Sam’s approach was masked, allowing him to reach striking distance.</p><p>Without hesitation, Sam thrust the iron short-spear forward in a two-handed grip, the point directed at the center of the night hag’s back—</p><p>—the same moment Webb’s heart gave out and he fell still.</p><p>Perhaps the creature heard Sam’s short exhalation as he struck.</p><p>Whatever gave him away, she spun toward him and the blow pierced her left arm instead of her back. The arm shriveled up instantly and withered away. The night hag shrieked and bounded toward Sam with remarkable speed, knocking him on his back, the short-spear clattering on the floor just out of reach.</p><p>Pushing himself back on his heels, he caught the shortspear in his hand—and froze as the night hag landed on his chest. She lashed out with her remaining hand and the solidified darkness of her fingers reached out to his forehead and through his skull, probing his mind.</p><p>Sam stared at the dark face with its glowing red eyes, long crooked nose, and wide mouth filled with sharp, obsidian teeth, and he couldn’t move a muscle. She’d forced him into a state of sleep paralysis. While his mind was aware and his consciousness raged, he couldn’t lift a finger against her.</p><p>“Ahh...” she said, sighing. “Enough fear, guilt, and darkness in you to feed me for weeks and weeks. Hmm... what you fear is... yourself! And... for him. Brother. Shall we see what happens? Yesss...”</p><p>No!</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Dean called in Meyerson’s death and finally managed to slip outside, leaving the man’s widow to her grief. Win or lose, Sam would be under radio silence until it was over. Lucy and Wieczorek hadn’t heard a peep yet. He started across the brick patio then stopped abruptly when he saw his brother climbing up the handful of steps toward him—holding a butcher knife instead of the makeshift wrought-iron short-spear.</p><p>“Sam? What’s going on?”</p><p>“It’s time, Dean,” Sam said, a cold glint in his eyes as he turned the knife blade back and forth in his hand.</p><p>“What the hell are you talking about, Sammy? Is nightmare bitch dead or what?”</p><p>“Of course you failed to kill her.”</p><p>“She was gone already. You got the memo.”</p><p>“I told him you were useless.”</p><p>“Told who? What the...?” Dean froze as comprehension dawned. “Oh, I get it. You’re not him. You’re his nightmare.”</p><p>“The best version of him.”</p><p>“In your dreams, pal.”</p><p>“No. In your nightmare.”</p><p>Soulless Sam charged, swinging the butcher knife in an arc at Dean’s throat. Ducking beneath the blade, Dean swept Soulless Sam’s legs. The doppelganger crashed into a deck chair and knocked over an old three-legged barbecue grill.</p><p>Shaking off the effects of the impact, Soulless Sam rose up and moved toward Dean, his cold eyes filled with murderous cunning. But Dean had a bigger concern. If he was experiencing Sam’s living nightmare, his brother was in real trouble.</p><p>He had to end this now.</p><p>Though Sam couldn’t move, he was somehow aware that Soulless Sam had been unleashed upon Dean, as if he were seeing ghost images of their battle on his retinas. Sam’s nightmare was twofold. First, that he would lose his soul again, and that Soulless Sam would cause Dean’s death. As he lay helpless on the warden’s bedroom floor, that nightmare was happening. Unable to intervene in the deadly fight, Sam could only wait, paralyzed, while the night hag fed on him until all that remained was a lifeless husk.</p><p>He had an effective weapon within reach but couldn’t use it. The only time he’d had the advantage against the nocnitsa was when she was feeding, when she became focused on nothing but the darkness she craved.</p><p>There was nothing Sam could do against her.</p><p>So that’s what he did. Nothing.</p><p>Though he couldn’t move, his body was taut with the need to fight at any cost. He let go of the tension, let it all slip away.</p><p>Why fight? She’s too powerful. She’s in complete control. Can’t win. Might as well surrender. Give up and it will be over soon. Won’t have to face Dean. Won’t have to face our failure. There’s no hope...</p><p>The night hag noticed his change in demeanor. She leaned forward, nostrils flaring, red eyes glowing with more intensity.</p><p>“That’s it... give it to me... your despair...” she hissed.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes, blocking her victory from his view.</p><p>She might have won, but he didn’t have to watch. All he had to do was give up...</p><p>He was utterly still, unresisting, wearing his hopelessness front and center, giving her exactly what she craved. When she began to rock back and forth and make that discordant hissing sound, Sam allowed himself the briefest of smiles—</p><p>—and slammed the point of the iron short-spear through her chest.</p><p>The nocnitsa shrieked and thrashed as the iron burned through the congealed darkness of her being. Sam sprang up and maintained his grip on the spear, twisting it and redirecting it into the center of her shriveling mass as she tried to recede from it.</p><p>With a blast of foul-smelling air, her body burst apart in rapidly thinning tendrils of darkness that flared and burned into bitter ash and then... faded away.</p><p>Sam stood, panting, and finally let the iron weapon slip from his fingers.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Breathing harshly, Dean stood over the corner of the brick patio where Soulless Sam had fallen. Where he had disappeared a moment ago. Raising the iron short-spear, he looked along its length. Of course, the blood had disappeared as well. Noticing movement near the patio door, he looked across the brick patio and saw the pale face of Meyerson’s widow staring at him through the window.</p><p>Had she seen the whole fight? Or just the killing blow?</p><p>Before the body disappeared, had she judged him?</p><p>Perception is reality. That’s what Sam had said.</p><p>“You’re wrong, Sam,” Dean said, staring down at the previously blood-stained corner of the patio. “That wasn’t you. Never was.”</p><p>Next to a fallen deck chair, Dean’s two-way radio squawked.</p><p>Sam’s voice. “Dean. It’s over.”</p><p>Dean scooped up the radio. “Never a doubt.”</p><p>“I had a few,” Sam replied. “On purpose.”</p><p>Dean frowned but before he could reply, Lucy Quinn’s excited voice came through the speaker.</p><p>“They’re gone! All the nightmares. We’re watching through the binoculars and they’re all winking out!”</p><p>Discretion being the better part of valor, Chief Quinn had already received the first of his rabies shots at County General and had three more deep intramuscular injections to look forward to over the next fourteen days. Harder to accept was Lucy’s assertion—not to mention half his department’s conviction—that nightmares were coming to life. But... the wolf that attacked him had disappeared. And he had seen other things too extraordinary to ignore. He was willing to admit that something strange was happening in Clayton Falls, whether it was a terrorist plot involving hallucinogens, some other kind of biohazard agent or even genetically engineered... creatures.</p><p>The latest news was a prison break. But this time Dearborn, the deputy warden confirmed it, though the man had seemed a bit unhinged when Quinn talked to him. And Webb wasn’t answering his damn phone. Maybe they’d put something in the water supply. Whoever they were. Chief Quinn had no answers.</p><p>Driving his cruiser down Bell Street, he couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw a large man in pale-blue prison clothes running down the middle of the street holding a bloody meat cleaver aloft and yelling maniacally. Stopping the cruiser and turning on his light bar, Quinn stepped out and stared at the approaching man.</p><p>“No. Not this again,” he said.</p><p>“You can’t stop me! I’m invincible! It’s my destiny to kill!” the man yelled.</p><p>Whatever it was, pretending to be Bartch, Quinn had had enough.</p><p>He yanked out his firearm and put a bullet through its forehead.</p><p>The body fell to the asphalt with a convincing thud.</p><p>The bloodied cleaver spun out of the dead man’s hand and skidded to a stop at Quinn’s feet. He waited expectantly. But neither the corpse, nor the cleaver disappeared.</p><p>“I’ll be damned.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>While Dean picked up Lucy Quinn and Jozef Wieczorek at the municipal building and Sam at Alden Webb’s house and brought them all to the diner, C.J.’s had cleared out, at least temporarily. The long night was over and the eastern sky had already begun to pale, drawing open the curtain on the majestic mountains to the west. Soon the breakfast rush would arrive. The Winchesters hoped to be long gone by then. Fewer questions to answer once the dust settled.</p><p>On her way home after an unexpected double shift, Betsy, their amiable server, handed the brothers two paper bags and two large cups of coffee.</p><p>“Cheeseburger and fries, grilled chicken, and a salad for the road,” she said pleasantly. “On the house.”</p><p>Baumbach had caught a ride with another State Patrol cop, leaving Jeffries alone at the diner with Lucy and Wieczorek to say goodbye.</p><p>Dean nodded toward Wieczorek. “Back to your regularly scheduled nightmares?”</p><p>Wieczorek shrugged. “Good question. I don’t know if I still have the Dr. Gruesome gig anymore. Frankly, I’m not sure I want it. May have lost my taste for nightmares.”</p><p>“People need a nightmare now and then,” Dean said. Off their confused looks, he quickly added, “The old-fashioned kind! Helps them appreciate the good stuff in their lives.”</p><p>“So, I want to thank you for saving my life,” Lucy said. “Not to mention half the town.” She stepped forward and gave Dean and then Sam a quick hug. “So, thanks!”</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Dean said.</p><p>“Couldn’t have done it without your help,” Sam said, thinking about the friends Lucy had lost and the people he and Dean had failed to save. They knew they couldn’t save everyone, but the losses were no easier to accept.</p><p>Jeffries hooked his thumb in his bulky cop’s belt and shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“You two are unlike any FBI agents I’ve ever met.”</p><p>“You’ve met a lot?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Well, no, not personally, but I’ve heard stories.”</p><p>“We’re specialists,” Sam said. “Not too many like us.”</p><p>“I believe it,” Jeffries said, chuckling.</p><p>“What about the prison? All escapees rounded up?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Only Bartch made it out of the compound,” Jeffries said. “And Chief Quinn took care of him. Five killed in the escape attempt, seven others rounded up. Supermax wing’s a mess. Survivors will be transferred while the place is repaired.”</p><p>“If it’s repaired,” Lucy said. “The protestors will have a new rallying cry. ‘No more supermax.’”</p><p>“You know,” Jeffries said, scratching his jaw. “Chief Quinn will be a bit... livid you guys left before a final debrief. Guess I’ll tell him I missed you on your way out of town. Assuming Lucy and Doc Gruesome here back me up.”</p><p>Lucy punched his arm playfully.</p><p>“You mean they left already, Rich? Darn, I was so hoping to say goodbye.”</p><p>Wieczorek smiled. “Real shame. All three of us missed them.”</p><p>“Guess that’s our cue,” Dean said. “You ready, Agent Shaw?”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>They climbed into the Impala with their bags and coffee cups and acknowledged the waves from the three townspeople as Dean steered the car out of the diner’s parking lot.</p><p>When they were on I-80 East, Dean said. “Next town, getting the Impala fixed and first motel, I’m sleeping twentyfour hours straight.”</p><p>“Not worried about nightmares?”</p><p>“Used them all up for a while.”</p><p>Sam stared through the windshield, unsure what to expect the next time he laid his head down on a pillow and his subconscious took control. He was aware of Dean’s gaze now and then as the miles rolled by, but said nothing.</p><p>Eventually, he had to ask. “What happened with him?” Sam said. “Soulless Sam, I mean. The night hag let me see it. The beginning, anyway. When he appeared and you realized he wasn’t me.”</p><p>“You didn’t see the whole fight?”</p><p>“Just when he attacked you,” Sam said. “What happened?”</p><p>Dean stared through the windshield, giving more attention to the minimal traffic than strictly necessary. Sam thought he saw his brother frown briefly. Maybe from the sun glare.</p><p>“Like the other nightmares,” Dean said at last. “He disappeared.”</p><p>“Oh.”</p><p>“That’s all it was, Sam. A nightmare,” Dean said. “Soulless Sam ain’t coming back.”</p><p>“I know, Dean,” Sam said. “Nightmares only make sense while we’re having them.”</p><p>When we wake from a nightmare, we recognize how irrational it was. But Soulless Sam had been more than a nightmare. And Sam’s soul had experienced a living nightmare of its own. Who knows what kind of damage that causes, what scars it leaves behind? Maybe you can never go back to who you were.</p><p>Dean switched on the Impala’s radio and found a classic rock station. The Stones were playing “Paint It Black.”</p><p><strong>THE END</strong></p><h2><span id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><a href="#acknowledgments" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Thanks to William Nottingham for advice and suggestions on police procedure.

He was in no hurry. This shelter had been built for the very purpose of shielding travelers from rainstorms. The repetitive rhythm of the rain pelting the roof gave him a focus for his meditations.</p><p>Yet such focus had been difficult to achieve of late. Even now, emptying his mind proved nigh on impossible.</p><p>Once, a samurai such as Nakadai would have committed seppuku—ritual suicide—when his master’s holdings were seized, his lands taken, his title stricken. But such days were in the past. No one knew the ways of honor anymore, and the code of bushi had become a story told to children around the fire, rather than the way of life it was meant to be.</p><p>Now Nakadai was just another of the many lordless ronin who wandered the countryside in the hope of using his skills to survive. During the year that had turned since his master had fallen out of favor with Edo, he had worked as a sword for hire protecting people and caravans, and had taken work as an investigator, an arbitrator settling a dispute between two merchants, a builder, and a teacher showing a rich man’s son how to defend himself.</p><p>His reputation had served him well, particularly in the towns nearer to Edo. Unlike so many ronin, Nakadai always acted honorably.</p><p>He knew no other way. Besides, if a person hired him and he did his job properly and well, they were more likely to hire him again.</p><p>However, while Nakadai was able to acquire enough coin with which to live, he was unable to obtain the contentment he longed for. Had he actually committed seppuku, as tradition demanded, he might well have found peace. But to die out of loyalty to a dishonorable man?</p><p>Nakadai felt no great love for the shogunate, but in this instance, they had been right to censure his master, who had proven himself a coward and a thief. The dishonor was his master’s, not Nakadai’s.</p><p>There was no reason to die for the likes of him.</p><p>Yet honor demanded that he do so. He’d pledged fealty, and the fact that his master did not deserve such loyalty didn’t change the fact that Nakadai had so sworn.</p><p>That conundrum continued to plague him. His mind refused to empty.</p><p>The rhythm of the rain was suddenly broken by the rapid sound of feet squelching in the mud.</p><p>Nakadai opened his eyes and peered into the obscuring rain. He saw a short man running toward the shelter. As soon as the man arrived he futilely tried to wipe the water off his face and brush it from his clothes. Finally surrendering to his sodden state, the newcomer laughed and spoke.</p><p>“Greetings, I hope you don’t mind if I share the shelter with you.”</p><p>“Of course not,” Nakadai replied quietly. Then he closed his eyes once again, hoping the man would understand that he wished not to be disturbed.</p><p>However, such understanding was not forthcoming.</p><p>“I honestly thought this rain would have passed by now,” the man continued, peering out from under the roof’s edge. “I figured to myself, ‘Cho, you just have another hour to go before you reach town, you can make it before the rain gets too bad.’ Instead, the downpour just got worse!” Turning back to his companion, the man named Cho studied him more closely.</p><p>“Hey, you look familiar.”</p><p>Nakadai sighed and opened his eyes. Clearly, he would not achieve a proper meditative state with this Cho person present. Not that he had been in any danger of doing so without him, either.</p><p>Rising to his feet, he started to walk the perimeter of the shelter in order to restore full feeling to his legs. The space was so small that he had to step around the newcomer more than once.</p><p>“You heading into town, too?” the man asked, following Nakadai with his gaze. “I’m guessing you’re a ronin, aren’t you?” Then he shook his head. “Okay, it wasn’t a great guess, ‘cause you’ve got a nice-looking katana and you seem like you could kill me just by looking at me. But those clothes have seen better decades, if you don’t mind me saying. You hoping to find work?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Nakadai continued his perambulations around the shelter, never making eye contact, and looking to the skies from time to time to see if there was a sign that the storm would break.</p><p>Despite his most fervent wishes, his companion continued.</p><p>“You know, you really do look familiar. I’m a messenger, see, and I get around a lot. Would’ve loved to have been a samurai or even a ronin, but you should see me with a sword. Or I guess you shouldn’t, because I’m very bad at it. Still have the scar, actually.”</p><p>Finally, Nakadai turned his head to look at Cho, and he had to admit to himself that he was less than impressed. The messenger possessed muscular legs, as might be expected from one of his profession, but he also had huge eyebrows, unfortunate teeth, flabby arms, and his clothes hung sloppily about his torso. The latter, at least, could be attributed to the storm. But the rest.…</p><p>One of those flabby arms, the left one, had a lengthy scar running from the elbow to the wrist.</p><p>“Pretty sad, huh? But I could always move fast, so I became a runner. Soon enough, folks were hiring me to carry messages. It’s good—I get to travel to other towns and meet lots of people.</p><p>“You know, I’m just sure that I know you from somewhere,” he insisted again.</p><p>Nakadai turned away. The scar was old and healed, and also rather straight. It probably came from an accident— tripping while holding the sword, perhaps, with the edge slicing into his arm on the way to the ground.</p><p>“That’s it!” Cho exclaimed, pointing in his direction. “You’re Doragon Kokoro, aren’t you?”</p><p>Nakadai winced.</p><p>“I am called Yoshio Nakadai.” He had never liked that nickname. The samurai had singlehandedly killed seven bandits who attacked his master’s caravan while they were on the way to Edo for an audience with the shogun. The bandits had been unskilled, and also drunk, so they could easily have been dispatched by a poorly trained monkey, but his master observed the quantity rather than the quality, and lionized Nakadai’s defense against so many foes. When they arrived in Edo, he referred to Nakadai as having the heart of a dragon, and the nickname of Doragon Kokoro had stayed with him ever since.</p><p>Cho shook his head and grinned unevenly, then bowed formally.</p><p>“It is an honor to meet you.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Nakadai said out of politeness. If Cho was honored, then so be it. He stared out at the sky to find that the downpour was lighter and the horizon was turning blue. “The rain will end soon,” he observed.</p><p>“Excellent,” Cho responded, but then his face fell. “Or, perhaps not. You see, while I normally take pride in my work as a messenger, today I am the bearer of bad tidings.”</p><p>“That is unfortunate,” Nakadai said, but he didn’t press. He had no interest in the private communications of others.</p><p>“Very unfortunate. I have come from the local daimyo with news that will greatly displease the people I represent. You see,” Cho continued, despite Nakadai’s desire to respect the privacy of both the sender and recipient, “there are two maidens whose fates remain undetermined.”</p><p>Nakadai turned to face the messenger.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“A man named Kimota promised his son to two different women. The fathers of both maidens paid the bride-price. Before the deception was discovered, however, Kimota took ill and died.”</p><p>“Why did the son not simply repay one of the fathers?” Nakadai asked. “Or both, and choose another woman as his wife?”</p><p>“Unfortunately, Kimota engaged in his duplicity in order to pay off gambling debts,” Cho explained. “The money is long gone, and the poor young man is under obligation to two women.”</p><p>“It is a difficult problem,” Nakadai agreed, shaking his head. “I assume you were sent to the daimyo to receive judgment.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Cho said with a sigh, “but the daimyo has refused to judge on the matter, deeming it beneath his notice to settle the disputes of gamblers.”</p><p>Nakadai rubbed his chin. The patter of the rain lessened, and within a minute or two it would be light enough to allow them to continue on their separate journeys.</p><p>Then he spoke.</p><p>“I have at times,” he said slowly, “acted as an arbitrator in just such disputes, ones that were too sensitive—or too meager—to cause the daimyo to intervene. Perhaps I may be of assistance.”</p><p>Cho brightened at the idea.</p><p>“Perhaps,” he said. “Both maidens’ fathers had rather expected that the daimyo would solve all their problems.”</p><p>Nakadai allowed himself a small smile.</p><p>“In my experience, it is rare for a daimyo to solve any problem that is not his own.”</p><p>Cho laughed loudly at that.</p><p>“Very true,” he agreed, then he straightened and looked directly at the fallen samurai. “We would be honored to have the Heart of the Dragon serve as mediator.”</p><p>Wincing again at the nickname, Nakadai walked out from under the shelter.</p><p>“Shall we, then?” He turned and strode down the road at a brisk pace.</p><p>“Absolutely,” Cho replied enthusiastically, and he ran to catch up and then pass the ronin, until he was leading the way.</p><p>As the messenger passed, Nakadai thought he caught a glimpse of a strange expression on his new companion’s face. A trick of the changing light made the man’s eyes appear pitch black.</p><p>But he quickly dismissed it as a momentary illusion.</p><p>The dispute proved a difficult one for Nakadai to mediate.</p><p>Both women were insistent that they were promised to Kimota’s son—a befuddled youngster named Shiro.</p><p>First he spoke to one of Shiro’s prospective brides, a woman named Keiko.</p><p>“The daimyo is a filthy worm!” she said stridently. “How dare he treat my future as something so horribly unimportant! What kind of a daimyo just leaves us twisting in the wind like that? I tell you, he ought to be hanged! Or at least stripped of his position! He’s almost as bad as Kimota, taking advantage of us like that!</p><p>“You’re a samurai, you should do something about it!”</p><p>Nakadai listened patiently to Keiko’s shrieking, which only got louder as she continued. Then he thanked her and spoke to the other woman, whose name was Akemi.</p><p>Unfortunately, all Akemi did was cry. Nakadai tried asking her questions—something that had been unnecessary with Keiko, who spoke without prompting—but each question received only another sob in reply.</p><p>Next, Nakadai spoke to the fathers. He had been concerned that there would be bitterness between the two men, but their shared misfortune had apparently brought them close together as comrades.</p><p>“Kimota convinced me,” Keiko’s father started, “to keep the engagement a secret until harvest day.”</p><p>Akemi’s father continued.</p><p>“He made the same request of me. It’s been a poor year for crops, you see.”</p><p>“Kimota’s explanation was that the news of an impending marriage would cheer the rest of the townsfolk, after what we knew would be a poor harvest,” Keiko’s father finished.</p><p>Nakadai nodded. He’d wondered how Kimota had managed to keep the twin engagements quiet in so small a town as this, where everyone generally knew the details of everyone else’s affairs.</p><p>Finally, Nakadai spoke to Shiro.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do,” the young man moaned. He was sitting with his head down, staring at his sandals rather than looking up at Nakadai. “Both women are worthy wives, of course, and I would be happy with either of them. I honestly never expected to marry a woman as fine as either Akemi or Keiko. But Father never even told me any of this. The first I heard of either engagement was when Keiko and Akemi’s fathers both came to me after the funeral.”</p><p>Normally when he performed such arbitration, Nakadai’s queries would eventually reveal some critical fact that had remained hidden, and that would point to his best course of action. But in this case, all he could find was what he had learned from Cho at the shelter: Kimota had tricked two men into paying a bride-price for Shiro. Since Shiro could only marry one, he’d be obligated to return the other’s money, which would leave both him and his new bride utterly destitute.</p><p>For the first time since his master had been disgraced, Nakadai found himself uncertain of how to proceed.</p><p>The town boasted a modest inn, and on his third night there, Nakadai sat up late, cleaning his katana by candlelight. The rhythm of wiping the cloth on the curved blade helped him organize his thoughts.</p><p>He heard footsteps moving through the town’s main street. At this hour, most of the populace was asleep, so the steps echoed loudly through the night.</p><p>They also grew closer to the inn.</p><p>Within moments, the swathed shadow of a female figure, cast by a wavering candle, fell across the paper door that led to Nakadai’s room. The shadow’s arm thrust forward, and the door slid open.</p><p>It was Akemi. She fell to her knees.</p><p>“Forgive my intrusion at this late hour, Doragon Kokoro, but I must speak with you.”</p><p>Nakadai gritted his teeth. Cho had introduced him to the townspeople as the Heart of the Dragon, and he was not pleased that the name had taken hold. Nor did he like the idea of people simply entering his room unannounced.</p><p>However, he had yet to actually hear from Akemi, as these were the first words that had come from her mouth while in his presence. So he nodded to her, sheathing his sword.</p><p>She rose, shut the door, then walked toward him, kneeling again in front of him and bowing low.</p><p>“I wish to plead with you to rule for my father.”</p><p>“You were both equally wronged,” he replied. “Why should Keiko suffer and you benefit?”</p><p>Suddenly, Akemi’s eyes changed from pale blue to pitch black.</p><p>“Because, oh mighty Heart of the Dragon, I won’t give you a choice.” As she spoke, her tone became strangely guttural.</p><p>Instantly Nakadai was on his feet with his sword unsheathed. With the transformation of her eyes came an alteration in her face. It morphed into something not quite human.</p><p>“What are you?” he demanded.</p><p>“Originally? Just a demon trying to set the people of this town against one another. For amusement, really. Turning humans against people they trust—now that’s a party.” Akemi’s head shook back and forth. “But these peasants refuse to cooperate! Instead of fighting over who gets to marry that tiresome little rodent Shiro, as I was hoping they would, they whined to the daimyo, begging for assistance.</p><p>“But then I found you.”</p><p>Now Akemi’s face formed an expression that could barely be called a smile.</p><p>“Now I get to do something that’ll provide a lot more than simple entertainment. And you’ll be the one to assist me.”</p><p>Nakadai remained in a defensive posture, but he resisted the urge to launch himself at the intruder.</p><p>“I will never assist a creature such as yourself, demon, if that is what you truly are.”</p><p>“Really? So what happens next?” the demon purred with a voice like gravel. “You attack me? If you do so, then you harm poor, helpless Akemi—and the peasants will condemn you as the murderer of an innocent woman.”</p><p>Nakadai knew that the monster spoke true—yet he could hardly stand defenseless, either.</p><p>So he retained his stance and let the demon speak.</p><p>“You see,” it said with a hint of Akemi’s voice, “one day I will have need of you. Not today, nor even soon, but when the day of this task arrives, it will require the sacrifice of a hero.” The black eyes stared hard at Nakadai. “Do you know how hard it is to find a true hero, especially in these wretched days?</p><p>“By the time I possessed Cho—seeking to pass the time—and pretended to go to the daimyo, I had given up hope of ever again meeting a virtuous man. But then I saw you in the shelter, and I realized I had my hero. Then it was just a matter of luring you here, and that was the easiest thing in the world.”</p><p>“I will not participate in any plan of yours.”</p><p>“Your cooperation is neither required nor necessary,” the thing that controlled Akemi said with a chuckle.</p><p>Before the stunned ronin could react, the demon proceeded to rend Akemi’s garments and slam her head into the inn’s support pillar.</p><p>Then she screamed.</p><p>As she continued to do so, Nakadai’s heart sank, and he realized that there was no defense against this. He knew he had only a few seconds before someone responded to her screams. His only option was to stay and try to explain what had happened. The alternative was to choose the coward’s path and flee.</p><p>Honor would not permit him to run.</p><p>Footsteps clattered in the street, mixing with the woman’s cries to shatter the stillness. The door to the inn was thrown open, and a half-dozen men stared in horror at the sight of Nakadai with his sword drawn, and Akemi, lying naked, bleeding, and writhing on the floor.</p><p>One of the men was Akemi’s father. He called out his daughter’s name and knelt beside her, cradling her wounded head, wiping the blood from her eyes.</p><p>“What did he do to you, my precious daughter?”</p><p>Whimpering, the demon—whose eyes had returned to normal—replied in Akemi’s voice, “I tried to plead with him to rule for our side, and he attacked me!” She lifted her head and glared malevolently at Nakadai. “Said I wasn’t fit to be a bride, and that when he was done, I’d never be!”</p><p>Akemi’s father whirled on him.</p><p>“You dare violate my daughter?”</p><p>Another of the townspeople spoke up.</p><p>“We thought Doragon Kokoro was a man of honor! But you’re just more filthy ronin scum!”</p><p>“I did not touch your daughter,” Nakadai said, knowing it was futile. “She has been possessed by a demon.”</p><p>The voice of Akemi pierced the night air.</p><p>“He’s lying!”</p><p>“Of course he is,” her father said. Then he turned to the men who stood in the doorway. “Seize him!”</p><p>Nakadai could have resisted with the greatest of ease. These were peasants, after all. He could have killed all six of them—and Akemi as well—without difficulty, and made his escape.</p><p>But his katana had never claimed the blood of an innocent. It would not do so now, even if that meant Nakadai’s own death.</p><p>No, he knew then that his fate had been sealed the moment the demon entered his room, wearing Akemi’s skin. Or perhaps it had been sealed the moment he took shelter from the rain.</p><p>So he let the men grab him, take his sword, bind him, and take him to the town square. More townspeople gathered along the way, roused by the hubbub. He was bound to a post and guards were assigned to watch him. But they need not have bothered—he would await the sunrise with dignity.</p><p>At sunrise, the entire town was called to the square to mete out justice. Akemi’s father told everyone what Doragon Kokoro had done to his daughter, and he spat in the dust as he spoke.</p><p>“Will anyone speak in defense of the ronin?” he challenged.</p><p>Nobody spoke.</p><p>Ropes biting into his wrists at his back, Nakadai regarded the crowd that had gathered before him. In their eyes, he saw revulsion at what they thought had been done to Akemi, and disappointment that the Heart of the Dragon was apparently less than his reputation. He longed to speak the truth, but knew it would do no good.</p><p>Akemi’s father turned to look at him. His eyes swam over with black.</p><p>So the demon has found a new vessel, Nakadai mused.</p><p>“It seems that you have been condemned, ronin,” it said, no hint of the guttural in its voice. “You should have sought your pleasures in a whorehouse instead of with my daughter, filth.” He spat again, this time at Nakadai’s feet.</p><p>Of Cho and Akemi, the prisoner saw no sign. He wondered what became of those who had been possessed, after the demon departed. He suspected that it didn’t bear thinking about.</p><p>His eyes returning to normal, Akemi’s father spun to face the crowd.</p><p>“Yoshio Nakadai, the so-called Heart of the Dragon, will be burned to death for his crimes!”</p><p>The crowd cheered their assent, hurling epithets.</p><p>Nakadai was appalled.</p><p>“I demand the right of seppuku!” he cried.</p><p>Turning back, the demon snarled with the voice of Akemi’s father.</p><p>“You have violated my daughter! You are in no position to ‘demand’ anything, ronin scum!”</p><p>Nakadai moved to protest, and then silenced himself. To refuse a proper death for a samurai, even a ronin, was unheard of. But he also knew that any further objection would be fruitless.</p><p>Several of the townspeople pounded a bamboo pole into the ground, well away from their dwellings, while others grabbed him, dragged him over, and tied him there. Some made certain his bindings were firm, while others placed sticks at his feet, piling them up to his knees.</p><p>Akemi’s father left, then reappeared holding a torch.</p><p>The townspeople all backed away.</p><p>“You die today for your crimes, Doragon Kokoro,” the demon shouted, loud enough for all to hear. An amused grin briefly twisted its mouth.</p><p>He bent over to thrust the torch into the sticks. As he did so, he whispered words in a language that Nakadai did not know, and that only the ronin could hear.</p><p>There was a foul purpose here, but as the flames licked his legs and his battered robes caught fire, he could not divine what it was.</p><p>Though the flames burned the living flesh from his bones, the Heart of the Dragon died without screaming, while the population of an entire town cheered his death.</p><p>The demon watched through Akemi’s father’s eyes as Yoshio Nakadai burned. Even as the flames consumed the ronin’s body, a fire of a different kind was consuming his soul.</p><p>The creature was pleased with itself. So many of its kind were concerned with quick fixes—a soul here, some political influence there. Such things were so—so trivial.</p><p>No, it preferred to play for the bigger stakes.</p><p>Not that the small stakes didn’t have their rewards. He looked around at the people of this town, who had been so easily manipulated by Kimota. The demon hadn’t had anything to do with that—in fact, it was Kimota’s manipulations that had drawn its attention to this otherwise insignificant little spot in the first place.</p><p>Such delightful machinations attracted him like a fly to shit.</p><p>But once the demon had realized what was happening, it had decided to have some fun. It had gifted Kimota with a fatal illness, turned the people even more against one another, and then wore the town messenger to guarantee that no help would be forthcoming from the daimyo, thus enraging them further.</p><p>That anger, the outrage—that was fun. But being able to lure a noble soul to the town, that was art. And it was art that would survive long past this delicious moment.</p><p>While it had no idea how long it might take, the demon was fully aware that one day the demons and the angels were going to go to war, that Lucifer’s minions and God’s minions would launch their epic final battle.</p><p>Most demons would be little more than foot soldiers, and they’d be happy with their lot. But this demon had plans. It had managed to escape Hell, thanks to a bored man who possessed an ancient scroll and didn’t value his own soul particularly highly. Since that day it had roamed the Earth, getting ready for the big one.</p><p>It wasn’t sure how long it would take, but being an immortal demon, it could afford to be patient.</p><p>The eldritch flames, summoned through a whispered spell, entwined themselves around the Heart of the Dragon, blackening his purity and his nobility even as the physical flames melted his flesh and muscle and bone.</p><p>When the time came, the spirit of Yoshio Nakadai would become a weapon of unimaginable power in the hands of demonkind: a noble soul put to ignoble use.</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean Winchester stared calmly across the table at the man with the white goatee.</p><p>They were the only two players remaining in an all-night poker game, and Dean had a substantial pile of chips in front of him. White Goatee only had one hundred-dollars’ worth left, and he was contemplating his cards nervously while puffing on his twelfth cigar of the night. That he did so while sitting under the red NO SMOKING sign had been a source of amusement when the game started, but now it was just tiresome.</p><p>Dean doubted he’d ever get the smell of cheap cigar out of his leather jacket, but that was the price he had to pay. Well that and the game’s 600-dollar buy-in, which Dean had been forced to borrow from Bobby Singer. He and his brother Sam had been reduced to an almost penniless state, which meant that they needed a big score in order to keep doing things like eating and putting gas in Dean’s 1967 Chevrolet Impala. After all, starving to death or being stuck on the road without gas were extra inconveniences when you were trying to prevent the Apocalypse.</p><p>White Goatee stared at Dean’s four up cards: a two of hearts, three of clubs, four of hearts, and a six of spades. As for him, he had three aces showing, as well as a four of diamonds. Dean had consistently matched his opponent’s bets, never raising him. He could afford to be magnanimous, given his monster pile of chips and the fact that White Goatee was on his last legs.</p><p>I really ought to learn this guy’s name, Dean mused.</p><p>Then he thought about it.</p><p>Nah. Why bother?</p><p>The problem for White Goatee was that he couldn’t be sure if Dean was betting for the fun of it or not. After all, Dean was able to match all bets, even with a crap hand. His up cards indicated a likely straight, or maybe two pair or three of a kind.</p><p>On the other hand, White Goatee could easily have a full house, or even four aces. Not likely, though, judging from his expression.</p><p>What worried White Goatee, Dean figured, was that his pile of chips had been slowly but surely increasing all night and into the morning. That wasn’t an accident. The other five players had all dropped out, with most of their money now represented by clay disks that were either stacked in front of Dean or in the middle of the table.</p><p>In many ways, he felt ridiculous playing poker when the world was about to end, but they had to get cash somehow. Besides, he felt even more ridiculous thinking so matter-of-factly about the end of the world.</p><p>Yet it was true, and there was no escaping it. Sam had been manipulated by a demon named Ruby into freeing Lucifer from his prison. The angels and the demons were squaring off, and humanity was going to pay the price.</p><p>The angels insisted that Dean was the vessel for the Archangel Michael, while the demons were just as insistent that Sam was destined to become the vessel for Lucifer. They had been told that this was inevitable, and that they should accept their fates.</p><p>Both brothers declined to accept a damned thing. So to speak.</p><p>They had no idea how they were going to triumph, but they also knew that they’d find a way, or go down fighting.</p><p>First things first, though.</p><p>“C’mon, Colonel Sanders,” Dean said, breaking the silence and making everyone in the room jump. “Bet or fold.”</p><p>White Goatee sighed.</p><p>“Ain’t got me no choice, do I?” He pushed all his chips in. “Hunnert.”</p><p>Dean tossed in two fifty-dollar chips.</p><p>“Call.”</p><p>Grinning, White Goatee flipped over the ace of hearts he had in the hole alongside the three he had up.</p><p>“Quads.”</p><p>Letting out a long breath, Dean first flipped over the six of hearts. Then he flipped over the four of hearts.</p><p>Thinking Dean only had two pair—sixes and fours— White Goatee started to make a grab for the chips.</p><p>Then Dean flipped over his third hole card: the five of hearts.</p><p>Which gave him the two, three, four, five, and six of hearts: a straight flush, which was the only hand that could beat four of a kind.</p><p>He grinned like the cat who ate the canary.</p><p>“Oh, hell, no!” White Goatee yelled.</p><p>Behind Dean, three men laughed. One was the bartender, who also ran the game. The other two were the only players who’d stuck around after they had lost all their money, curious to see how the rest of the game would go.</p><p>The bartender could afford to laugh, since one hundred dollars of everyone’s buy-in went straight to him, in return for the use of the hall. Once Dean paid Bobby back, that left him with three grand in his pocket. And as likely as not, Bobby would let him keep the 600.</p><p>Or perhaps not. Bobby hadn’t exactly been in as charitable a mood lately. Being stuck in a wheelchair will do that to you.</p><p>“A pleasure, gentlemen,” Dean said as he pushed his chair back. He stepped over to the bar to collect his winnings, and to reclaim his cell phone.</p><p>Scowling, White Goatee just slumped in his seat.</p><p>“The pleasure’s all yours, boy,” he growled.</p><p>Chuckling, the bartender counted out a stack of bills.</p><p>“Don’t mind Hal, son,” he said when he was done. “He just ain’t used to losin’.”</p><p>“Not surprised,” Dean commented, loud enough for everyone to hear. “He’s good.” Then he broke into a grin again. “But I’m better.”</p><p>The two remaining players both rolled their eyes. One of them spoke up.</p><p>“Come on back next time you’re in town. I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we’d appreciate a rematch.”</p><p>“I’ll bet,” Dean replied cheerfully. Then he headed for the exit, ignoring the daggers that Hal was staring at him from under the cloud of cigar smoke.</p><p>Opening the door, Dean winced as the rising sun caught him right in the eyes. For some reason, he had thought the sun wouldn’t be up for at least another hour yet.</p><p>Walking out into the parking lot, he reached into the pocket of his leather jacket and pulled out his cell phone, turning it back on. There were two messages waiting for him, and he put the phone to his ear to listen.</p><p>One was a how’re-you-doing from Ellen Harvelle, who’d been fanatical about checking in with the Winchesters ever since the mess in River Pass.</p><p>The other was Sam, letting him know that the omen they had thought was manifesting in East Brady, Pennsylvania, had turned out to be just a crazy old person with an arson fetish.</p><p>By the time Dean finished listening to the messages, he had arrived at the Impala, parked between an SUV and a pickup. Putting the phone away, he hopped in and started the car, checked the rearview mirror—</p><p>—and nearly jumped out of his skin at the sight of Castiel’s stubble-covered face and blank expression, suddenly there in the passenger seat.</p><p>“Hello, Dean.”</p><p>“What the hell, Cass?!”</p><p>“Sam and Bobby told me that you were here. Bobby did not wish me to remain in his house.”</p><p>Backing the Impala out of the space, Dean peered over his shoulder.</p><p>“How many times do I have to remind you about personal space, Cass, huh?”</p><p>But despite the moment of panic he’d experienced, Dean found it difficult to be angry with Castiel—an angel who had rebelled against his fellows, convinced that they weren’t truly following the wishes of God.</p><p>The angels had killed Castiel for his actions, but then for no discernable reason, he was resurrected. Cass believed that God had done it; the other angels figured it to be Lucifer’s doing, in an attempt to sow the seeds of discord within the heavenly host.</p><p>Dean didn’t give a crap about any of that—he just wanted the angels and demons gone.</p><p>Cass had become the Winchesters’ friend and ally, and while he had lost some of his abilities—such as healing others—he still had enough angel mojo left to be a big help to Sam and Dean when they needed him.</p><p>“I need you and Sam to go to San Francisco,” Castiel continued without acknowledging Dean’s question, as Dean pulled onto the back road on which the bar sat. “The Heart of the Dragon has risen again.”</p><p>“Uh, okay,” Dean replied as he turned onto the empty road. “And that means what, exactly? There’s gonna be a dragon in San Francisco?”</p><p>“No. But a spirit is returning to this plane—one the demon hordes will be able to use in their war with the angels. There have already been deaths.”</p><p>“Okay, then.” That wasn’t much more than he’d started with.</p><p>“I know it’s a long way, but this is important, Dean.”</p><p>Dean sighed.</p><p>“I have to talk to Sam and Bobby first, Cass.”</p><p>“Sam already knows, he’s been researching all night.”</p><p>“Glad you’re giving us an option,” Dean responded angrily. He squeezed the steering wheel and let out another deep sigh. “All right, all right, let me gas up the Impala and we’ll leave—“</p><p>“I can simply send you there,” Castiel suggested.</p><p>“No,” Dean said emphatically.</p><p>“It’s 1,500 miles from here to San Francisco, Dean. It will take you a day just to drive.…”</p><p>“I’ve told you before, Cass, when you do that, it turns my sphincter inside out.” He felt queasy just at the thought.</p><p>“No, I’ll pass.”</p><p>Castiel shook his head.</p><p>“Very well, then. Sam has been researching the two previous manifestations of the Heart of the Dragon.”</p><p>Dean made a right turn, putting the Singer Salvage Yard in sight. Bobby’s not gonna like seeing Cass here, he thought grimly. And as if the angel had read his mind, he saw Castiel flinch slightly.</p><p>“You okay, Cass?”</p><p>Castiel swallowed and cleared his throat.</p><p>“Bobby is not comfortable with my being in his home. He’s still very... angry about his condition, and my inability to heal him. I don’t think he wants me back there.”</p><p>“Cass, I’m sure he’ll get used to—“</p><p>“I will leave you to it, then,” Castiel interrupted, and then disappeared.</p><p>Suddenly wishing he had something to drink, Dean shook his head and kept driving. One moment Castiel was there, the next he wasn’t. No matter how many times he saw it, he still found it disturbing. No way was he going to actually go through it himself, not unless it was a dire emergency. Getting Dean away from Zachariah—that had qualified.</p><p>This didn’t.</p><p>He pulled into the driveway, parking the Impala next to a junker Bobby had been working on prior to his recent injury, which had gone untouched ever since. It was still an open question as to whether or not he would ever walk again. While it was still possible to run a salvage yard from a wheelchair, Dean knew Bobby wasn’t happy about it.</p><p>Can’t exactly blame him.</p><p>Of course, if the four of them couldn’t stop the world from going down in flames, it wasn’t going to matter a whole helluva lot, either.</p><p>Inside, Sam was sitting at the kitchen table, a steaming mug of coffee next to him. Glancing at the coffeemaker on the counter, Dean saw that a fresh batch had just been made, the pot almost full.</p><p>“Hey,” Sam said, without even looking up from the reams of paper he was going through, all probably fresh from Bobby’s laser printer. “How’d it go?”</p><p>“Well, gas, food, and lodging won’t be a problem for a while,” he replied, stepping over to the counter. “Cass filled me in on the ‘Frisco thing.”</p><p>Nodding, Sam looked up now.</p><p>“Yeah, based on what he told me, I’ve been checking it out. This spirit appeared in December 1969 and again in December 1989.”</p><p>“Every twenty years, huh? So no surprise that it’s back now,” Dean said, grabbing a mug from Bobby’s dry-rack and pouring himself some coffee. “Cass said it wasn’t really a dragon.”</p><p>“Well, I’m not so sure about that,” Sam said, handing over some of the papers. “We’ve got bodies sliced open and burned to a crisp.”</p><p>“Yeah, but dragons?” Dean asked, taking the papers.</p><p>“I mean, c’mon. That’s straight out of a fairy tale.”</p><p>“Dean, you’ve been to Hell, I started the Apocalypse, and we’re supposed to be possessed by an archangel and the devil. Now you’re being skeptical?”</p><p>“Yeah, well.… “ Dean glanced down at the printout at the top of the stack.</p><p>Then he did a double take.</p><p>“Sonofabitch.…”</p><p>Sam frowned.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Dean shoved the printout under his brother’s nose. It was a copy of a December 1969 article from the San Francisco Chronicle, complete with the original photographs. He jabbed a finger at someone in one of the crowd shots.</p><p>“Look at that guy.”</p><p>Sam squinted.</p><p>“I don’t—“ Then he peered closer. “Sorry, I’m not recognizing him.”</p><p>“Oh. No, I guess you wouldn’t.” Dean took the printout back and started to read. The story was about the death of a young couple near the Winterland Ballroom—the site, Dean knew, of some great concerts in the 1960s and ‘70s. And the person he’d pointed at was a bald man with a heavy scowl.</p><p>Dean had seen that face at two junctures in his life. Once was when he was a young child, and pictures of him had adorned the wall of their house in Lawrence, Kansas. Those pictures were lost when the house caught fire during the demon Azazel’s attack in 1983. Dean and Sam’s mother Mary was killed in the process. Sam, who was only six months old at the time, wouldn’t have remembered those photos.</p><p>The second time had come a year ago, when Castiel had sent Dean back in time to 1973 and he’d met Samuel and Deanna Campbell and their daughter Mary; his grandparents and his mother—who, to Dean’s abject shock, were also hunters. The elder Campbells were killed by Azazel in ‘73.</p><p>The bald man was Samuel Campbell—his grandfather. And apparently, on one of the Campbell family hunts, they had gone after the Heart of the Dragon.…</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Moondoggy thought this whole thing was just completely uncool.</p><p>It started out the way it always did: Moondoggy needed money for grass. This wasn’t unusual, since Moondoggy frequently had trouble securing gainful employment, and dealers had trouble giving him grass when he couldn’t pay for it.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to work. Michael James Verlander—who had started calling himself “Moondoggy” after he turned on, tuned in, dropped out, and moved to San Francisco six years earlier—just wasn’t always hip to the whole “taking instructions” scene. It had derailed his career as a roadie. He’d been a good one, too, for the Dead and Ten Years After, and a few others.</p><p>Lately, though, the gigs had been drying up.</p><p>Finding things, though, Moondoggy had always been good at that.</p><p>So when Albert Chao came to him in the bar one night, and told him he was looking for a piece of paper that was part of a spell, Moondoggy was with it. His ex was a waitress at the bar, and Albert was one of the regulars.</p><p>Moondoggy knew some guys who knew some guys who dealt with that kind of spooky stuff. Albert promised some serious bread, and that meant Moondoggy could buy more grass.</p><p>So first he went to the head shop in Haight-Ashbury where Ziggy sold his comic books. Ziggy used to hunt freaky stuff all the time, till he lost his legs. Now he went around on crutches and wrote and drew comic books about a guy who hunted monsters.</p><p>Moondoggy bought one of his comics, and in exchange Ziggy gave him the name of a guy in the Tenderloin. The guy in the Tenderloin passed on another name to Moondoggy in exchange for the comic book, which was handy, since Moondoggy hated Ziggy’s comics and was just going to throw it out anyway.</p><p>That was when he hit the snag.</p><p>The guy in the Tenderloin sent Moondoggy back to the Haight to a chick named Sunflower, who’d been looking to score some really good LSD. Her usual supplier had got himself pinched by the fuzz, and her other pushers had stuff that had been stepped on way too many times.</p><p>That wasn’t the snag. That was the easy part. Moondoggy never bothered with acid—that stuff supposedly broadened your horizons, but he generally preferred to deaden his. But he knew how to get the best LSD in the Bay Area. In exchange for introducing Sunflower to the acid king, Moondoggy could finally score the spell fragment for Albert Chao.</p><p>No, the snag was that he had to go to Dolores Park.</p><p>Moondoggy walked down 25th Street, rubbing his arms against the November cold, approaching an imposing Victorian façade halfway down the block. He was only wearing his bell-bottoms, Birkenstocks, and the tie-dyed shirt his ex had given him as a birthday present before they broke up. He used to have a denim jacket, but it had disappeared at some point. He might even have sold it for some grass. He couldn’t remember.</p><p>The place he was apartment-sitting was in the Inner Mission on Guerrero near 22nd. It was only a ten-minute walk to Dolores Park, but it may as well have been another planet. There were very few people on the street, and the ones he did see were going straight from their fancy sports cars to their front doors. Other people peered at him from behind their lace curtains.</p><p>None of them bothered with the cold. Weather was for peasants.</p><p>Any minute, he just knew someone was gonna call the fuzz.</p><p>His knobby knees wobbling, he walked up the stairs to the Victorian’s front door, which had been painted a sickly green color.</p><p>Knocking on the door, he felt a chill that had nothing to do with the wind coming in off the bay. The door made a hollow sound, like he was banging on someone’s coffin.</p><p>For several seconds, nobody answered. This was all starting to get too heavy for Moondoggy.</p><p>Just as he was about to give up, go back to his pad, and figure out what to tell Albert, someone opened the door a crack. It made a piercingly loud creak, and he winced.</p><p>Someone was standing on the other side, but it was dark in there, and Moondoggy couldn’t make out a face.</p><p>“Uh, how’s it hangin’, man?” he said haltingly. “Sunflower sent me?”</p><p>“Are you Moondoggy?” replied a voice that sounded like crumpled paper.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, that’s me, man. I’m just here to pick up the spell fragment.”</p><p>“Do you understand that what I am about to hand you is not complete?”</p><p>Now he had recovered his nerves, Moondoggy was starting to get cranky.</p><p>“Look, man, I didn’t go to college or nothin’, but I know what the word ‘fragment’ means, okay? I’m just here to pick the thing up, know what I’m sayin’?”</p><p>There was a pause.</p><p>“Wait here,” the crumpled-paper voice said, and then the door shut with a loud slam that ruffled the hairs in Moondoggy’s beard.</p><p>“Coulda at least let me in,” he muttered, rubbing his arms again. “Shoulda made Albert pay me in advance.”</p><p>He wasn’t sure how much time passed—Moondoggy had never owned a watch, which was another reason his roadie career hadn’t lasted all that long—but eventually the green door squealed open again.</p><p>It opened wider this time, so that Moondoggy could see the cat who was standing on the other side. He had skin that was more wrinkled than the elephants at the circus, and wispy white hair in spots on his mostly-bald head. Liver spots covered his crown.</p><p>There were some concert posters on the wall, which surprised Moondoggy. He wouldn’t have thought that cats who dealt in spells would like good music, but there was the poster from when the Dead played at the Fillmore back in February and March.</p><p>Was that this year, or last? He was never good with dates.</p><p>A gnarled hand held out a scrap of paper that was as crumpled as the old man’s voice.</p><p>“Be very wary of this,” the man said. “It is part of a spell that can summon a vile spirit from the very depths of Hell.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Heavy.” Moondoggy took the proffered scrap and looked it over. It looked like a bunch of nonsense. He didn’t know any languages except for English and Spanish, and this didn’t look anything like either one. With a shrug, he shoved the piece of paper into the back pocket of his bell-bottoms.</p><p>“Thanks, man. Hey, were you at that Dead show at the Fillmore? ‘Cause it was—“</p><p>The door slammed again.</p><p>“Guess not.” Turning around, he started down the stairs. With each step, he felt an ever-increasing desire to put as much distance as he could between himself and the gloomy Victorian house.</p><p>So he walked as fast as his legs could carry him back to the Inner Mission. Moondoggy felt more at home here. There were people, and nobody looked twice at him. Best of all, there weren’t creepy old cats with weird voices and spell fragments.</p><p>Finally he arrived home.</p><p>Of course it wasn’t exactly Moondoggy’s home. The pad actually belonged to his friend Freddy, who had gone east for Woodstock back in August. Then he’d decided to stay in New York and become a famous folk musician. Last Moondoggy heard, Freddy had got a gig at Gerde’s Folk City in Greenwich Village. Lots of people got their start at Folk City, Bob Dylan, Arlo Guthrie, Judy Collins, and Doc Watson, so Freddy had figured if they could do it, he could do it.</p><p>Of course, Freddy didn’t even know how to tune his guitar right, so Moondoggy wasn’t holding out much hope. But as long as Freddy was chasing his dream, he had a place to sleep, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>He just hoped that Freddy wouldn’t mind what had happened to that fancy mug of his. Freddy claimed he’d been cutting down on the caffeine anyhow, so he probably wouldn’t even notice.</p><p>He climbed the three flights of rickety stairs up to the apartment, fumbling through the pockets of his bell-bottoms for the keys. His arrangement was handy—Freddy didn’t charge him rent, just asked him to feed Viola Lee, his cat, and that hadn’t been an issue for weeks.</p><p>Reaching his destination, Moondoggy instinctively stretched his hand out towards the doorknob.</p><p>But then the door opened.</p><p>“Far out,” Moondoggy muttered, and a chill ran up his spine, but he quickly calmed his nerves. “Musta forgot to lock it.” It certainly wouldn’t have been the first time. In fact, that was why Viola Lee was no longer his concern.</p><p>Stepping inside, he heard the sounds of Led Zeppelin playing from his—okay, Freddy’s—turntable. That was when Moondoggy knew something was wrong. For one thing, he hated Zeppelin. For another, he’d been gone for a couple of hours now. If he’d left a record on, the needle would be at the end of the side. No way would it still be playing.</p><p>Walking cautiously down the short hallway and into the pad’s tiny living room, he found someone sitting on the couch.</p><p>“Albert?” Moondoggy asked, relief palpable in his voice. “Are you early, man? Not that I’m complainin’ or nothin’.” He vaguely recalled asking his neighbor to look out for Albert. Timing wasn’t one of Moondoggy’s strong points.</p><p>Albert just smiled. He was a young Asian, and if Moondoggy remembered right, he was half Chinese and half Japanese. He had his dark hair in a bowl cut that made him look like an Eastern Paul McCartney—or at least what McCartney looked like back in the day, before he grew the beard—and he had a flat face. The tip of his nose stuck out a bit, which was freaky. Albert wore a white Nehru jacket and black slacks, and looked way too elegant to be hanging out in a dump like this.</p><p>He stood up.</p><p>“I’m working on a timetable, ‘Doggy. You see, this spell functions best on the night of the new moon.” The look on his face said that he expected that to mean something.</p><p>“Far out, man,” Moondoggy answered with a nod. He’d never really paid much attention to the lunar cycle, so he had no idea when the new moon might occur. Digging a hand into his back pocket, he pulled out the scrap of paper the old man had handed him. “Here you go, man. You got my bread?”</p><p>Snatching the crumpled paper from Moondoggy’s hand, Albert peered at it intently.</p><p>“All in good time, ‘Doggy. I have to make sure that these are solid goods.”</p><p>Moondoggy nodded.</p><p>“I can dig that.” There’d been plenty of occasions when he’d bought some grass without checking to make sure it was good, often to his regret. Always best to inspect the merchandise.</p><p>Albert pulled a much more pristine slip of paper out of the pocket of his Nehru jacket. Unfolding the paper, he held it next to the wrinkled one Moondoggy had given him.</p><p>Then he broke into a wide grin.</p><p>There was something wrong in that grin.</p><p>“Excellent.”</p><p>“So can I have my bread now?” Moondoggy asked. He really wanted to get this over with.</p><p>But Albert seemed to have forgotten that he was there. He was chanting something now, and while Moondoggy didn’t recognize the words, he had a creepy feeling they were the strange ones he’d seen on the scrap of paper.</p><p>While he usually prided himself on being pretty laid back, he was beginning to get pissed off. He didn’t like being ignored, and he had important things to do.</p><p>“Hey, man, go cast your spell on your own time. I gotta go score me some grass before I meet up with my old lady, and.…”</p><p>Then the coffee table caught fire.</p><p>“Aw, man!” Moondoggy cried, jumping back. Freddy might not miss the mug, and cats ran away all the time, so he wasn’t sweating that, but the coffee table? That Freddy would notice! He grabbed a blanket and moved to smother the flames.</p><p>But then he froze.</p><p>The coffee table was already burned to a pile of ash, but now Moondoggy could see a figure standing inside the fire. The flickering light of the flames cast odd shadows.</p><p>Albert had a huge grin on his face.</p><p>“Yes! It worked! Finally! It’s even better than I thought!” Then he regarded Moondoggy with a pitying expression. “I must apologize, ‘Doggy. You see, I misled you in the bar last week when I informed you that I would be able to pay you handsomely for the service of providing the rest of the spell.”</p><p>Moondoggy couldn’t take his eyes off the figure inside the fire. The man exuded waves of malevolence, and he was holding something, but he couldn’t figure out what it was. The flames licked higher toward the ceiling.</p><p>As Albert’s words sunk in, with a shudder Moondoggy turned his attention back to his visitor.</p><p>“Whaddaya mean, man?” he said plaintively. “You’re not gonna stiff me, are you?”</p><p>“I mean,” Albert said slowly, “that if I had the money to pay you, I would not require the spell needed to bind the Heart of the Dragon.”</p><p>“The who of the what?” Moondoggy was still enraptured by the fire that kept burning but didn’t move or spread to the rest of the apartment. And by the man inside it. This was as heavy a scene as he’d ever encountered.</p><p>Then the man raised his arms, and Moondoggy saw a curved sword that was also on fire. The man waved the sword back and forth several times, sending the weapon whistling menacingly through the air, the fire sparking and dancing.</p><p>Albert spoke again.</p><p>“And I’m afraid I can’t leave any witnesses to what I’ve done, either.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Samuel Campbell hated Christmas.</p><p>He had nothing against the holiday itself. He didn’t dare, honestly, since every time he brought it up, Deanna would give him one of her looks and then lecture him about the winter solstice. Many cultures celebrate the death and rebirth of the sun, since the sun gave life, and so on, and so forth.</p><p>Samuel understood, truly he did. He understood that it was why Christians celebrated the birth of Jesus Christ at this time of the year. Early Christianity was very good at co-opting pagan and Jewish rituals, all to make conversion more palatable. He had always found it ironic that the early church had been so much better at it than the modern one.</p><p>It didn’t even bother Samuel how commercial the holiday had become, with images of Santa Claus on Coca-Cola cans, and department stores doing their best to separate the people from their money.</p><p>Nor was he terribly annoyed at the fact that every year, it seemed like the ramp-up started earlier and earlier. The calendar had only just turned to December, and already it was beginning—with commercials on the TV announcing special Christmas bargains and sales.</p><p>Even the whole “peace on Earth, good will to Man” notion had been co-opted by the hippies, which left a bad taste in Samuel’s mouth. But still, the sentiment was a good one, if naïve.</p><p>No, what he hated about Christmas was the timing. The monsters just loved the solstices, especially the winter one. Nothing they liked better than to come out at night, after all, and the longest night of the year was fast approaching.</p><p>And nothing liked the darkness more than vampires. Right now, Samuel was crouched in the bushes outside a remote house that stood alone at the end of an unlit cul-de-sac in Big Springs, just off the turnpike. It was colder than a well-digger’s ass out here, but the information they’d got from Father Callapso said that this was where the vampire lived.</p><p>He’d spent the past few days tracking this particular bloodsucker. Most of his victims were girls, primarily teenagers too stupid to say “no” to a man who wanted to bring them home. Of course, in Samuel’s experience, most teenage girls were that dumb, and he thanked the God he didn’t entirely believe in that his fifteen year-old daughter Mary didn’t fit that mold.</p><p>Willful, annoying, disrespectful, yes—Mary was all those things. Samuel had hoped for a dutiful little girl, but she’d already seen too much of the ugliness of the world. When you trained a child practically from birth how to defend herself, how to fire a weapon, how to use a knife, and that not only was the monster in the closet real, but it could and should be shot, hoping for “dutiful” was a waste of time.</p><p>The roar of a car’s engine sounded in the distance and quickly grew closer. Samuel soon saw the vehicle that made the noise: a gussied-up show-off car with fins of the kind that boys used to impress girls. He didn’t know the specifics—all he knew about cars was that they started moving when he stepped on the gas, and stopped when he hit the brakes.</p><p>Most likely Mary would’ve been able to quote chapter and verse, since she’d been spending what spare time she had at an auto mechanic’s shop. Some boy who worked there after school was sniffing around her, and Samuel had been meaning to check him out. He just hadn’t had the time.</p><p>His only consolation was that Mary’s own after-school activities would probably keep her too busy to do anything other than talk. The life of a hunter wasn’t exactly built for romance.</p><p>He’d tried explaining that to her once.</p><p>“But what about you and Mom?” she’d asked defiantly.</p><p>“That’s different,” Samuel had protested weakly.</p><p>“How?” Mary had pressed, and Samuel had given up, knowing he didn’t have an answer.</p><p>The car pulled into the driveway that ran alongside the house. Samuel checked the ground next to him where he’d set the bow and arrows, and the machete. He’d use the arrows to slow the vampire down, and then the machete to cut off his head.</p><p>Cutting the engine of his ostentatious muscle machine, the creature leapt out of the driver’s side and ran around to open the passenger door for his victim. The bloodsucker fit the image nicely: tall, dark, and handsome. He had long sideburns, like most kids these days who weren’t hippies, and wore a blue jacket and tie. Despite himself, Samuel admired his clean-cut approach.</p><p>Most vampires looked a few years out of date— immortals tended to have a wonky time-sense. Like that one who appeared to be about forty, but talked about fighting “Jerry” during “the Great War.” Plenty of World War I vets still called it “the Great War,” but for anyone who’d fought in World War II—as Samuel himself had—it was all about “the Nazis” or “the Krauts.”</p><p>When the vampire opened the door to let the girl out, Samuel heard a familiar-sounding giggle.</p><p>“What a groovy house!” Mary said in a much higher, squeakier voice than was normal for her. Even in the gloom, he could see that her eyes were wide, and her mouth fell open.</p><p>He had to admit to a certain pride at his daughter’s ability to put on a character—pride which was tempered by the fact that he was using his fifteen year-old daughter as bait for a bloodsucker. But that was the job. This vampire liked teenagers, and Samuel had a teenager for a daughter. So she had to be the one who would lure the creature back to his house without endangering any more innocent girls.</p><p>Then he heard the low hum of another engine and turned to see the Campbell family pickup truck moving slowly down the road. There was hardly any moon, and its lights were out, so the truck was nearly invisible. If he hadn’t been expecting it, he might not have seen it himself.</p><p>Even knowing it was there, he couldn’t see the driver, but he knew his wife Deanna was behind the wheel.</p><p>Reaching down into the brush, Samuel picked up the bow and grabbed an arrow. He’d need to break cover in order to aim the bow—if he didn’t stand up straight, he’d never get a good shot off, and with Mary that close, he couldn’t risk it—so he got to his feet, notched the arrow, and pulled the string back.</p><p>The arrow flew free and lodged itself right in the vampire’s back, cutting through his blue jacket and embedding itself in his spine.</p><p>The vampire jerked slightly with the impact.</p><p>“Ouch,” he said calmly, and turned, frowning, to see where the arrow had come from.</p><p>Then he laughed.</p><p>“Ah, I see.” He clapped. “Bravo for your excellent skills, sir, but you’ve made one rather critical error.”</p><p>Samuel scowled. “I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Did you really think this arrow would hurt me?” the vampire continued, grinning.</p><p>“By itself? No.”</p><p>Suddenly, the creature stumbled.</p><p>“What...?”</p><p>“But before I came here,” Samuel said, “I dipped the arrowhead in the blood of a dead man.”</p><p>Hissing, the vampire fell to the ground, and started to roll on the lawn in front of his house. Dead man’s blood was poison to his kind. As he did so, Mary calmly stepped aside, finding a safe vantage point.</p><p>Samuel reached down to pick up the machete.</p><p>He heard the door slam on the pickup truck, and spotted Deanna walking toward the house, gas can in hand. In the dim light of a crescent moon, it looked as if she had grown a tail, but that was just the scabbard for Samuel’s Claymore, dangling from her waist. After Samuel cut off the bloodsucker’s head— which would kill it—they’d burn the body.</p><p>Suddenly, the front door to the house slammed open, the noise of cheap metal crashing against wood paneling and echoing into the night. Samuel glanced over, only to see five people moving onto the front porch, all of them looking very unhappy.</p><p>All five had noticeably pointed incisors.</p><p>“Aw, hell, it’s a nest!” he cried, reaching for the bow and arrow once again.</p><p>Before he could even notch the arrow, one of the vampires was on him, snatching the bow away.</p><p>“I don’t think so, meat,” it snarled.</p><p>The arrow, however, was still clutched in Samuel’s right hand, so he shoved it into the vampire’s belly.</p><p>Snatching the bow back from the now-stunned creature, he grabbed the quiver and slung it onto his shoulder, yanking out another arrow and quickly surveying the situation.</p><p>Two of the vampires were attacking Mary, with the remaining two on Deanna. Both women were fighting back, and the quarters were too close for Samuel to risk a shot.</p><p>Grabbing his machete, he sliced down at the neck of the one he’d stabbed in the belly. It didn’t cut the head clean off, but combined with the paralysis from the dead man’s blood, the wound would keep the creature down. They could always finish him off later.</p><p>He moved in to help Mary, and as he did so one of the vampires grabbed his arm and pulled him close. He could smell gore on its breath, and he recoiled. That gave it the opening it was looking for.</p><p>The vampire moved in to bite him on the neck.</p><p>The report of a gunshot echoed in Samuel’s ears, as Mary fired the .22 calibre pistol that she always carried, just in case. The bullet ripped into the vampire’s knee. It wouldn’t kill it, of course—in fact, a knee wound would heal in short order—but the impact was enough to make the monster stumble.</p><p>Samuel gave her a quick nod, then turned to face the downed monster while Mary spun to deal with the one that was still plaguing her.</p><p>Gripping its knee tightly with its left hand, blood seeping through the wound and staining its fingers, the vampire on the ground looked up and snarled at Samuel.</p><p>“You’ll die slowly for that one, baldy.”</p><p>With astonishing speed, the creature leapt to his feet and took a swing at Samuel with its right hand. Instinctively, Samuel raised the machete to deflect the blow. The blade cut through the vampire’s flesh and struck bone with a sickening squelch.</p><p>While the vampire yanked its arm back in an attempt to free it from the blade, Samuel kicked him in the stomach. The bloodsucker fell backward, and Samuel was forced to let go of the machete’s hilt.</p><p>Snarling, the creature—machete still lodged in his forearm—prepared to leap again, but moving swiftly Samuel once again used a poisoned arrow like a spear and stabbed his attacker in the stomach.</p><p>Then he elbowed the monster in the face—which hurt Samuel’s arm as much as it did the vampire’s glass jaw—and grabbed for the machete hilt, tearing it loose from the vampire’s flesh with a bloody yank. He felt the hot splash of ichor on his face.</p><p>For a few seconds, the vampire flailed, but quickly the dead man’s blood on the arrowhead left him helpless. Samuel beheaded him quickly.</p><p>Wiping his face with his sleeve, Samuel looked around to see how the women were doing.…</p><p>As soon as the five other vampires appeared on the front porch of the house, he saw Deanna drop the gas can. While it hit the pavement with a sharp clank of metal on asphalt, she had reached for the scabbard and pulled out Samuel’s grandfather’s Claymore. Since she was a better swordsman, while he was more skilled with a bow and arrow, he had entrusted the precious weapon to her for that evening’s hunt.</p><p>The provenance of the claidheamh mór had been a subject of great discussion in the Campbell family, due in part to the fact that Grandpa Campbell himself told a different story every time you asked him where the basket-hilt sword had come from. Sometimes it came from a member of the Clan who had fought alongside Bonnie Prince Charlie. Other times it was William Wallace’s sword—a neat trick, since the basket-hilt Claymore hadn’t existed in the fourteenth century. Once, Grandpa Campbell claimed that he himself had used it to help steal the Stone of Scone.</p><p>In fact, pretty much every significant event in Scottish history, Grandpa tried to tie to his sword.</p><p>The only story Samuel actually believed was the one that his grandfather told him on his deathbed, when he bequeathed it to him. By then, Samuel had already learned the truth about the things that go bump in the night. A wraith had literally sucked out the brain of his best friend, and Samuel had narrowly managed to kill it.</p><p>But somehow, Grandpa Campbell knew all about the monsters. As he lay in his four-poster bed, staring at young Samuel as intently as he could with rheumy eyes, the cancer ravaging his stomach and sending him into frequent fits of coughing, he told him about the family claidheamh mór, and how since the 1700s, the sword had been used to slay any number of malevolent creatures.</p><p>“And now,” Grandpa had said to Samuel between coughs, “I want you to slay your own monsters with it.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Deanna pulled the sword out just in time as two vampires attacked her—one from the front, the other from the rear. She thrust the sword upward, impaling the first creature through his rib cage. Hot blood spurted everywhere, and the vampire snarled at her.</p><p>She elbowed the other one in the face—a temporary stopgap. Tightening her grip on the silver basket-hilt of the Claymore, she yanked it out of the first vampire’s chest and used the momentum of that to swing it around at the one that staggered behind her.</p><p>The sword bit into the vampire’s arm, causing more blood to spurt.</p><p>But the first one—unperturbed by the stab wound she had inflicted—grabbed her by her hair. As the roots tugged at her scalp, Deanna struggled to fight the creature off, whilst trying to keep tabs on the second as it stumbled, grasping its bleeding arm.</p><p>Predictably, the first vampire went straight for her neck. However, he only got a mouthful of linen, fooled by her thick, flesh-colored scarf. But she knew that would only delay him for a second—as soon as the surprise wore off, he’d tear into her carotid artery.</p><p>But a second was all Deanna needed.</p><p>She swung again with practiced ease, bringing the sword around in a smooth arc. At such close quarters the Claymore cleaved through the vampire’s neck, even though the angle was awkward.</p><p>The head didn’t quite come off, but it was lolling awkwardly as the vampire collapsed to the ground.</p><p>“You filthy strumpet!” the other one breathed as he wrapped a meaty hand around Deanna’s neck. Breathing became impossible as the vampire’s grip tightened, and Deanna felt her feet lift off the ground.</p><p>“You will pay for what you’ve done!”</p><p>Deanna grabbed frantically at the vampire’s wrist with her free hand, while trying to bring the Claymore around with the other.</p><p>Neither tactic was successful.</p><p>A whistle through the air signaled an arrow; there was a thunk and a jolt as the shaft struck the vampire in his wounded arm. Despite the pain that had to be shooting through its body, it stubbornly maintained its grip on her neck for a few more seconds.</p><p>Deanna was beginning to see spots dancing in front of her eyes, when the creature collapsed to the ground. Finally the grip lessened, and she fell in a heap alongside it, just as she found herself able to suck in precious air again.</p><p>Clambering to her feet, she finished the job of decapitating the first vampire, then beheaded the paralyzed one who had almost killed her.</p><p>Only then did she turn to flash a smile at her husband.</p><p>“Nice shooting.”</p><p>“My pleasure,” Samuel replied. Then he finished using his machete on the vampires who had attacked him and Mary.</p><p>“I think,” Deanna said, “that we need to have a talk with Father Callapso.”</p><p>Mary stared at her.</p><p>“Why? He was the one who led us to this.”</p><p>“His information was wrong,” Samuel explained. “There’s a huge difference between a single bloodsucker and a nest.”</p><p>Deanna hefted the Claymore, unwilling to sheathe it until it had been cleaned. Picking up the gas can with her free hand, she approached her husband and daughter.</p><p>“It’s not like any of our sources are one hundred percent unimpeachable,” she said. “We just need to make sure what he gives us is as reliable as it can be. Still, we’re lucky that the Father passes information to us at all—and that he doesn’t think it’s all insane.”</p><p>Samuel scowled at that.</p><p>“Yeah, well, that exorcism we did for him three years back probably helped. He owes us.”</p><p>Deanna started to reply, then stopped herself and nodded in the direction of the bloody corpses.</p><p>“I really don’t want to start an argument.…”</p><p>Mary let out a dramatic sigh.</p><p>“Oh, come on, Mom—it’s not like I’ve never heard you two fight.”</p><p>“She wasn’t talking about you, Little Miss,” Samuel said. “She meant when we have six vampire corpses we need to dispose of, and a house to burn down so it can’t be used again. Once a nest, always a nest.”</p><p>“Right on,” Mary said emphatically. “Let’s get this over with, so I can wash the blood off me.”</p><p>Deanna reached up to touch her face with the wrist of her sword hand. Sure enough, the sticky sensation of blood was there. For that matter, they were all drenched in it.</p><p>“And Dad?” Mary continued. “I’m fifteen now, so can we please stop with the ‘Little Miss’ thing?”</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Samuel answered with a wry smile. Mary just shot him a dirty look.</p><p>Deanna shook her head and hefted the gas can.</p><p>“Come on, my darlings, let’s get to work.”</p><p>Mary always thought it was kind of corny that the mailbox in front of the house said THE CAMPBELLS on it. It was like something out of the good old days, like when she was a little kid.</p><p>But the old days weren’t really all that good—indeed, not as good as most people thought. What people saw on their televisions was what they believed was real, but Mary had learned the hard way just how much of a fiction life really was.</p><p>The world was changing. Everyone knew that, of course. Thanks to television they all saw what was happening— Woodstock, Kent State, Watts, Vietnam, the Civil Rights Act, the March on Washington, the assassinations of Dr. King and Senator Kennedy, Neil Armstrong on the moon— and no one expected things to stay the same.</p><p>Mary, though, had known just how different things were from when she was eleven years old and watched her parents exorcise a vengeful spirit.</p><p>The moon landing had only been a few months ago. To Mary, it was a wondrous thing. Neither Deanna nor Samuel seemed all that interested, especially since it looked as if there was a shapeshifter on the loose in St. Louis, and they were preparing to take the truck onto the turnpike to check it out.</p><p>“But Dad,” Mary had said back then, “what if we go into space and get away from the monsters?”</p><p>Samuel hadn’t had a good answer to that, so he’d just shrugged and continued his preparations.</p><p>There were times when Mary wondered what it would be like to have a normal life. Most of the time she was happy not to have one, because the only way to live a normal life was to remain ignorant. Sure, she’d be able to go to birthday parties and hang around with her friends and do all the other things teenagers did, but she wouldn’t have known that at any moment a vampire or a shapeshifter or some icky creature might come and kill her.</p><p>No, knowledge was power. She preferred to know what was coming. If that meant fewer dates, then that was fine.</p><p>They drove back from Big Springs after burning the vampires and their house. As soon as they arrived, Mary’s first destination was the bathroom. Her long blonde hair was all sticky with vampire blood, and it was just awful. Besides, if she let her mother or father go first, they’d take forever.</p><p>She peeled off her blouse and dungarees, tossing them into the bathroom hamper. Once they’d all showered, Deanna would put the clothes in the laundry with that special soap that Xin—a fellow hunter—had turned her on to.</p><p>As she stood under the hot water and rubbed baby shampoo into her hair—she’d learned early on that baby shampoo was best at getting out organic stains—she thought about the fact that she’d be following a night of vampire hunting with a day at school and her ignorant classmates.</p><p>There were times when she wished she could have it both ways. Have the normal life and still be a hunter. But she knew that was impossible. Sadly, it left her a bit of an outcast at school, both with her fellow students—who thought she was weird—and the school’s teachers and administrators— who were frustrated by her all-too-frequent absences. Much to their chagrin, parent-teacher conferences didn’t seem to do any good.</p><p>That was probably why she was spending so much time at the mechanic’s place after school, whenever she could. John Winchester worked there. He was a nice boy, and refreshingly normal. But he wasn’t like so many of the other high-school students, who just seemed so stupid. John was always so thoughtful about everything, whether it was homework, the war, politics.…</p><p>Plus he didn’t judge Mary the way the other kids did. He respected her privacy and in a time when women were burning their bras and demanding equal opportunity, he treated her like a person, instead of a girl.</p><p>Of course, there were times when she wanted to be treated like a girl. Despite the hot shower, she shuddered at the thought of what her dad would say if he knew what she was thinking.</p><p>Such thoughts were nothing compared to what some of the girls at school were doing. In fact, some of them really were tossing out their bras, and not shaving their armpits, and doing other far-out things.</p><p>Laughing to herself, she turned the shower off. She’d have gladly stayed under for several more minutes, but that wasn’t fair to her parents, who probably stunk pretty bad by now. Toweling herself off, she found herself giggling that she—who’d just spent her evening being bait for a vampire who’d intended to suck her blood—thought that bra-burning and armpit hair were “far-out.”</p><p>Normally she’d blow-dry her hair, but she decided to let it air-dry so Deanna could get in next. Wrapping herself in a towel, she opened the bathroom door to a burst of cool air.</p><p>Deanna was standing outside, arms folded, foot tapping.</p><p>“About time.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Mary said, even though she’d moved as fast as she could.</p><p>“You’ve got a letter,” Deanna said as she retreated into the bathroom. “I left it on your dresser.”</p><p>“Thanks, Mom,” Mary said as she padded down the hall to her bedroom.</p><p>Closing the door behind her, she slipped the towel off and tossed it onto the floor. It fell into a crumple near the hamper with all the other dirty clothes that always wound up on the floor instead of in the hamper that her mother had wasted her money buying—as she always put it. Mary opened the top drawer of the dresser to pull out some underwear.</p><p>As she did so, she saw the envelope Deanna had left for her.</p><p>It had one of the “Plant for More Beautiful Cities” commemorative six-cent stamps for postage, and a San Francisco postmark. There was no return address, but she didn’t need one, because she recognized the handwriting immediately.</p><p>She tore open the envelope and read both the letter and the San Francisco Chronicle clipping that it came with. Then she threw on a tie-dyed T-shirt and a fresh pair of bell-bottom dungarees over her underwear.</p><p>As soon as she opened the door, she hesitated. Pulling the T-shirt off, she went with a white button-down blouse instead. If she was going to convince her father to go to San Francisco, she needed to do it without wearing what he called “hippie clothes.”</p><p>Deanna, as usual, had showered in record time, and was already toweling off by the time Mary left her room. Dressed in her terrycloth bathrobe, she walked downstairs with Mary. They found Samuel seated at the dining room table looking over the Lawrence Journal-World’s sports section. Unwilling to wait for the women to finish in the bathroom, he had chosen to sponge himself off in the kitchen sink, which meant he was clean, but his shirt and pants were water-stained.</p><p>Mary plunged straight in.</p><p>“There may be a job in San Francisco,” she announced.</p><p>Her father looked up from his paper.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“The letter I got in the mail?” Mary offered the letter and clipping. “It was from—“</p><p>Samuel winced.</p><p>“Do not tell me it was from Yaphet. That crazy hippie is—“</p><p>“—in Florida,” Deanna said. “Remember, he went down there last year?”</p><p>“No, I don’t remember,” Samuel said with a sigh. “I don’t keep track of bad poets.” Then he turned his attention back to Mary. “So who is it from?”</p><p>“Jack Bartow,” she replied. “Remember him?”</p><p>Grimacing, Samuel snatched the letter and clipping out of her hand.</p><p>“Yeah, I remember him.” He looked as if he’d just stepped in something foul.</p><p>“C’mon, Dad, he was cool.”</p><p>Ever the diplomat, Deanna joined in.</p><p>“He was a very skilled observer of the supernatural, Samuel.”</p><p>“And an even more ‘skilled observer’ of our daughter.” Samuel said without looking up.</p><p>The Campbells had been in San Francisco a year earlier, tracking a witch who was working her way west on a mystical killing spree. Bartow—who was only a few years older than Mary, and whose family had also hunted until they were killed by a pack of hellhounds—had helped track the witch down.</p><p>Mary had thought Bartow was incredibly groovy, which of course made Samuel a little crazy. They had a great deal in common, really, but all Samuel cared about was that Jack was a boy who was interested in her.</p><p>Samuel didn’t like anybody anyhow, and he especially didn’t like boys who “sniffed around her,” as he put it. She’d always hated that phrase.</p><p>Deanna went over to stand behind him, and she read the letter and clipping over his shoulder.</p><p>Then she looked up.</p><p>“He thinks it’s a dragon?”</p><p>“There’s no such thing,” Samuel said emphatically.</p><p>“Maybe,” Mary said, “but something killed those people in a way that sure looks like a dragon did it. The corpses were sliced to ribbons and burned to a crisp.”</p><p>Deanna gently took the Chronicle clipping from Samuel’s hand.</p><p>“It says here that the first body—the one in the Inner Mission—was found on the morning of the fourth of November.”</p><p>Mary was confused.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>Samuel scowled again.</p><p>“November third was the last new moon.”</p><p>Abashed, Mary lowered her head.</p><p>“Right. Sorry.” Her parents had trained her to know the phases of the moon. New moons and full moons were always rife with supernatural activity. It was stupid of her to have forgotten.</p><p>“It may just be a spirit that happens to act like a dragon,” Deanna said. “But it doesn’t help that the second and third killings were both in Chinatown.”</p><p>“So will we go?” Mary asked hopefully. She’d enjoyed San Francisco the last time, and she really wanted to see the city again.</p><p>Besides, she had a history test tomorrow that she hadn’t had time to study for, and this was the perfect way to get out of it.</p><p>Samuel looked up at Deanna, who nodded.</p><p>“Fine,” he said, “let’s pack.”</p><p>“I’ll call Marty,” Deanna said, referring to Martin Jankowitz, their travel agent. He was always able to get them quick flights relatively cheaply.</p><p>Mary ran up to her room. Since it was San Francisco, she was definitely packing her tie-dyed shirts, no matter what her father might say.…</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Deanna Campbell had to resist the urge to kick her husband under the table, again.</p><p>She was sitting with Samuel, Mary, and Jack Bartow at an Italian restaurant on Columbus Avenue. Upon their arrival at the airport in San Francisco, Mary had found a pay phone, called Bartow, and set up a time and place to meet and get more information on this supposed dragon. Meanwhile, Samuel and Deanna had waited for the luggage.</p><p>They’d packed two suitcases, one with enough clothes to last them all for a week, and the other with all the supplies and weapons they might need. It took forever for the second suitcase—the one with the clothes—to arrive, and Samuel was close to just abandoning it when it finally was disgorged onto the carousel.</p><p>“Could’ve been worse,” Deanna had whispered to her husband, “it could’ve been the other one that got lost.”</p><p>Samuel just scowled. Both suitcases were too large to fit into the overhead compartments, so they’d had to check them before boarding, which made Samuel nervous. The weapons they’d amassed—pistols, crossbows, shotguns, longbows, machetes, swords—would be prohibitively expensive to replace. Samuel’s dry-cleaning business and Deanna’s occasional substitute teaching work provided them with enough money to pay for Mary’s education and allow them to keep their armory stocked.</p><p>And occasionally buy last-minute plane tickets.</p><p>Yet here were times when the bills threatened to overwhelm them. That was the problem with hunting—it was a calling, not a profession, and callings didn’t feed the bulldog.</p><p>Mary was still on the phone when Deanna and Samuel found her.</p><p>“Look,” she was saying as they approached, “that was my last dime, and I really need to—Oh! Here’s Mom and Dad. I’ll see you soon, okay? Right on, Jack. Bye!”</p><p>“You used all your change?” Deanna asked before Samuel could say anything.</p><p>“Just catching up,” Mary said, then she shot a look at her father. “It’s not like we warned him we were coming.”</p><p>Samuel hadn’t wanted to pay the long-distance charge for a call to California.</p><p>Turning back to Deanna, Mary continued.</p><p>“Anyhow, he’s going to make reservations for six o’clock tonight at a place in North Beach.”</p><p>With that they rented a car and proceeded to their hotel—the Emperor Norton Lodge on Ellis Street in the Tenderloin—to unpack and make sure the weapons were all clean and ready.</p><p>It was Deanna’s idea to take the bus to North Beach— more popularly known as “Little Italy”—so they wouldn’t need to deal with trying to park in that busy neighborhood.</p><p>“But I don’t want to go weaponless,” Samuel had protested.</p><p>“The killings are in Chinatown, Samuel.”</p><p>“It’s not the dragon I’m worried about.”</p><p>Deanna just sighed, and Mary rolled her eyes.</p><p>They weren’t wholly unarmed, of course, but they did leave their firearms at the motel. It wasn’t wise for civilians to wander around a big city armed in these days of civil unrest. The local law tended to take a dim view of people carrying guns, and the last thing the Campbells wanted to do was gain the attention of the San Francisco Police Department.</p><p>On three separate occasions as they walked towards the restaurant, someone with long hair and bare feet tried to give Samuel a flower. It made his scowl so deep that Deanna feared his face would collapse in on itself.</p><p>Bartow was late for dinner, leaving the three of them waiting outside the restaurant. The reservation was in his name, and Samuel refused to wait at the bar with an underaged girl, even though nobody in the restaurant seemed to mind.</p><p>Finally, Bartow limped up the hill of Columbus Avenue, after having come out of the front entrance to the City Lights bookstore. Since the last time they’d seen him, he’d exchanged his plain wooden cane for an ornate walking stick sporting a dragon’s head handle.</p><p>Samuel’s eyes naturally went straight to Bartow’s left foot—or what was left of it. He’d had the injury before they met him last year—when he’d just turned seventeen—and claimed it was an accident due to a poorly maintained handgun. But Samuel was sure the young man had shot himself in the foot deliberately to avoid the draft.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late,” Bartow said. “Ferlinghetti was doing a reading, and it ran over.”</p><p>“Wow, that sounds swell,” Mary said with a smile, but Samuel just looked confused.</p><p>Deanna rode to his rescue.</p><p>“Lawrence Ferlinghetti. He’s a poet, and the owner of that bookstore down the street.”</p><p>That just prompted a grunt, and with nothing more left to be said, they all went into the restaurant.</p><p>Once they were all seated and had ordered drinks, Bartow started asking Mary about school. His brown hair was Brylcreemed into a duck’s ass style, and he had a pencil-thin mustache that was almost black. He was exactly the type of boy Deanna would have swooned over when she was fifteen.</p><p>Before long, the conversation turned to the young girl’s social life, and that was what prompted the kick. As soon as the personal questions began, Samuel’s mood darkened— if such was possible—and he started glaring openly. He was about to interrupt when she let him have it.</p><p>Samuel jumped slightly, and looked at his wife.</p><p>She frowned at him, and her expression said, Let the young people talk. She knew how these things went, and didn’t want to be thrown out of such a nice restaurant.</p><p>He sighed, and held his tongue as long as he could. After a while, as Mary was telling Bartow what a nerd her math teacher was, he glanced at Deanna again, and she nodded.</p><p>“So, Jack,” Samuel said sharply, “what can you tell us about this so-called dragon?”</p><p>Bartow smiled.</p><p>“I’m not the only one calling it that, Sam,” he said.</p><p>Samuel’s face twitched, and Deanna sighed. He hated any diminutive of his name, and it would only serve to make an unpleasant conversation even more so.</p><p>Where are those drinks, she thought, glancing around for the waiter.</p><p>“It’s ‘Samuel,’” Her husband said evenly. But to his credit, he didn’t snap. “Or better still, ‘Mr. Campbell.’”</p><p>“Dad...” Mary started, but Bartow put a hand on her arm.</p><p>“No, it’s all right, Mare,” Bartow said in a suddenly subdued tone. Then he turned back. “I apologize for my disrespect, sir.”</p><p>Samuel looked surprised, not knowing how to react. Deanna smiled into her napkin.</p><p>“Apology accepted,” he muttered.</p><p>Nodding confidently, Bartow reached into his shirt pocket and took out a pack of cigarettes.</p><p>“Anyhow, like I said, folks are referring to whatever it is that’s killed these four folks as ‘the heart of the dragon.’”</p><p>“Four?” Deanna interrupted. “I thought it was three.”</p><p>Placing a cigarette in his mouth, Bartow lit it with a zippo.</p><p>“It was, ma’am, but there was another last night. SFPD’s keeping this one out of the newspapers to avoid a panic, but I got a buddy on the job.” At Samuel’s dubious expression, he added, “I helped my parents exorcise a demon that had taken the guy’s son—sometimes a little Latin goes a long way. And that sort of thing buys a lotta gratitude.”</p><p>Samuel relented a bit.</p><p>“My buddy couldn’t get me the files, but he did provide some details about the victims. The first was named Michael Verlander, but everyone called him ‘Moondoggy.’”</p><p>“A hippie,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Yes, sir. But the place where he was found belongs to a guy named Frederick Gorczyk, whereabouts unknown. The next two were ordinary citizens of Chinatown. One was the manager of a laundry, and the other owned a restaurant. But the victim last night was different—a woman named Marybeth Wenzel, a student at Berkeley.”</p><p>“Do the victims have anything in common?” Samuel asked.</p><p>Bartow shook his head while dragging on his cigarette.</p><p>“At least not that anybody could find. Hard to say for sure, since the Chinese don’t usually talk to cops, so nobody knows much about those two. And this latest victim, the girl? She just makes it even worse. That’s why mum’s the word with the PD on the latest one. A hippie and two Chinese is one thing—they’ll barely get noticed. But this is a nice college girl, and that usually means lots of attention from the fourth estate.”</p><p>Their drinks arrived at that moment. Deanna sipped her 7-Up in annoyance at how right Bartow was. Immigrants and a dropout wouldn’t garner much press attention, but the newspapers would become a lot more interested once word of the girl’s death was made public.</p><p>“Do you really think it’s a dragon?” Mary asked eagerly.</p><p>Bartow shrugged and sipped from his glass of red wine.</p><p>“Dunno, Mare, but word all over Chinatown is whispered talk of ‘the heart of the dragon.’”</p><p>Samuel slugged down some of his beer.</p><p>“All right. You girls hit the books. See if you can find out what this ‘heart of the dragon’ is, and how it might relate. I’ll see if I can track down who summoned it.”</p><p>Bartow sat up straighter in his chair.</p><p>“What do you want me to do, sir?”</p><p>“We can take it from here, son,” Samuel said a little dismissively.</p><p>“Dad,” Mary said with a glare, “that’s not fair. We wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for Jack.”</p><p>Samuel was about to argue, but Deanna cut him off.</p><p>“We can probably use his help on the research end,” she said.</p><p>Her husband tossed her a look of irritation, but she just stared right back. Samuel didn’t like working with other hunters, she knew, but given that Jack had actually called them in on this, it didn’t seem right to cut him off now.</p><p>“The three of us have our own way of doing things,” Samuel said in a tight voice. “I’m sure Jack understands that.”</p><p>Taking a final drag on his cigarette, Bartow stamped it out in the ashtray just as the waitress brought their food. He waited until after she’d placed all four plates in front of them before speaking.</p><p>“Look, I realize I can’t do much with my bum hoof, but I know my way around the public library, and I know this town. I can help.” Then he began cutting his veal parmigiana into neat rectangles with his knife and fork.</p><p>Samuel ignored his own meal and stared at Jack.</p><p>“It’s the bum hoof I’m concerned about, Jack. I’ll be honest with you—I’m not comfortable trusting my back to somebody who shot himself in the foot.”</p><p>Jack’s mouth was full, and Mary—who was twirling her spaghetti pomodoro around her fork—spoke before he could swallow and defend himself.</p><p>“Dad, what’s got into you,” she demanded. “Why are you being such a butthead?”</p><p>“I’m not being a—“</p><p>“He didn’t shoot himself in the foot!”</p><p>“So he says.”</p><p>“And so I say, because last time we were out here he showed me the wound. The angle’s wrong—it couldn’t possibly be self-inflicted.”</p><p>Deanna couldn’t help but smile with pride. She also hoped her husband didn’t pick up on the fact that Mary and Jack had been in such an intimate situation without his knowledge.</p><p>“Why didn’t you mention that before?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“Why didn’t you just trust me?” Mary shot back.</p><p>“Or me?” Jack asked, finally able to get a word in edgewise. “Look, I dig that you don’t like me, Mr. Campbell, but you knew both my parents. And I get the scene, believe me. I can help.”</p><p>Samuel glanced at Deanna, which told her that he felt outnumbered.</p><p>Deanna just dug into her pasta primavera, signaling to him that he was on his own.</p><p>Samuel finally speared his osso bucco with a fork, which prompted her to smile again. He’d never admit to losing the argument, but not trying to claim the last word was usually enough.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Josh Friedrich loved working the overnight shift in the morgue.</p><p>Sure, a lot of people thought that made him a loony, but Josh had long ago stopped caring what other people thought. It made it easier to sleep through the night.</p><p>Or, rather, sleep through the day, since he spent his nights here, in “the frigidaire”—his nickname for the freezer where the bodies were kept—and in the lab doing his thing.</p><p>The best part was that the cops usually didn’t bother him all that much. Josh loved his job as a coroner, but he hated dealing with the police. While they were impossible to avoid completely, they didn’t come to the morgue at night unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>As a result, most of Josh’s reports were either delivered by messenger, or left for someone to pick up during the day.</p><p>Which suited Josh fine. He got to investigate the human body at his leisure, he got to help solve crimes, and he rarely had to talk to the fuzz. Or to reporters.</p><p>Reporters were worse, and every day of his life Josh was thankful he wasn’t part of the Zodiac killer nonsense. Anybody came to him to talk about it, he just said he wasn’t on the case, and ran away.</p><p>One downside to working late was that he had to work on the Sabbath. That didn’t bother Josh all that much, but his mother suffered from serious diarrhea of the mouth whenever the subject came up. To silence her, he either told her that his job was important, or tried to get Friday nights off.</p><p>But he’d never request the day shift. He liked it quiet.</p><p>So it was kind of a drag when the FBI agent showed up. The guy just stormed in like it was his living room or something. Josh knew he was a Fed the minute he walked in the door, just by the way he carried himself. He was bald, so he didn’t have the trademark slicked-back hairdo, but the rest of him just screamed Bureau.</p><p>As soon as he got into the morgue, he put his hands on his hips and stared straight at Josh.</p><p>“You Dr. Friedrich?”</p><p>“Uhm, yessir. What can I—“</p><p>“You’re the coroner on the Wenzel case, right? And the other burnings?”</p><p>Josh blinked. Rude sonuvabitch, isn’t he?</p><p>“Uh, yes—yessir, I am. I didn’t realize this was a federal case.”</p><p>“Why are you surprised at that, exactly, Doctor?” the Fed asked tersely.</p><p>Swallowing nervously, Josh thought for a moment before he replied.</p><p>“Well, uh—to be honest, the fuzz here don’t really like Feds, sir.”</p><p>“Well, we’re not all that fond of them, either.”</p><p>“I don’t blame you,” Josh said quickly. “Anyhow, I’m surprised they called you guys in.”</p><p>“They didn’t—we called ourselves in.” Then he looked around the room. “I need to see the body.”</p><p>“Sure,” Josh said. “Follow me.”</p><p>Josh led the Fed—did he say his name?—back to the frigidaire.</p><p>“Sorry about the cold,” he said, knowing that the fuzz always yammered about the temperature.</p><p>“I’ve been in worse,” the man said with a shrug. He was definitely a cool cat.</p><p>Walking over to the south wall—that was where the most recent cases were kept—Josh went immediately to the metal door behind which lay Marybeth Wenzel’s body.</p><p>He didn’t even need to look at the file to find the right drawer, since he’d been fascinated by this case—or, rather, these cases, since this was the fourth body that had come in like this.</p><p>“I’m glad you guys are here,” Josh admitted. “The fuzz ain’t gonna be with-it on this one, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Pulling back the sheet, he revealed a body that was badly charred and cut up. Josh wondered briefly if the Fed would be a puker, but the guy didn’t even blink.</p><p>“That’s pretty bad,” he said flatly.</p><p>“You said it, brother. We were only able to identify her from dental records. She had great teeth,” he added with a smile that showed his really bad ones. His mother was always bugging him to see a dentist. “Anyhow, she’s got third-degree burns all over her. And that’s the really weird part.”</p><p>The Fed had bent over to peer at the cuts, but looked up at Josh’s last words.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘weird,’ Doctor?”</p><p>“Well, the burns are even, all the way from head to toe. The only way for that to happen is for the body to be completely immersed in fire, all at once. But there’s too much left for it to have been an explosion, so it doesn’t make sense.”</p><p>The Fed raised an eyebrow that made him look just like Mr. Spock on TV.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“Well, she had to have been killed where she was found— the burns made the body too fragile, so if she’d been moved postmortem, there’d be signs, and there aren’t. But the place where she was found? No signs of fire at all. Now, with burns like this, that just isn’t possible.”</p><p>“What’s your theory, then?”</p><p>That threw Josh for a loop. He wasn’t used to law enforcement asking for his opinion—or, rather, hypotheses, since that was all he usually had, even though the fuzz always misused the word “theory” that way. He would often volunteer one, and sometimes they’d even pay attention, but no one had ever asked before.</p><p>He kind of liked it, though he’d have liked it more if he actually had a hypothesis.</p><p>“I don’t know,” he admitted ruefully. “I’m sorry, but— well, I’m at the end of my rope with this one. It’s the same with two of the others—Hsu and Ding have the same burns, with the same lack of any kind of fire at the crime scene. Even with Verlander, the only other damage was to a small table. Isn’t that freaky?”</p><p>“That’s one word for it.” The Fed took another look at the wounds. “Are these animal cuts?”</p><p>Josh barked a laugh, which prompted a withering look. Again, Josh swallowed—this cat knew how to glare and mean it—and he hastily answered.</p><p>“Uh, no, sir, no they aren’t. The cuts are clean and almost—uh, surgical. Looks like they were made with a long blade, like a big knife.”</p><p>“Or a sword?”</p><p>That resulted in another barked laugh—he couldn’t help himself.</p><p>“What, Basil Rathbone killed him? Sorry,” he added quickly, “but who uses a sword anymore?”</p><p>“You’d be surprised,” the Fed replied, his face an expressionless mask. “And you say that the other three are the same?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Can I see Hsu and Ding’s files? And Verlander’s?”</p><p>“Sure.” Josh went back out into the main office and stepped over to the file cabinet. The manila folders were all still in the wire-frame basket on top of the cabinet, since these were “hot” cases. Too soon to stuff them into a drawer.</p><p>The Fed flipped through each folder like he’d been doing it all his life—which, Josh supposed, he had—then just handed them back.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>He’d been trying to be good, but Josh found himself unable to resist asking.</p><p>“Is this another serial killer, like the Zodiac?”</p><p>The Fed just shook his head.</p><p>“I’m not at liberty to say right now, son. And the FBI would appreciate if you kept this meeting to yourself, savvy?”</p><p>Nodding quickly, Josh replied eagerly.</p><p>“Oh, absolutely.” Besides, who was he gonna tell?</p><p>The man took his leave, and Josh smiled. For once he had actually been treated like a person, instead of a loony who played with dead people all night.</p><p>He wondered what kind of job options there were for coroners working with the Feds. And if they had a night-shift available.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>One of the lessons Deanna Campbell tried very hard to instill in her daughter was that a hunter’s best weapon wasn’t a shotgun. Nor was it holy water. It wasn’t even a Claymore that killed a vampire, a demon, or a family of ghouls.</p><p>It was a library card.</p><p>But convincing her fifteen year-old skilled fighter of a daughter of this fact was an uphill battle in itself.</p><p>Early in the morning on their second day in San Francisco, Deanna took Mary with her to the giant white edifice of the San Francisco Public Library. The main branch sat on the corner of Larkin and Grove Streets, part of the city’s Civic Center.</p><p>It was a chilly day, and as they entered the building, there wasn’t much change in the temperature. Walking across the lobby, Mary spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“Mom, you know, we could handle this ourselves—me and Jack, I mean,” she added hastily. “You could go with Dad.”</p><p>“No thanks,” Deanna said. “You know how much I hate acting. Let your father play dress-up—he’s good at it.”</p><p>“I guess,” Mary responded, a hint of disappointment in her voice.</p><p>Samuel had been up late the previous night, posing as an FBI agent, so they had opted to let him sleep in. The visit with the coroner hadn’t yielded a lot of useful information, but once he caught up on his rest, he was going to do what he could with it and try to find a common denominator among the four victims.</p><p>Deanna smiled. She could see right through her daughter—who just wanted to spend time alone with young Mr. Bartow. She couldn’t really blame her, all things considered, but there was no way she was leaving her fifteen year-old unchaperoned with an eighteen year-old boy. Sure he came from a family of hunters, but that didn’t stop them from being teenagers.</p><p>Mary looked down, probably embarrassed at having been so transparent.</p><p>Then she brightened when she saw Bartow waiting for them at the entrance to the research room, leaning on his cane.</p><p>“We ready to go?”</p><p>“Absolutely,” Mary replied, a grin replacing her frown.</p><p>Deanna chuckled, and they made a beeline for the reference desk, where a young woman with long, straight dark hair, a large nose, and a bright smile sat on a tall chair. She was wearing a dark blue sundress and a light blue cardigan sweater.</p><p>“How may I help you?”</p><p>Putting on her brightest smile and over-emphasizing her midwestern accent, Deanna responded.</p><p>“Hi, miss—I sure hope so! We all just had the most swell time in Chinatown, and we wanted to learn more about the people there. Can you recommend some good books for us to read?”</p><p>The librarian nodded briskly.</p><p>“Well, I’ll see what I can do. You see, most of our books on the Oriental culture are in Chinese, and they’re at our Chinatown annex. We have a few books on Chinese culture here, though, and several of them are in English. Is there any particular aspect you have in mind?”</p><p>“It’s funny you should ask that, because everywhere we went, my daughter kept hearing people talking about something called ‘the heart of the dragon,’ and we’re just dying to find out what that might be.”</p><p>“Okay, that gives us a start,” the librarian continued, stepping down from her perch. “Well, the dragon is a very important part of Chinese culture. Let’s see what we’ve got.”</p><p>She took them to a huge cabinet with dozens of narrow drawers—the card catalogue where the titles were filed by subject. She deftly chose specific drawers, labeled in a system of numbers and categories, starting with “180 – Oriental Philosophy,” and within moments she’d turned up several books with historical references to dragons.</p><p>Ancient Chinese secrets, eh? Deanna noted with admiration. This woman really knows her business.</p><p>Several hours of reading later, however—covering every category from “Paranormal Phenomena” to “Paleozoology”— turned up very little that seemed germane to this particular hunt. They found plenty on dragons, but nothing quite matched what the clues seemed to indicate.</p><p>Closing the last of the books the young librarian had brought them, Mary looked up at her mother and Jack.</p><p>“Lots of references to people fricasseed by a big lizard, but nothing that explains the way the bodies were cut up,” she said. “Maybe it’s not a dragon we’re looking for, but somebody who’s been possessed by one. Somebody with a sword?” she offered skeptically.</p><p>Deanna shook her head to clear the cobwebs. Every depiction of dragons they had been able to find showed creatures with claws that were similar to those of an eagle, or a bear—none of them matched the precise cuts Samuel had described.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said. “There’s nothing like that in any of the books I read, but it makes about as much sense as anything else.”</p><p>What was worse was that nothing they found made a single reference to a dragon’s heart, except in the vaguest possible sense. A person with the “heart of a dragon” was said to possess great strength of character—which didn’t exactly fit with running around ‘Frisco cutting people to shreds.</p><p>Deanna closed her own tome with a thump, then she, Mary, and Jack brought their books to the wooden hand truck that rested under a sign marked “returns” in precise block letters.</p><p>“Well, this was a waste of time,” Mary said with a sigh.</p><p>“Hey, c’mon,” Jack protested. “Sometimes knowing what you’re not hunting helps you figure out what you should be.” But even he didn’t look entirely convinced. Nevertheless, Mary clutched at the idea.</p><p>“You think so?” she said.</p><p>Deanna shot the young man a grateful look. She’d been saying the same thing for the last couple of hours, but Mary didn’t want to hear it, coming from her mother. So hearing it from someone closer to her own age helped a lot. It didn’t hurt that the source was a cute young boy.</p><p>The woman in the blue cardigan sweater was gone, and an older lady with dark hair done up in a beehive now sat at the reference desk. She looked to be of Oriental descent and was, in fact, the third librarian to sit back there since they had arrived that morning. Unlike the first, younger librarian who’d helped them, this one was a bit more formally dressed: a white blouse, a gray sweater, and a long maroon skirt.</p><p>“Did you find what you were looking for, ma’am?” the librarian asked.</p><p>“Not everything, I’m afraid,” Deanna said, exaggerating the disappointment in her tone. She almost forgot to put her “Midwestern Mom” voice back on, but caught herself just in time. As she had said to Mary, character acting was Samuel’s scene. Deanna preferred to either read about something, or shoot it.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry,” the librarian said, sounding like she meant it.</p><p>“It’s all right, I suppose,” Deanna replied with a game smile. “We learned bunches about Chinese culture and about dragons, which was really swell. I just wish I knew what all those people meant when they talked about ‘the heart of the dragon.’”</p><p>The librarian frowned.</p><p>“What an interesting subject,” she said curiously. “Are you sure it’s Chinese culture you’re looking for?”</p><p>The question brought Deanna up short.</p><p>“Why do you ask?”</p><p>“Well, although there are many references to dragons in Chinese lore, the only reference I’ve ever heard to ‘the heart of the dragon’ was in relation to a Japanese warrior from one hundred years ago,” the woman explained. “In fact, he was called the Heart of the Dragon.”</p><p>Her interest piqued, yet managing to stay in character, Deanna pressed for more information.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she said slowly. “This was something we heard them talking about in Chinatown, not Japantown.” Then she chuckled. “For that matter, is there even any such place as Japantown?”</p><p>Mary elbowed her in the ribs.</p><p>“Mom! C’mon, this could be what we’re looking for.” She tugged nervously at her ever-present charm bracelet.</p><p>“Yes, dear,” Deanna said. Rubbing her side, she tossed the librarian a conspiratorial smile. “Teenagers—what can you do?”</p><p>“They certainly can be impatient,” the woman agreed.</p><p>“But to answer your question, there is a section of the city we call Japantown—in fact, that’s where my parents live.”</p><p>“Would you have any books that talk about the warrior you mentioned?” Deanna asked. “I’m afraid my daughter won’t let me rest until we find something.”</p><p>“There’s at least one I can recall—but it may not help you much, I’m afraid. You see, it’s a text in Japanese. I can have it sent over, but unless you read the language.…” She trailed off with a shrug.</p><p>Jack stepped forward.</p><p>“That won’t be a problem,” he said crisply. “How soon can the book be delivered?”</p><p>The librarian shrugged again.</p><p>“It usually takes an hour or so,” she said. “But I’m afraid we wouldn’t be able to have it before the library closes for the day.”</p><p>“Can you hold it for us, though, to look at tomorrow morning?” Jack asked eagerly.</p><p>“Absolutely!” the librarian said, caught up in his enthusiasm. “I’ll just need your name.”</p><p>“John Riet. That’s R-I-E-T.”</p><p>“Very well, Mr. Riet, I’ll put in the request right away, and set the book aside for you to look at in the morning. Just come back to this desk and give your name.”</p><p>“Groovy.” He turned to Deanna. “I’ve got a friend who’s in the Oriental Studies Department at Berkeley. He owes my parents a favor, so he should be able to help out.”</p><p>That settled, they headed for the lobby and out the door into the brisk San Francisco afternoon. The sun was bright in the sky, so the air was warm now, and there was a pleasant breeze. One of the things Deanna had loved about this city the last time they visited was the constancy of the weather. It was as if the place was enmeshed in a permanent spring.</p><p>Mary peered curiously at Jack.</p><p>“John Riet?”</p><p>“John’s my real name, but since it was also Dad’s name, everyone called me Jack,” he explained. “You know, like Jack Kennedy. And ‘riet’ is Dutch for ‘cane.’”</p><p>“Oh,” she said. “Groovy.”</p><p>Deanna interrupted them.</p><p>“Mary, you and I need to go back to the hotel to see if Samuel has checked in or not.” Then she turned. “Jack, we can give you a call when we know what the next step is.”</p><p>“Right on,” he said. “Actually, I could come back with you, and we could have some lunch. I know a great place.…”</p><p>Mary’s face brightened, but Deanna knew how Samuel would feel about that. Beyond the fact that he was certain Jack wanted to get Mary alone, his disdain for other hunters was nigh-on legendary. He was sure to balk at sharing yet another meal with the young man, especially so soon.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Jack,” she said sincerely, “but not today. We’ll call you, all right?”</p><p>“Sure thing.” Jack sounded as disappointed as Mary looked, so Deanna grabbed her daughter’s hand and practically dragged her toward the bus stop. It was just as she had said to the librarian.</p><p>Teenagers—what can you do?</p><p>* * *</p><p>Samuel hadn’t held out much hope for assistance in Chinatown as long as he was posing as an FBI agent. In fact, just generally being Caucasian would work against him. Maybe he’d send Mary in later, have her play the open-minded hippie trying to grok the Oriental culture, and shadow her.</p><p>So, after taking a nap, he decided to head to the first crime scene, where Michael “Moondoggy” Verlander met his death, located in the Inner Mission.</p><p>He still wasn’t happy that Deanna had convinced him to keep Bartow involved. Samuel had tolerated his presence, and yes, he’d been the one to bring them this job, but Samuel just didn’t like being around other hunters. They always assumed you felt the same way they did, but as far as Samuel was concerned, a jackass was still a jackass—and a lot of them had turned out to be jackasses.</p><p>As he walked down Guerrero Street, he saw a bunch of kids gathered together, shouting slogans. One of them was standing on a milk crate at the center of the group, making a speech. Some of the kids held signs that read things like PEACE and MAKE LOVE, NOT WAR. More than half of them were wearing tie-dyed shirts that gave Samuel a headache just to look at, and most of them were in desperate need of a haircut—including the women. Some were barefoot, others wearing sandals.</p><p>There was a boy sitting next to the speaker strumming on a guitar, but the tune couldn’t be heard over the shouting.</p><p>On the one hand, Samuel understood those who didn’t wish to fight in the war in Southeast Asia. Having served in both World War II and Korea, he knew there was a big difference. The former needed to be fought—the latter was mostly just an excuse to get people killed for no good reason. Vietnam seemed to be more of the same after Korea. But Samuel couldn’t in good conscience agree with the song by one of the Beatles who crooned: “Give peace a chance.”</p><p>Because if you did that, then you’d already lost.</p><p>The enemy wasn’t the Viet Cong, though, and it wasn’t the Chinese or the Soviets or the North Koreans. Hell, it wasn’t even the Nazis. The real enemy was largely unseen, and unknown, and a lot worse.</p><p>The only way to stop the real enemy was to fight. The only alternative was to lose and die. And Samuel had no intention of dying any time soon.</p><p>Still, he mused as he continued down Guerrero toward the apartment building, he couldn’t really bring himself to blame most people for feeling the way they did. Unless you knew—really knew—what the world was like, you’d think that giving peace a chance might be preferable to dying in a faraway jungle nobody cared about.</p><p>They still needed haircuts, though.</p><p>When he reached the third floor of the apartment building, he saw that the crime-scene tape was still attached to one side of the doorframe, hanging loosely toward the floor and fluttering in an almost imperceptible breeze. Given that the hallway hadn’t been swept and the windows not cleaned since before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, this particular bit of failed maintenance wasn’t much of a shock.</p><p>He was about to knock on the door, which was covered with peace-sign stickers and other odd decals, when it opened to reveal a very angry face. A huge hook nose was framed by tiny eyes and a thin-lipped mouth, which was ameliorated somewhat by the thick mustache its owner wore. Unfortunately, it was brick red, while his hair—including sideburns in dire need of a trim—was dark brown. The contrast was comical, and only Samuel’s experience with disguises assured him that the facial hair was real.</p><p>“Whaddaya want, man?” the face demanded.</p><p>Recalling something from both Bartow’s conversation and Verlander’s casefile, Samuel put on his most stentorian voice.</p><p>“Are you Frederick Gorczyk?”</p><p>“Who wants to know?”</p><p>Holding up the false identification, Samuel answered authoritatively.</p><p>“I’m Special Agent Jones.” One thing he’d learned early on was that FBI agents never referred to themselves as just “Agent So-and-so,” and they never called themselves “FBI agents,” either. It was a small thing, but it could make or break an impersonation.</p><p>Gorczyk blinked, some of the anger fading.</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Samuel continued.</p><p>“If you are Frederick Gorczyk, I have some questions for you regarding the death of Michael Verlander.”</p><p>“And if I ain’t him?”</p><p>Samuel gave a very small smirk.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to arrest you for trespassing.”</p><p>Gorczyk made a noise like an exploding pipe.</p><p>“I ain’t trespassin’, man, I’m Freddie Gorczyk.” Samuel noted that he pronounced it “gore-chick,” not “gore-zik.”</p><p>“My apologies for the mispronunciation, Mr. Gorczyk,” he said, and he motioned into the apartment. “May I come in?”</p><p>“Sure, fine.” Gorczyk, who’d been blocking the doorway the entire time, opened the door wide, turned, and led him into the small living room.</p><p>On the left was a wall filled with metal braces screwed into it, used to hold up wooden bookshelves. Most of them were stuffed with books, but one shelf had a record player, with speakers sitting on the floor beneath it.</p><p>On the right was a couch, and several stained posters decorated the wall advertising various concerts, festivals and exhibits. Samuel recognized a few of the bands from records Mary had asked him to buy for her as birthday and Christmas presents.</p><p>The carpet was cheap, stained and faded, but he could clearly see that it had been vacuumed recently. There was also a rectangular section cut out of it, right in front of the battered leather couch. Samuel recalled a mention in Verlander’s file about the coffee table being burned and the ashes and carpet going to the lab for analysis. That explained the cutout.</p><p>After looking over the living room in silence, Samuel turned to Gorczyk.</p><p>“I need to know what Mr. Verlander was doing in your apartment.”</p><p>“Messin’ it up, is what he was doin’! Look, I went east for Woodstock back in August, okay, man?” When Samuel didn’t respond, he continued. “And once I got there I realized that New York City, man, that’s where it’s at! So I stayed. I’d already asked Moondoggy—that’s ‘Mr. Verlander,’ okay?—to house-sit while I was at the festival, and I called him and told him to keep on keepin’ on while I tried to break in, okay?”</p><p>“Break in?”</p><p>“You know, get gigs. For my music, man.”</p><p>“So what happened?” Samuel asked.</p><p>Gorczyk started waving his hands wildly.</p><p>“He lost my cat, man! Broke my stuff, even scratched my LPs! Practically burned down my whole apartment. And then he got himself killed, so I can’t even get no restitution or nothin’.”</p><p>“I’m sorry for your problems, Mr. Gorczyk,” Samuel said with as much sincerity as he could muster—which wasn’t all that much, really—then added, “but I need details. Do you know who he might have entertained while he was here?”</p><p>“Anybody who got him grass, is who.” Gorczyk swallowed, adding hastily, “Uh, not that I know nothin’ about that, man. Not my thing.”</p><p>A glance into the kitchenette revealed a lot of empty potato-chip bags, and Samuel smiled to himself.</p><p>“I’m investigating a murder, son—I couldn’t care less about what you or Mr. Verlander smoke.”</p><p>“Yeah, okay.” Gorczyk didn’t sound like he believed that. Then he brightened. “Oh, hey, man, you know who you oughtta talk to? Mrs. Holzaur. She lives next door in 3C, and she’s always seein’ stuff. I asked her to keep an eye on Moondoggy, okay? She mighta seen somethin’. I don’t know if the pi—uh, the cops talked to her or not.”</p><p>Again, Samuel smiled to himself, but he decided not to respond to the veiled reference.</p><p>Instead, he crouched down near the cut-out bit of carpet, where he noticed some yellow crystals.</p><p>Sulfur.</p><p>Not that Samuel harbored any doubts at this point, but the sight of sulfur confirmed that this was something he and his family needed to take care of, and quickly.</p><p>It may or may not have been a dragon, but a demon was definitely involved.</p><p>Getting to his feet, he motioned to leave.</p><p>“Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr. Gorczyk,” he said. “You’ve been a great help.”</p><p>“Sure, man. Just hope you catch the guy. Moondoggy was a jerk, but he didn’t deserve what he got.”</p><p>Stepping out into the hall, the door clicking shut behind him, Samuel knocked on the door to apartment 3C. Unlike the door to Gorczyk’s apartment, 3B, Mrs. Holzaur’s door was empty save for the tarnished brass number and letter.</p><p>A short, wrinkled woman wearing a faded housedress, curlers in her hair, answered the door. A lit cigarette dangled from between her lips.</p><p>“Are you Mrs. Holzaur?”</p><p>“You a policeman, mister?” she asked in a raspy voice.</p><p>“Federal agent, actually—Special Agent Jones.”</p><p>“Too bad. I was hopin’ you’d be a policeman, on account’a I ain’t heard from none of ‘em.” She took a drag on her cigarette.</p><p>“I’m sorry, ma’am?”</p><p>Blowing smoke in Samuel’s face, Mrs. Holzaur coughed, then spoke.</p><p>“I told them policemen when that man was murdered, I told ‘em to talk to me, that I knew stuff about the yippies and the aliens and the Chinee and whatnot.”</p><p>“You’re talking about the murder of your next-door neighbor, Michael Verlander, yes?”</p><p>“He ain’t my neighbor. He was watchin’ the place for my neighbor. One’a them yippies, or whatever they call ‘em. My husband was still alive, he’d’a shot ‘em both, and that’s the truth.”</p><p>“No doubt, Mrs. Holzaur,” Samuel said quickly. “Now what’s that about aliens and—and the Chinee?”</p><p>“The aliens, see, them’s the ones who made the mary-jew-ana. Smokin’ that stuff, see, that’s what leads to people turnin’ into aliens, and then they’re gonna take over. Been tellin’ the policemen this, every chance I get, but they don’t do nothin’!” She took another drag on her cigarette.</p><p>One thing the Campbell family had learned early on was that the crazy ones were worth paying attention to—often there was good wheat among all that chaff. So he waited to see if Mrs. Holzaur would carry on about marijuana and the alien plot to destroy the youth of America. When she seemed to have abated, he began to ask questions.</p><p>“And how does the Chinese person fit into this?”</p><p>“It’s obvious ain’t it? That yippie fella asked me to let in his friend while he went out to meet with his alien buddies. Told me to let this guy—Albert—have something to eat.”</p><p>Samuel brightened.</p><p>“Albert?”</p><p>“Yeah, told me to give Albert some chow. Like I need to feed some Chinee kook.”</p><p>“Did you feed him?”</p><p>More smoke in Samuel’s face for that one.</p><p>“‘Course not! Albert can chow down on his own damn time, you ask me. Damn Chinee, them people’re takin’ over! You watch, ‘fore too long, we’ll all be slant-eyed devils like them, and then where’ll we be, huh?” She dragged on her cigarette, then dropped it to the linoleum floor of the hall. “If my husband was alive, he’d take his shotgun to ‘em all, and that’s no lie.”</p><p>Samuel nodded noncommittally, careful not to show any sign of the elation that swept over him.</p><p>“Thank you for your time, Mrs. Holzaur. The FBI appreciates your input, and rest assured we’ll be giving your allegations the full attention that they warrant.”</p><p>“Yeah, right—you’re just like all men, all talk and no action, that’s your problem. If my husband was alive, he’d take a shotgun right to your head, I’ll tell you that for free.”</p><p>Samuel turned his back on Mrs. Holzaur, who continued to natter on to herself about aliens and yippies and the Chinee and what her husband would do with his shotgun. He had a spring in his step, because now he had a name.</p><p>Albert.</p><p>He somehow doubted that Moondoggy would want the loony lady next door to provide Albert with chow. But he might well ask her to let in someone named Albert Chao.</p><p>Now Samuel just had to figure out who Albert Chao was and what he had wanted with Moondoggy.…</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>David Severn would have been perfectly happy, except for the pain in his ankles.</p><p>But it had been worth it. He’d been trying to find the perfect date, and this seemed to be it. Debbie was his best girl, and after a hard week working as a supermarket manager, he was darn well going to show her a good time.</p><p>Their first three dates had been busts. She had sneezed a lot at Golden Gate Park, and didn’t enjoy Ghirardelli Square, saying that shopping wasn’t romantic—it was something she did with her mother. And then there was the Fillmore.</p><p>It had been against David’s better judgment to go to one of those loud music shows: a bunch of weirdos dressed like circus clowns playing music that was far too loud and not remotely melodious. David preferred his musicians to be clean-cut and well dressed and actually proficient, like The Ventures or Buddy Holly, God rest his soul, or like The Beatles before they started taking drugs.</p><p>For Debbie’s sake, however, he had pretended to enjoy himself—she was his best girl, after all, and an absolute sweetheart—but he hoped she wouldn’t want to do that again.</p><p>But as they’d left the Fillmore that night, they’d walked down Geary Boulevard and up Steiner Street to where David had parked his car. On the way, they passed Winterland. David knew it was an ice-skating rink, but Debbie mentioned that the owner of the Fillmore sometimes rented it for concerts that were too big to fit in the smaller venue.</p><p>Then she commented on her love of ice-skating.</p><p>Right then and there, David had the next Friday’s date planned out.</p><p>Sure enough, she loved it. Debbie was an excellent skater, too—which was more than David could say for himself. He fell over several times, more than once on his rear end, but Debbie just laughed and helped him up and showed him how to do it properly.</p><p>After a while, he’d gotten it down pat. But boy, did his ankles hurt.</p><p>Still, on the whole the date had gone very well. Debbie had so much fun that they wound up making out near the locker room until the place closed down and the staff had to throw them out.</p><p>As they exited onto Steiner Street, David put his arm around Debbie’s waist.</p><p>“You really skated beautifully, doll.”</p><p>“Thanks.” She smiled up at him. She loved it when he called her “doll.” “When I was growing up,” she said, “I used to watch Sonja Henie’s movies all the time. She was my hero.”</p><p>“Wow—it’s kismet,” he said profoundly.</p><p>“What do you mean?” she asked, a puzzled look crossing her face.</p><p>“Well, you know that Buddy Holly’s my hero. That means that both of our heroes died in plane crashes!”</p><p>She stiffened under his arm.</p><p>“She died of leukemia,” Debbie said sternly. “She just happened to die while she was flying home to Oslo.”</p><p>Crestfallen, David didn’t know how to respond.</p><p>“Oh,” he said. Before he could try to salvage the conversation, a voice came from behind them.</p><p>“Hello, David.”</p><p>Whirling around, he saw a young pointy-nosed Oriental in a Nehru jacket and green slacks. But despite the man’s unique appearance, David didn’t recognize him at all, and was a bit insulted at the familiarity from someone like him.</p><p>“Excuse me? Have we met?”</p><p>Debbie moved in closer, and he held her more tightly. He shifted slightly to place himself between her and the Oriental.</p><p>“David, who is this?” she asked nervously.</p><p>“That’s what I’m gonna find out, doll.”</p><p>The Oriental shook his head.</p><p>“You really don’t remember, do you?”</p><p>“Remember what?” David asked angrily. “Who are you?”</p><p>“You have the unmitigated gall to ask me that?” the man responded, his voice rising with each word. “I’m Albert Chao! I’m the man you fired just because I talked to the wrong girl!”</p><p>Debbie looked up at him.</p><p>“Is that true, David?”</p><p>He swallowed now, trying to remember. The supermarket’s owner, Mr. Wilhelm, had always insisted on hiring Orientals as stock boys, but he’d left the firing to David. He supposed this Chao character was one of them.</p><p>“Look, buddy,” he said, putting on his best manager’s voice, “if I did fire you, it was for a good reason, all right? So let me and my girl here move along, and you can go back to your opium den or wherever.”</p><p>The Oriental broke into a big grin.</p><p>“Oh, I’m going to enjoy this.”</p><p>Something about that grin got under David’s skin, and he didn’t want to look at it anymore. Remembering the boxing classes he’d taken at school, he extricated himself from Debbie, stood in a proper fighting stance, and punched Chao right in the face.</p><p>The Oriental tried to duck, but he wasn’t fast enough. The impact of David’s fist on the man’s nose sent sharp knives of pain cascading up and down his arm, and as he heard the crack of bone breaking, he hissed out a sharp breath. He didn’t remember it hurting this much to punch someone. Of course, he’d worn gloves back then.…</p><p>Debbie, bless her, ran right up to him.</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>But the Oriental hadn’t budged. His pointy nose was bloodied but he seemed unfazed.</p><p>David couldn’t believe it—that was his best punch!</p><p>Then the man started muttering something. David couldn’t understand a word he was saying, but there was something in the way he whispered it that sent a chill through his bones.</p><p>Debbie held him tighter.</p><p>“David, what’s he doing?”</p><p>“I—I don’t—“ David stammered. Then he found he couldn’t catch his breath.</p><p>What the hell is he doing?</p><p>Then Chao stopped speaking, and the sudden silence was even more frightening. David found that he couldn’t even hear the noises of the street. It was a Friday night in the middle of San Francisco, there was noise everywhere, but David couldn’t hear anything except the ragged sounds of his own breathing and the beating of his heart against his rib cage.</p><p>Suddenly, hot air pushed hard against his face. Sweat formed almost instantly, even as he saw a huge fire erupt from the Steiner Street sidewalk.</p><p>A man stood in the center of the fire. David couldn’t make out his features, but he somehow just knew that the figure was staring right at him.</p><p>It was like something in one of those bizarre psychedelic songs that that band had played at the Fillmore. This couldn’t possibly be happening. Yet he could feel the fire on his face, see the flames flickering into the night air—and hear Debbie’s strangled cry.</p><p>The man in the fire raised a giant sword.</p><p>The last thing David heard was his own scream.</p><p>The Campbells converged on the Emperor Norton Lodge.</p><p>Much to Samuel’s chagrin, Mary also called Jack and told him about the sulfur that had been found at the first murder scene. He promised to see if he could find out whether or not there had been any signs of demonic activity recently.</p><p>Deanna revealed that they had found a lead on “the heart of the dragon,” but that it was in Japanese. Samuel was dubious—Chao was a Chinese name—but every little bit helped. They’d know more when Bartow’s professor friend at Berkeley translated the texts.</p><p>Then—armed with a name—they split up, each trying to find the man known as Albert Chao, and any connection he might have with the other victims.</p><p>They all returned to the Lodge late that night. Deanna ordered them a room-service meal, and the family compared notes.</p><p>Samuel went first.</p><p>“I found a lead on a possible target, but I got there too late. First I checked the bars near where Verlander was killed, and found a place where the name Albert Chao rung a bell. The bartender told me that Albert had been fired from a supermarket job two months ago, and he was angry about it.</p><p>“So I tracked down the supermarket and found out who did the firing. They said the guy was taking his girlfriend to Winterland tonight.”</p><p>Mary perked up.</p><p>“Ooh, who was playing?”</p><p>“It’s a skating rink, Mary,” Samuel said with a frown.</p><p>“Really? I thought it was a concert hall. Hendrix and the Dead play there all the time.”</p><p>Samuel didn’t even pretend to know what she meant.</p><p>“Anyhow, when I got to Winterland, the cops were already there, just down the street, and so were reporters. Both the supermarket manager and his girlfriend had been burned to death and cut to ribbons.”</p><p>Deanna winced.</p><p>“Oh no!”</p><p>Mary’s mouth set in a line.</p><p>“We’ve got to stop this guy, Dad.”</p><p>“Well, I’m open to suggestions,” Samuel said bitterly, angry at having failed to get there in time. “What did you find out at Berkeley?”</p><p>Mary had headed to Berkeley to talk to some of Marybeth Wenzel’s fellow students, under the guise of being a high-school student who was looking into Berkeley as a possible college. Her cover was that she was concerned at the news that one of the students had been killed.</p><p>“Marybeth got straight As, and all her friends thought she was pretty swell. The only thing was that people said she had weird taste in men.”</p><p>Samuel frowned.</p><p>“What does ‘weird’ mean, exactly?”</p><p>Mary’s expression mirrored his own, a look of distaste on her face.</p><p>“The girls wouldn’t say, but there was one boy who claimed, ‘She only liked slant-eyes.’ I think he meant Orientals.”</p><p>Samuel nodded.</p><p>“So this is one of Chao’s old flames?”</p><p>“That’s my guess.”</p><p>Deanna went next.</p><p>“Not surprised it’s an ‘old’ flame. I talked to the people at the laundry and the restaurant where the two Chinatown victims worked, pretending to be one of Albert’s old teachers, and in both cases I was told that he had worked there. Both of them said he was fired, and our two corpses are the ones who did the firing.</p><p>“What’s especially interesting is that one of the reasons he was fired from the laundry is that he lied on his application: Chao said he was Chinese—when he’s really half-Chinese and half-Japanese.”</p><p>Samuel sighed.</p><p>“So the only people Chao had a grudge against, that any of us could find out about, are dead.” If that was true, they were at a dead end.</p><p>“You think maybe he’s done?” Mary asked hopefully.</p><p>Deanna shook her head.</p><p>“There’s a demon involved here, Mary, remember? That means that it’s not going to end. Chao may think he has control of this, but he doesn’t. And the demon won’t stop the killing just because Chao’s run out of grudges.”</p><p>“Besides, a guy like that probably has a long list of people who’ve pissed him off,” Samuel said, then he sighed. “We need to find out where Chao lives. That was one thing I couldn’t get out of anyone.”</p><p>“We should call Jack, and see if he found out anything,” Mary said brightly, ignoring the shadow that crossed her father’s face.</p><p>“Okay,” he said. “Call him, but—“</p><p>Mary bounded up from the bed.</p><p>“—use the pay phone outside, I know.”</p><p>Samuel called after her as she headed to the door.</p><p>“I just don’t want to pay what the hotel charges for calls!” But she was gone before he could finish.</p><p>When the door closed behind her, Samuel looked at Deanna and started to speak, but she cut him off.</p><p>“This is why you lost your hair, right?”</p><p>At first, Samuel scowled, then he broke down and laughed. She laughed with him.</p><p>Then he pulled her into an embrace.</p><p>“You still love me, even though I’m a broken-down old bald man?”</p><p>“You’re darn tootin’, Mr. Man,” she said with a mischievous grin, then she kissed him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Albert showed them. He showed them all.</p><p>I’m sorry, Albert, you’re nice and all, but—you’re just too heavy for me. I just can’t handle all that intensity, you dig? Call me when you lighten up.…</p><p>“Lighten up?” Pfagh.</p><p>He was destined for great things. He just knew it.</p><p>If only all these people wouldn’t keep getting in his way.</p><p>I don’t want liars on my payroll, nor half-breeds. Remove yourself from my establishment before I throw you out.</p><p>Before she died, his mother used to tell him stories of her ancestor, the legendary Heart of the Dragon: a ronin who had traveled the countryside of feudal Japan righting wrongs and punishing the guilty, until he was condemned by a mob of ignorant peasants.</p><p>I saw you talking to that girl. We don’t like that kind of behavior around here, mister. Consider yourself fired.</p><p>People liked to think that ignorant peasants didn’t exist in this day and age. After all, a man had walked on the moon, which meant mankind had evolved, right?</p><p>Wrong.</p><p>It took different forms these days, but it was the same old song.</p><p>After that bastard at the supermarket fired him, he fell into a deep state of depression. All he could imagine, all he could see, all he could dream about were the people who kept him down.</p><p>Stupid half-breed! You don’t belong in Chinatown with the real people!</p><p>It had started when he was a child, with the other Chinatown kids taunting him because his mother was Japanese. His parents both told him they were just ignorant, that they were kids who didn’t know any better, and things would improve when he grew up.</p><p>But things didn’t improve. Everywhere he turned he was met with rejection, disgust, and revulsion.</p><p>But always he remembered his mother’s stories about the Heart of the Dragon.</p><p>Once he was unemployed, he had plenty of time on his hands. So he took a trip to the library, tried to see if there was anything in their collection of Japanese texts.</p><p>And he found more than he had bargained for.</p><p>The stories told of a demon who had imprisoned Doragon Kokoro’s soul. Yet according to the texts, the power of blood could supersede the power of the demon’s incantation.</p><p>A descendant of the Heart of the Dragon could summon his demon-tainted ancestor back to the land of the living, where it would wield great power.</p><p>The problem was that the texts were incomplete, so he wasn’t sure of the entirety of the spell, nor its ultimate effect. Still, he was certain that it would tether the Heart of the Dragon to him, thus granting him the ability to right all wrongs, and remove the petty people from his life.</p><p>There was another spell—this one complete—that would banish the spirit again for eighty seasons, but what use had he for that? Why would he wield great power, only to surrender it?</p><p>At first he hadn’t entirely believed everything he read. But what did he have to lose?</p><p>He had no girl.</p><p>No family, no job, no friends.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>But he had a destiny. He was a descendant of the Heart of the Dragon. He deserved better—and he would have it.</p><p>Someone in a bar he frequented told him about Moondoggy Verlander, a burned-out hippie who was good at tracking down the arcane, and Albert hired him. Moondoggy became his first test subject, and he had felt a bit of remorse about that, but the results were exactly what he had hoped for. Guilt quickly gave way to euphoria.</p><p>Then Albert was finally able to avenge himself on those who had wronged him, who had kept him from his destiny.</p><p>Now they were gone, he found himself at a crossroads. What was next for him and his very own ancestral ronin?</p><p>It had caught him off guard, when that idiot supermarket manager had punched him. But, though startled, Albert had only felt a brief sensation of pain. And even though he was pretty sure he’d heard the crack of his nose breaking, when he had wiped away the blood, he had found no injury.</p><p>It seemed as if he was indestructible as long as he had the Heart of the Dragon bound to him. That hadn’t been in the texts, and he wondered what other unknown facets existed in this great union between him and his ancestor. What else had been contained in that lost text?</p><p>Looking around now, he knew there had to be more that he could do.</p><p>Enough dwelling on the past, he mused. He needed to think about his future.</p><p>The apartment in which he lived was, charitably speaking, a dump. The “pad,” as the landlord had referred to it, was tiny, with warped wood floors in the living room, a frayed and stained carpet in the bedroom, and cracked linoleum in the kitchen. He could barely afford a hammock to sleep on, and macaroni in the cabinet. The only reason he had a chair was that he’d found it on the street.</p><p>He needed to move up in the world.</p><p>And the Heart of the Dragon would accomplish that for him.</p><p>With a small smile at the thought of what he might be able to achieve, he once again started to chant the spell. Perhaps spending more time with the ronin would allow him to take what was rightfully his from society.</p><p>The fires of the netherworld burned bright, and the form of the ronin appeared within the flames that licked toward the ceiling. Just as fire had consumed Yoshio Nakadai in his death, so did flames continue to follow him across the centuries. Albert felt the warmth of the fire dance on his face, driving out the chill of the inadequately heated apartment.</p><p>Yet it wasn’t just heat he felt. No, it was power. He had in his possession a creature who could kill anyone. It was time he used his ancestor for something other than petty revenge.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon had been a great hero, renowned throughout Japan. Albert Chao was determined to be at least as famous.</p><p>He hadn’t had the money to pay Moondoggy, but now he could get all the money he wanted.</p><p>A loud noise from behind him prompted him to spin around, only to find a bald man standing in the doorway. He had apparently kicked the door in, splintering the lock, which irritated Albert. Not so much that he’d kicked in the door, but that his apartment was so awful that its door could so easily be kicked in.</p><p>The man had a handgun, but he didn’t look like a robber.</p><p>“Who are you?” he demanded.</p><p>“My name doesn’t matter,” the bald man said. “But I know yours. You’re Albert Chao, you’ve killed six people in cold blood—and I’m here to stop you.”</p><p>Albert broke into a large smile.</p><p>“I doubt that.”</p><p>And wordlessly he willed the Heart of the Dragon to kill the bald man. Surrounded by the eternal fires, the spirit married Albert’s thoughts to immediate action. The ronin raised the katana over his head at an angle, ready for an immediate downward sokutso slice at the bald man’s collarbone. As he did so, Albert spoke again.</p><p>“I control the Heart of the Dragon, gaijin. He is mine to command for as long as I live.”</p><p>“Fine,” the bald man said. He raised his gun and shot Albert.</p><p>Samuel had to admit to enjoying the look of utter shock on Albert Chao’s face as the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 60 revolver’s .38 calibre bullet slammed into Chao’s knee, blood blooming into a stain on his pants leg as the young man fell to the warped wood floor.</p><p>Chao’s head collided with the wall on the way down, slicing open a nasty gash on his forehead.</p><p>Unfortunately, while it put Chao down for the count, the man with the sword was still moving toward him, wreathed in flames that flickered cruelly in the dimly lit apartment.</p><p>Samuel pointed his revolver at the spirit.</p><p>“That’s not going to do any good, Samuel,” Deanna said from behind him. She and Mary had waited in the hallway, preparing the counter spell that they’d found in the library, helpfully translated by Bartow’s professor friend at Berkeley.</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Samuel snapped over his shoulder as he hastily backed away from the spirit as it bore down on him. “I was just hoping it might flinch a bit. Handguns weren’t all that common in feudal Japan.”</p><p>The extensive notes Bartow had provided told of a masterless samurai named Yoshio Nakadai who had lived in nineteenth-century Japan and who had been given the nickname of Doragon Kokoro, which translated to “heart of the dragon.”</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>They chronicled his death, allegedly at the hands of a demon, and revealed that his spirit could be resurrected by a descendant possessing the proper incantation, a portion of which was included amidst the papers at the library.</p><p>Since Chao was half-Japanese, they realized he may well have been kin to Nakadai.</p><p>The demon’s role in Nakadai’s death explained the sulfuric residue. Bartow hadn’t found any other omens that indicated demonic activity—which was pretty rare, in any case—so he and the Campbells chalked it up to the spirit’s origins, rather than any specific demonic intent.</p><p>Also amidst the texts was a spell that could send the spirit back—and this one was complete. It didn’t banish the spirit permanently, but it beat the alternative.…</p><p>The most valuable piece of information gleaned from their research, however, had been an SFPL call slip that was stuck between two pages. Bartow had pocketed it immediately, because the slip had revealed the name and address of the last person who had taken the book out.</p><p>Albert Chao.</p><p>Once they had transcribed the counterspell, and gathered the materials they’d need to cast it, they headed to Chao’s apartment, hoping to stop him before he instructed the Heart of the Dragon to kill anyone else. Just now that next victim looked likely to be Samuel himself, as he barely dodged a powerful slice from the spirit’s katana.</p><p>Samuel put a hand to his cheek, which was hot from the proximity of the flames. Strangely enough, though he could feel the heat, the fire hadn’t set the apartment alight.</p><p>“How’s that spell coming, Little Miss?” Samuel called to Mary.</p><p>“Don’t call me that!” she shouted from the hallway.</p><p>Then she came into view in the doorway. In her right hand she held a piece of notepaper with the phonetic spelling of the words to the spell. In her left she had a pinch of pulverized kihada root, which they had purchased from a small drugstore in San Francisco’s tiny Japantown.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon swung his sword once again.</p><p>Samuel tripped over a battered chair, which was all that saved him as the fiery blade of the katana singed his bald scalp. The apartment was very sparsely furnished, but it was also very small, and very soon Samuel was going to run out of places to dodge.</p><p>“Where’s the damn Claymore?” he asked Deanna, who was keeping herself between the spirit and Mary.</p><p>“Are you out of your mind? That’s a katana! It’d slice the Claymore in two!”</p><p>The spirit reared above him wielding its flaming weapon, without realizing it, Samuel suddenly found himself literally backed into a corner.</p><p>He heard a voice. Mary was speaking the incantation slowly, making sure to get the pronunciation right. He knew she had to do it right in order for it to work, but if she didn’t hurry up, he was going to be skewered and burned to a crisp.</p><p>Samuel thought quickly: there was a window nearby, but a quick glance revealed that it wasn’t the one with the fire escape. Albert lived on a fifth-story walk-up, so jumping out wasn’t an option.</p><p>In the moments before the creature struck, he really wished that shooting Albert had broken the man’s hold on the spirit.</p><p>Dammit.</p><p>The warrior raised his katana. Heat from the demonic flames licked across Samuel’s face. He’d been half tempted to fire his revolver, just to see what would happen, but knew that he’d only be wasting a bullet.</p><p>Now, though, he’d take whatever he could, because there was nowhere to dodge, nowhere to run.…</p><p>He raised the pistol.</p><p>Mary finished the incantation and threw the pulverized root into the flames that surrounded the ronin.</p><p>Though the katana remained raised, the spirit threw its head back and screamed. The flames grew hotter, and Samuel had to put his hands in front of his face to try to ward off the pounding heat.</p><p>A flash of light.</p><p>Then nothing.</p><p>Mary was grinning.</p><p>“Guess it worked,” she said triumphantly.</p><p>“For the time being,” Deanna said. “Remember what the professor’s notes said: all this spell does is banish it for twenty years.”</p><p>Mary shrugged.</p><p>“So we come back in twenty years and stop it again. We can come down in a shuttle from our house on the moon.”</p><p>Samuel rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Moon shuttle. Right. If we’re on the moon, we’ll be too busy fighting the monsters up there, I’ll bet.”</p><p>Even as he spoke, the sound of sirens pierced the quiet of the evening. Glancing out of the window, he saw both fire trucks and police vehicles approaching the building.</p><p>“We need to scram,” he said urgently. Chao was harmless now—or, rather, for the next twenty years—and he needed medical attention. But the police could handle that. The Campbells needed to beat feet out of there.</p><p>As they dashed down the back stairs toward the back-alley exit that would, with luck, keep them away from the police, Deanna spoke in a terse whisper.</p><p>“When we get back to the hotel, I’ll call Marty and arrange for a flight home.”</p><p>Feeling magnanimous after the successful hunt, Samuel added his own two cents.</p><p>“And then you can call Jack, Little Miss. Maybe the two of you can have dinner together.”</p><p>Deanna shot him a look that expressed surprise, but Mary shook her head.</p><p>“That’s okay, Dad. I mean, we could all have dinner with him, as a thank you, I guess.”</p><p>They ran out of the back door, heading toward the street that ran behind the building.</p><p>“I thought you liked the boy.”</p><p>“He’s nice,” Mary said, “and it was good to see him. But, like you always say, Dad, romance and hunting don’t mix.” She grinned. “Except for you two.”</p><p>Deanna chuckled as they headed toward a bus stop.</p><p>“Let’s go home.”</p><p>Albert inhaled sharply, then sat up quickly.</p><p>His knee felt fine.</p><p>Putting a hand to his head, he found that the gash had closed over, and he wiped the blood away.</p><p>Unlike the simple punch from the previous night, this was a pair of wounds, and it took a bit longer for them to heal back up. First the knee injury, which sent paroxysms of pain throughout his entire body. When he hit the wall, he did pass out for a few seconds—but he heard bits of conversation among those three gaijin, including the girl speaking—with an awful accent—the words to the other spell he’d found in the library.</p><p>But by the time they’d finished casting the spell and left, he was whole again. Whatever link he had with the Heart of the Dragon, it still existed.</p><p>He could not be hurt—at least not permanently.</p><p>He yanked up his bloodstained pant leg, exposing the bare flesh. There was blood on his knee, but the skin itself was unbroken and unscarred.</p><p>He grinned. It was like magic.</p><p>In fact it was magic—very good magic.</p><p>While Albert had no idea who those three gaijin had been, he knew that they thought the battle was over—at least for the next two decades.</p><p>But by the time twenty years rolled around again, Albert intended to be ready.</p><p>Three police officers appeared at his broken door.</p><p>“Don’t move!”</p><p>“What’s going on, officers?” he asked innocently.</p><p>“We got a report of gunshots being fired,” one of them said.</p><p>“No, sir, officer,” Albert responded in as deferential a voice as he could manage. The last thing he wanted right now was trouble with the police.</p><p>Another officer inspected the shattered lock.</p><p>“Your door looks like it’s been kicked in.”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve been trying to get the landlord to fix that for weeks,” he replied.</p><p>The officer snorted. “I’ll bet.” Then he looked down. “What happened to your leg?”</p><p>“Got the pants from Goodwill. Can’t afford to be picky these days, you know?”</p><p>The police had a few more questions, but other than the door, there was no evidence of a crime, and they didn’t seem eager to pursue it.</p><p>As soon as they left, Albert smiled.</p><p>That taken care of, he now had two decades to figure out the best way to put the power of his ancestor to his use.</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Y’know,” Sam Winchester said, “it still freaks me out a little.”</p><p>Dean was still staring at the printout of the forty year-old San Francisco Chronicle article.</p><p>“What, that Mom and our grandparents were hunters?” Dean remembered how stunned he’d been when a nineteen year-old girl had started beating the crap out of him—and then he’d seen the protective charm bracelet she was wearing and put two and two together.</p><p>Mom really knew how to kick ass.</p><p>Family history had never been a huge priority for the Winchesters while they were growing up, though. Dean’s grandparents were barely remembered faces on faded pictures that had hung on the staircase wall. The only family that had mattered after Mom died were Sam and Dad, and later folks like Bobby—who had become a surrogate uncle to the boys, and more as they grew older. And Caleb and Pastor Jim.</p><p>Sam smiled when he answered Dean’s question.</p><p>“No, somehow it makes sense that they would be hunters,” he said. “But it’s weird that we were named after them, and Dad never told us.”</p><p>Dean snorted derisively.</p><p>“Add it to the list of things Dad never told us. We could fill a damn—“ Suddenly, he got a faraway look in his eyes. “—book. Sonofabitch.”</p><p>Bolting from the kitchen into the living room, Dean made a beeline for the worn duffel bag he always traveled with and pulled out the leather-bound notebook that had been an integral part of their lives as hunters these past four years— ever since Dad had disappeared, and Dean had gone to Stanford to drag Sam back to the life that he’d left behind.</p><p>Dad’s journal.</p><p>Furiously, he started flipping pages until he found the section that covered the late 1980s and found what he was looking for.</p><p>“Here we go,” he shouted over his shoulder. “Heart of the Dragon—San Francisco, 1989. Twenty years later—and Dad faced it!”</p><p>Sam got up from the kitchen table and followed his brother.</p><p>“Okay, yeah, that’s starting to ring a bell. There was a sword involved, wasn’t there?”</p><p>“Yup,” came a voice from the back room. Bobby wheeled himself into the living room, a long, thin package wrapped in brown parcel paper and twine sitting on his lap as he navigated his wheelchair until he was sitting next to the brothers.</p><p>Staring up at them from under the bill of his omnipresent baseball cap, he held up the parcel.</p><p>“If you two’re goin’ after Doragon Kokoro, you’re gonna be needin’ this.”</p><p>Sam took the package.</p><p>Expecting a katana, Dean was surprised when Sam undid the twine, ripped off the plain brown paper, and unwrapped a hook sword. It had a hilt with a wrist guard and an additional piece beyond that, with the long blade that curved around at the very end to form the hook.</p><p>That wasn’t the interesting part, though: that was the runes in Asian characters—Dean could never tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese—etched into the sword’s blade.</p><p>“When your father faced off against Doragon Kokoro twenty years ago,” Bobby began, “this is what he used to send the spirit away. We were hopin’ it was permanent, but we knew we’d probably just accomplished what your grandparents apparently did, and got rid of it for two decades.</p><p>“S’why I kept the damn thing.”</p><p>Dean snorted again. Bobby didn’t need a reason to keep anything—he was the classic pack rat. And as they’d discovered time and again, in this line of work, it didn’t pay to get rid of anything that might be useful in the future.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean.</p><p>“It’s been years since I read that part of Dad’s journal. What’s it say?”</p><p>Dean looked back down at the leather-bound notebook.</p><p>“A whole bunch, actually.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>John Winchester pulled into the yard, the smell of incense still stinging his nostrils. It had been a difficult fight, but the spell he’d cast had gotten rid of the poltergeist once and for all.</p><p>Part of him had been tempted to stay behind in Henderson and get a good night’s sleep, but he’d been away from the boys for far too long. He had enrolled them in a school in South Dakota, giving the Singer Salvage Yard as their address, and the fall semester was almost over. Once it ended, he’d stop abusing Bobby Singer’s hospitality.</p><p>John wasn’t comfortable making use of it this much, but he also understood the need to give the boys as much continuity in their schooling as possible—especially six year-old Sammy.</p><p>He’d see where the work took them from here on in.</p><p>There was another reason he felt the need to see them. That poltergeist had targeted two young girls, and the danger they’d been in hit too close to home. John knew his boys would need to be able to defend themselves against whatever was out there—he’d already started that process with Dean, Sammy’s ten year-old brother. Dean was a crack shot with John’s M1911, and could load the shotgun with iron rounds and fire them off in one smooth motion.</p><p>Eventually he’d need to train Sammy, too.</p><p>But not yet.</p><p>He’d been driving all night, and the Impala’s engine was starting to make an odd clunking noise. He’d need to borrow Bobby’s tools and check it out, once he got a good night’s— or day’s—sleep.</p><p>The sun was rising in the east when he pulled in, shining haphazardly through the assorted cars, trucks, and wrecks that surrounded Bobby’s house. Squinting as he clambered out of the Impala, he walked stiffly toward the porch.</p><p>Sam ran out before he could even reach the front door.</p><p>“Dad!” the boy cried as he wrapped his arms around John’s legs.</p><p>Unable to help himself, John grinned.</p><p>“Hey there, Sammy.”</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re home!” the boy said, peering up at his father with an angry expression. “Dean’s being a creep.”</p><p>Looking up, John saw Bobby and Dean standing in the doorway. The former had on his usual: flannel shirt, ball cap, and jeans, and a look of irritation. The latter was sulking.</p><p>“I’m not a creep,” Dean protested. “I just ate the last donut. It’s no big deal!”</p><p>“But Bobby said I could have it!” Sam wailed from his position still wrapped around John’s legs.</p><p>“I said you could both have two each,” Bobby said in a long-suffering tone. He’d told John several times that he didn’t mind watching Dean and Sam, because he’d never had kids of his own. Right now, though, it looked as if he was coming to understand that there were benefits to being childless.</p><p>John started to walk toward the house, but as Sam still clung to one of his legs, it was more of an awkward shuffle. Before he got five feet they were both giggling at the ridiculousness of it. After a second, Bobby and Dean started laughing, too, and minutes later they were all sitting around Bobby’s kitchen table, back in a good mood.</p><p>Dean and Sam told him all about their adventures while he was gone. On the weekends they played games of hide-and-seek amidst the cars in the yard—a paradise for two young boys. During the week they went to school, though only Sam seemed interested in talking about that. Then again, he was in the first grade, so the course load was easier than Dean’s.</p><p>“Miss Roach said I could do third-grade work!” he said proudly.</p><p>John was surprised.</p><p>“That’s ‘cause you’re a dexter,” Dean said.</p><p>“No, it means he’s smart, Dean,” John said. “And that’s good. I’m proud of you, Sammy.”</p><p>Sam stuck out his tongue at his brother.</p><p>“Dean’s doing third-grade work, too!”</p><p>“Screw you, Sammy!” Dean said, who was now in the fifth grade.</p><p>John put on the voice that his drill sergeant had always used in the Corps.</p><p>“Hey! Enough of that!” he said sternly. “I hear any more, and you won’t like what happens.”</p><p>Both boys clammed right up, looking down at their laps abashedly.</p><p>“Sorry, sir,” Dean said.</p><p>“Sorry, Dad,” Sammy echoed.</p><p>“That’s better.”</p><p>After a while, the boys went off to play, and John followed Bobby into the living room. They sat on the couch, each holding a bottle of Budweiser, and John filled him in on the poltergeist.</p><p>“Sounds like you handled it okay,” Bobby drawled.</p><p>John chuckled at Bobby’s talent for understatement.</p><p>“Yeah. The Impala’s engine’s acting up again, by the way. I need to sleep off the drive, but I wanna put it up on the blocks later on.”</p><p>“No problem.” Bobby had been part of the community of hunters for a few years longer than John, and he’d already gained a reputation as the go-to guy for car repair. But John was a fine mechanic in his own right, and he knew the Impala’s engine better than anyone.</p><p>John rubbed his eyes, an action that cleared his vision but only served to increase his fatigue. The post-hunt adrenaline had kept him going on the road, but now that he was back with the boys, exhaustion was starting to cover him like a flannel blanket.</p><p>“Anything cooking?” he asked.</p><p>Bobby had his finger on the pulse of the hunting community better than anyone outside of Harvelle’s Roadhouse. What John really wanted to know was if he’d received any information that would lead them to Mary’s killer.</p><p>“Actually, yeah.” Bobby got to his feet and started rummaging through some of the many papers that were strewn about the desk in front of the fireplace. “Doragon Kokoro’s back.”</p><p>The name didn’t ring any bells.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“Nasty-ass spirit. Twenty years ago, it showed up in San Francisco killin’ folks. Now it’s back, and I got the only thing that’ll stop it.”</p><p>Suddenly alert, John immediately started calculating the mileage in his head.</p><p>“San Francisco’s a long way off—especially with the Impala’s engine acting up. But I can probably get out there—“</p><p>Bobby held up a hand.</p><p>“Whoa, there, John. You just said yourself that you’re wiped out. And you ain’t spent time with the kids in a dog’s age.”</p><p>John agreed with him, but at the mere mention of another hunt, another killer to destroy, another chance at maybe—maybe—finding out who killed Mary, his exhaustion fell away like autumn leaves.</p><p>“You got someone else who can do it?”</p><p>Bobby hesitated, and that was all John needed.</p><p>“You said people are dyin’, Bobby. That’s all that matters.” And revenge, but he didn’t need to mention that. “What do I need to do?”</p><p>Reaching behind his desk, Bobby pulled up a sword from the floor. John was confused as to why it wasn’t in a scabbard, then he saw that it was a hook sword, of the sort that came from Asia. Those things didn’t really holster well.…</p><p>He also saw the kanji characters etched onto the blade.</p><p>“Magic sword?”</p><p>Bobby shook his head.</p><p>“Nah, just a fancy label. The characters just mean ‘Pierce the heart of the dragon.’”</p><p>“How do you know?” John asked.</p><p>In response, Bobby reeled off several phrases in what sounded like Japanese.</p><p>“Oh,” John said lamely. He should have known better than to assume that there was something Bobby didn’t know. “I’m guessin’ you just told me to screw off and die,” he added.</p><p>“Somethin’ like that,” Bobby replied, grinning. “And that’s all you got to do—run this through the heart of the dragon. End of story—at least for now.” Then the grin fell. “Look, I’ll take a gander at the Impala’s engine, get her good as new while you’re gone.”</p><p>“How’m I supposed to get there? Especially with that.” He gestured at the sword.</p><p>“Take a plane,” Bobby said. “I’ll ship the sword, and it’ll be there waiting when you arrive in San Francisco.”</p><p>“Okay, that could work.” John hadn’t thought of that. But then again, Bobby had a legitimate and regular source of income. Just buying a plane ticket and shipping stuff you couldn’t get through airline security tended to be outside of John’s budget. He was struggling enough just to keep the Impala going, especially with gas over a dollar a gallon.</p><p>Bobby explained that Doragon Kokoro was the spirit of a ronin that had been brought back by a half-Chinese, half-Japanese man named Albert Chao. A spell had been cast by a hunter—from what Bobby heard, it was a man named Jack Bartow—that banished the spirit for twenty years. And that was exactly two decades back.</p><p>“What happened to the hunter who cast the spell?”</p><p>“Bartow? He died later on, savin’ a couple from a vengeance spirit that was hauntin’ ‘em. I met him right after I started in the business, and he left me a bunch of his stuff—including this.”</p><p>With that he hefted the sword.</p><p>“Where’d he find it?” John asked.</p><p>“Got it from a fella at Berkeley, in the Oriental Studies Department. Guy helped Bartow out twenty years ago, along with a couple of other hunters, then came across this and figured Bartow would know what to do with it when Doragon Kokoro came back. Now we got us some dead folks in Chinatown, burned to a crisp and cut to ribbons.”</p><p>“Chinatown?” John rubbed his stubble-covered chin. “I thought this was a Japanese spirit.”</p><p>“It is—like I said, Chao’s a half-breed. Don’t know much beyond that.” Then he peered intently at his friend. “You sure you wanna do this? I can probably head on down to Harvelle’s, find someone who could handle it. Couple days won’t make that much difference.”</p><p>John didn’t answer at first. Instead, he looked over at Dean and Sam in the dining room, playing that oh-so-common game of “I touched you last.”</p><p>Christmas was coming up, and he did want to spend it with the boys.…</p><p>But if all that was needed was for this sword to penetrate the Heart of the Dragon—like it said on the blade—then the job would only take a couple of days. He’d be back in plenty of time.</p><p>“Burned to a crisp, you said.”</p><p>Then the image came back into his head.</p><p>His wife Mary, pinned to the ceiling, blood pooling outward from her stomach, fire surrounding and consuming her.</p><p>He’d dedicated his life to finding out who or what did that. True, he had other reasons for hunting—people were dying at the hands of monsters that most refused to believe really existed.</p><p>At the age of eighteen, John Winchester had been drafted by the U.S. Marine Corps, but had gone willingly, because he believed what his superiors in the Corps taught him: that being a Marine would save lives. A year in Vietnam had cured him of that notion, but the urge was still there.</p><p>Yet the saving of lives was like a side benefit. Because when he did return from ‘Nam, he did so with but a single thought: I want to spend the rest of my life with Mary Campbell. And for ten years he did, until that thing—demon, monster, whatever it was—took her away from him.</p><p>No, his true reason for hunting—the reason that drove him, day in and day out—was to find out what had killed his wife and destroy it once and for all.</p><p>Perhaps the Heart of the Dragon would provide another clue to where he could find it, and finally achieve the vengeance for which his heart had cried out for the past six years.</p><p>John turned to Bobby with renewed resolve.</p><p>“So what time’s my flight?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tommy Shin really hated having to deal with the Old Man.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t really have much of a choice. The Old Man still commanded respect among the people with whom he did business. There was simply no way Tommy would be able to keep his crack cocaine supplier without the Old Man’s help. And there wasn’t a person in Chinatown who didn’t owe the Old Man a favor.</p><p>So Tommy put up with him—but only because he had no choice.</p><p>Some day, he promised himself, he’d finally have the respect he deserved, and be able to put the Old Man out to pasture. For now, though, he needed him.</p><p>Especially with everything else that was going on.</p><p>Tommy called the Old Man into his office, which was located above the Shin’s Delight restaurant on Pacific Avenue in San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood. As usual, the Old Man sneered at him as he walked in. When this had been the Old Man’s office, it was decorated with paintings and artifacts from China.</p><p>But Tommy hadn’t liked that. So when the office became his, he put up framed posters instead—of movies like Batman and Lethal Weapon 2 and bands like REM and Public Enemy. He had even repainted the walls.</p><p>Tourists expected a Chinese restaurant to have red walls with gold trim, and it didn’t do to alienate the tourists—not as long as they had money. But Tommy had insisted that his office be redone in black. He’d read a magazine article about how dark walls made people nervous, and Tommy liked people to be nervous when they were in his presence.</p><p>Now the Old Man looked at the movie and music posters with that disdain of his, then he turned it on Tommy.</p><p>While the Old Man’s paper-white hair was done in an ordinary bowl-cut, Tommy had his moussed and spiked; and where the Old Man wore traditional Chinese garments, Tommy had on a white linen jacket, with the sleeves rolled three-quarters up his arm, over a dark-blue polo shirt with the collar turned up.</p><p>“You continue to disrespect our traditions.”</p><p>That was what the Old Man always said when he saw Tommy, and he said it in Mandarin, of course.</p><p>Tommy’s response was just as rote, though he spoke in English.</p><p>“Those traditions remain in China. We’re in America now. We should act like it.”</p><p>The Old Man sat in the guest chair across from Tommy and continued to speak in Mandarin.</p><p>“I assume that you didn’t summon me here so I could remind you what an imbecile you are.”</p><p>Smiling, Tommy decided to indulge the Old Man and continue the conversation in Mandarin.</p><p>“Not that I don’t enjoy it, but yes, there is a reason.” He opened the top drawer of his desk and retrieved a manila folder. Handing it to the Old Man, he said, “We have a problem. I could use your advice on how to fix it.”</p><p>Taking the folder, the Old Man snorted.</p><p>“Now you wish for my advice?”</p><p>“I always want your advice on things that matter,” Tommy said, still smiling. Then he let the smile fall, for this was serious business. “Three of my lieutenants are dead. That is a copy of the police file—I got it from my cop on the inside.”</p><p>“Why do you take such absurd risks?” the Old Man asked. “The police are not to be trusted.”</p><p>“I pay this one good money to provide me with intelligence,” Tommy said with a scowl. “It’s useful.”</p><p>“It’s a waste of money. The police know nothing of our ways, so they cannot enforce their laws on our people. By adopting their ways, you make it easier for them to complicate our operations. And by putting one on your payroll, you risk discovery.”</p><p>Tommy leaned forward, his hands flat on the wooden desk.</p><p>“Profits are up since I took over, and the only arrests have been of low-level workers who know nothing of consequence. I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>Now the Old Man smiled.</p><p>“Then why do you need my help?”</p><p>Tommy leaned back into his chair.</p><p>“Read the file.”</p><p>The Old Man finally opened the manila folder, looked through it, and grimaced.</p><p>Tommy had had much the same reaction when he first heard about the deaths of Teng, Li, and Lao. Whoever killed them had overdone it: broiling them and cutting them up. Lao’s body had been found by Tommy himself in an alley behind the restaurant. The sight had made him ill, and the subsequent vomiting had ruined a very nice pair of moccasins.</p><p>“Someone,” Tommy said as the Old Man closed the folder, “is going to a great deal of trouble.”</p><p>The Old Man nodded.</p><p>“This is more than simply killing several of your lieutenants. If it was just a bullet to the back of the head, I would expect that they had done something idiotic. But this.…” The Old Man sighed. “This is a power play by someone who has access to considerable resources.”</p><p>Frustrated, Tommy threw up his hands.</p><p>“What kind of ‘resources’ could accomplish this?”</p><p>“Ones not of this world,” the Old Man said, “but the next.”</p><p>Tommy rolled his eyes.</p><p>“That’s absurd.”</p><p>“Really? Did you actually read the report your policeman friend supplied?”</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>The Old Man opened the folder to a particular page and shoved it forward on the desk.</p><p>“See this medical examiner’s report? The bodies had third-degree burns evenly distributed, yet there was no sign of fire anywhere near the corpses. The bodies were too fragile to be moved.”</p><p>“So?” Tommy asked, wondering what difference any of that made.</p><p>“So, you young idiot, these deaths were not natural.”</p><p>Tommy laughed.</p><p>“Then what, they’re super-natural?”</p><p>“Do not mock me,” the Old Man said gravely. “You are too young to remember, but this has happened before. Several citizens of Chinatown were killed in just such a manner, twenty years ago. Rumor had it that the Heart of the Dragon was responsible. It is possible that he has returned.”</p><p>Tommy rolled his eyes once again.</p><p>“That’s just a fairy tale! I heard about that evil spirit when I was a teenager. It was stupid then, and it’s stupid now.”</p><p>The Old Man shrugged.</p><p>“Mock it if you wish,” he said. “They are your lieutenants being killed, so what does it matter? But it is obvious that someone has summoned the Heart of the Dragon once again. And it is just as obvious that you must find that person, and kill him before he kills you.”</p><p>With that, the Old Man got up from his chair. Pausing once to sneer at the image of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover on the poster near the door, he turned and gave Tommy one last parting shot.</p><p>“You think you’re better than me,” he said, “but you’re just a fool who got lucky.”</p><p>Tommy shook his head in disgust, but didn’t bother to reply. He stabbed a finger at the intercom that would put him in touch with the foyer outside the office, where his one surviving lieutenant—Benny Hao—was waiting.</p><p>“Get in here,” he said in English.</p><p>Hao, broad-shouldered, well-muscled and imposing, strode into the room.</p><p>“Yeah, boss?”</p><p>“Tell Mai-Lin to find out whatever she can about ‘the Heart of the Dragon.’”</p><p>For a brief instant, Benny laughed, then he saw that Tommy wasn’t sharing in the humor, and stopped.</p><p>“You sure, boss?” he asked tentatively. “I thought that was just a story.”</p><p>“Maybe—but I want to be certain.”</p><p>“Uh, okay.” He started for the door, then turned. “Oh, and Al’s outside.”</p><p>“What does he want?” Tommy snarled.</p><p>“Said he had an appointment.”</p><p>Just as he was about to tell Benny to shoot Al in the head, Tommy recalled that he had, in fact, made the appointment—he’d just forgotten about it in the chaos surrounding the deaths.</p><p>“Shit,” he spat. “Fine, send the little twerp in.”</p><p>Nodding, Benny left the room.</p><p>Al came in a moment later, wearing a polo shirt, jeans, and moccasins of the same type as Tommy. His shoulder-length dark hair was tied back into a tiny ponytail.</p><p>“What do you want?” Tommy asked impatiently. He could hear Benny on the phone in the foyer, talking to Mai-Lin.</p><p>“I wanted to talk to you about my ideas for improving the collection taking.”</p><p>Tommy blinked in confusion.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“We’ve been having problems with the collections of the protection money, and I think I know why. We always collect on the first day of the month.”</p><p>Tommy couldn’t believe he was having this conversation.</p><p>“Al, I don’t know if you’ve been paying attention, but a bunch of our people are dead.”</p><p>“Uh, okay. I just—“ Al cleared his throat, and pressed on. “When we collect on the first day of the month, usually the owners have already deposited all their cash into their bank accounts, so claim they don’t have any in the till. If we do all the collections on the first Saturday of every month, it’ll work better. The banks are closed on Saturday, so the owners can’t say they don’t have the cash.”</p><p>As pissed as he was at being interrupted, Tommy had to concede that it wasn’t a bad idea. Taking protection money on the first of the month was one of the Old Man’s policies, and Tommy had continued it out of habit.</p><p>But he was more than happy to get rid of another outmoded notion.</p><p>Now, however, was not the time.</p><p>“Al, it’s a good idea, but not now, okay? We’ll do this next week.”</p><p>Al looked deflated, but nodded.</p><p>“All right, boss.”</p><p>The man turned to leave, but Tommy stopped him.</p><p>“Hey, you ever hear anything about something called ‘the Heart of the Dragon?’”</p><p>Albert Chao just shrugged.</p><p>“Nope—never heard of it.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>John looked around at the room he’d been given at the Emperor Norton Lodge on Ellis Street. It had probably been a nice hotel once, but the décor looked like it was straight out of the 1960s. Were John still a teenager, that would have been fine, but times had changed, and the flower-power wallpaper and garish carpet just didn’t feel right.</p><p>The place even had a rotary phone; John hadn’t realized there were any of those left.</p><p>Still, it was cheap, and that was what really mattered.</p><p>It had been all right at first. He and Mary had saved plenty of money—okay, so it was originally earmarked for Dean and Sammy’s college funds, but that was less of a priority now—so after she died, he’d been able to finance his hunt for vengeance.</p><p>But he’d had no idea it would take this long. A year or two, maybe, but not the six years he’d already spent. And there was no end in sight.</p><p>Which meant he’d been progressively downgrading the type of hotel he was willing to stay in. Besides, cheap places like this were less intrusive, and the staff asked fewer questions.</p><p>The money he saved on lodging went to weapons and ammo and other equipment. Not to mention food, gas for the Impala, and paying for that storage unit in upstate New York.</p><p>Sooner or later, the bank account was going to run dry. But John was already practicing a few tricks that would enable him to keep going.…</p><p>One advantage to this particular dump was its proximity to Chinatown, where the three murders he knew of had taken place.</p><p>As promised, Bobby’s package was waiting for him upon arrival, and he set it down on the rickety desk that stood against one wall of the room.</p><p>Just a day earlier, Dean had helped him put the package together. Dean tended to wield Bobby’s tape gun like it was a weapon, which John had found at once charming and unfortunate. He knew that the boys needed to know how to defend themselves. Even if they found the thing that killed Mary, he doubted it would end there.</p><p>John knew too much about how the world really worked, Dean was starting to learn, as well—and it wouldn’t be long before Sammy would find out, though John still held out some hope that his six year-old might have something resembling a normal life.</p><p>If he could find Mary’s killer soon.</p><p>Yet as he brought the heavy package into the hotel room, he wondered if the quest would ever end.</p><p>He thought about the Heart of the Dragon as he ripped the box open, and the fact that the hunter who had stopped it before—this Bartow guy—had died. John would never be able to find out what he knew. And that raised a disturbing possibility that he tried not to think about too much.</p><p>What if some other hunter had come along and killed the thing that took Mary away? John would never even know. It wasn’t as if there was a hunter’s newsletter or anything, and the folks at places like the Roadhouse weren’t exactly forthcoming with details of their hunts. Boasts, yes, tall tales, certainly, but actual solid information was hard to come by.</p><p>So someone might have killed the thing that took Mary, and no one would ever know. Monsters didn’t generally provide resumés of their previous kills.</p><p>There was a very real chance that John’s hunt was entirely pointless.</p><p>But it didn’t matter. Because he couldn’t stop on the basis of a random possibility. He needed to find what had killed Mary, and destroy it. Until that day, there would be no respite.</p><p>One of the most important lessons Daniel Elkins had taught him was that the first step of any hunt was to gather information. It was something of a miracle that John hadn’t gotten himself killed in his first few months of hunting, because what he hadn’t known back then could fill volumes.</p><p>So his next step was to visit the San Francisco Public Library’s main branch at the Civic Center. He took the bus there, since his car was back in South Dakota, and that gave him the opportunity to see the City by the Bay.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of what he saw was construction— right up to and including the Main Library itself. The Bay Area had been hit by a brutal earthquake in October— ironically right in the midst of the first World Series between the Oakland A’s and the San Francisco Giants. While nowhere near as devastating as the famous 1906 quake, there had been a lot of damage, and the city was still in the process of rebuilding.</p><p>When the quake hit, John had actually been at the Roadhouse watching what was supposed to be the third game of the Series with some fellow hunters. The Roadhouse owners, Ellen and Bill Harvelle, had planned it all out: for the duration of the ‘89 Series, the place would—for once—be run like a normal sports bar, with guys drinking beer and talking about Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, and about Will Clark and Rick Reuschel, and about the death of the commissioner, and all sorts of other things that hunters normally didn’t have the time or energy to think about.</p><p>But then while the players warmed up for the third game, the earth shook. Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver turned from sports announcers to newscasters.</p><p>Immediately the patrons of the Roadhouse tried to figure out what kind of omen this might be, what the signs were, and what they might have missed. But it soon became apparent that no mystic forces were involved—it was just the San Andreas Fault with a case of the hiccups.</p><p>Now, as he got off the bus, John realized that he had no idea who actually won that Series.</p><p>To his relief, the section of the Main Library that included recent newspapers was still open to the public, and wasn’t among the areas closed off for post-quake repairs. He immediately started digging through all the local papers, trying to find out everything he could about the three murders.</p><p>But the stories themselves didn’t offer much, although the Chronicle had managed to locate pictures of the victims from before their deaths. They were all Chinese-Americans, they were all employed by the Shin’s Delight restaurant— and they all had tattoos on their forearms.</p><p>While the quality of the black-and-white photos was sufficiently poor that John couldn’t make out what the tattoos depicted, he could tell that they were of the same design—whatever it might be—and in the same place. These days, ornate tattoos were mostly the purview of bikers, Marines, and gangsters—John had the same tattoo on his forearm that all the members of Echo 2/1 boasted.</p><p>Chinese-American biker gangs weren’t really the norm.</p><p>He also checked the sports sections from late October. The A’s had swept the Series in four games.</p><p>Go team.</p><p>When he got back to the hotel, John made a phone call to Lucas Jackson, a fellow Marine who’d gone to work for the VA after serving his tour. He left a message asking if there were any Marine veterans named Jack Teng, Michael Li, or Johnny Lao.</p><p>While waiting for that phone call to come back, John went to the hotel gym. It was a pitiful affair, with only a few weights and one of those stairmaster things, but it would do.</p><p>One of the great vampire hunters Daniel Elkins had been an invaluable storehouse of information about the supernatural. He had urged John to follow his example and keep a journal, so that if he died, it would provide Sam and Dean with a roadmap on how to continue his work.</p><p>It was astonishing how little John knew of those who had come before him. Bobby had reinforced that need with his own account of how he got into hunting. Like John, Bobby had lost his wife. And like John, Bobby had no idea who or what it was that had taken her from him.</p><p>But where John’s first instinct was to fight—no doubt born of his Marine training—Bobby’s was to learn. He had sworn that he would never fail someone due to ignorance.</p><p>John had taken both men’s lessons to heart.</p><p>He had also embraced the lessons the Marines had taught him, which included the idea that it was never good to be idle. As Sergeant Lorenzo had always said, “You’re only as strong as the last guy who kicked your ass.”</p><p>So he worked out with the weights while he waited for Lucas to call back.</p><p>By the time he returned to the room, sweaty and sore—but the good kind of sweaty and sore—the message light was blinking on the room’s rotary phone. Picking it up, he dialed zero.</p><p>“Front desk.”</p><p>“This is Room 220. There’s a message for me?”</p><p>“Uh, yes, sir.” John heard the man shuffle through some papers. “It’s from Lucas Jackson. The message is, ‘no soap.’”</p><p>John smiled.</p><p>Back in country, Lucas had never gotten tired of telling the awful, ‘No soap, radio’ joke, mostly to new recruits who didn’t get it—because, of course, there was nothing to get. That proved to John that it was really Lucas returning the call, and also that he hadn’t found any records for the three dead men.</p><p>Which wasn’t a surprise. Still, he’d needed to be sure.</p><p>So they were gangsters.</p><p>Stripping off the t-shirt and shorts he’d worn to the gym, he took a quick shower, then changed into the warmer clothes he’d need to go outside in San Francisco in December.</p><p>Time, he thought, for a nice dinner at Shin’s Delight.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The second-best day of Albert Chao’s life had been when Tommy Shin took over as the official of this branch of the Triads.</p><p>The best, of course, had been the day Moondoggy Verlander had completed the spell that would allow Albert to summon the Heart of the Dragon. Nothing before that—and nothing since—had matched the sheer magnificence of having such power.</p><p>He needed to get that power back.</p><p>While it had healed his wounds, and continued to do so, without the presence of the spirit itself his greatest weapon remained maddeningly out of reach. Until the spell that banished the spirit wore off, true power would be denied him.</p><p>He couldn’t be hurt or killed—though, for some reason, he continued to age. The spell kept him from permanent harm by healing any injury to his person—though the graver the injury, the longer it took for him to recover.</p><p>And invulnerability wasn’t the same as having the ability to hurt people. Once he realized that, Albert took advantage of the kung-fu craze of the early 1970s, when martial arts dojos were opening up all over the place, filled with students all eager to be the next Bruce Lee. There his rapid healing gave him a distinct advantage, and he quickly developed the fighting skills he needed.</p><p>As soon as Albert felt they were sufficiently honed, he offered himself up to the local Triad group. At first he was refused, but he persisted, and found a branch that would have him.</p><p>Growing up in Chinatown, he had always known how much of the power in his community was wielded by the Triads. So he committed himself to working his way up the Triad ladder, and did so for the next two decades.</p><p>Unfortunately, he spent most of that time on the bottom rung. His status as a half-breed—as usual—was a frustrating impediment.</p><p>Eventually, however, he was permitted to work as a low-level enforcer. He acted as a bodyguard for the prostitutes, minded the door at the clubs, and occasionally took care of people who didn’t pay their protection money or repay their loans.</p><p>Never, however, was he permitted to express an opinion. Half the time, they wouldn’t even let him speak.</p><p>That all changed, though, when Tommy Shin took over from the Old Man.</p><p>* * *</p><p>No one had any idea why the Old Man chose to retire. The announcement came out of the blue, and he seemed deeply unhappy about it. Rumor had it that the higher-ups back in China were displeased with something the Old Man had done, and had made it clear that new blood was required.</p><p>Tommy considered himself an American who happened to live in Chinatown, rather than a Chinese who happened live in America. And he did something nobody else in the Triad hierarchy would do: he spoke directly to Albert.</p><p>“This is the land of opportunity,” Tommy had said then. Albert was pretty sure Tommy hadn’t cared who he was talking to—he just liked to hear the sound of his own voice. But that didn’t matter—what mattered was that it was Albert who was standing there.</p><p>The television was on, and it was tuned to a newscast. There were people in East Germany climbing over the Berlin Wall, unopposed by the security forces that months earlier would have shot them for even attempting such a thing.</p><p>“We can’t let ourselves be tied down to old ways of doing things,” Tommy continued. “Look at that—the Iron Curtain doesn’t even exist anymore. Who’d have believed that any of us would live to see that? So yeah, Albert, I want to hear what you have to say, because the fact that your mother was Japanese isn’t a good enough reason not to listen to you.”</p><p>That was all he needed to hear.</p><p>Now, a month later, Albert had moved up in the ranks. Tommy talked to him, and, reluctantly, so did the others— because Tommy did.</p><p>Which was good, because that was only step one of the plan.</p><p>Step two came on the penultimate new moon of the year, November 28. That was when the spell cast by that stupid blonde gaijin girl finally expired, and Albert once again commanded the Heart of the Dragon.</p><p>Once again he spoke the words, and once again the flames erupted—flames that didn’t burn the surroundings, yet emitted waves of intense energy. Albert basked in the glow of that power, and planned his next move.</p><p>His original plan had been to simply kill everyone who stood in his way, then take control of the Triads, but he hadn’t counted on it taking quite so long to advance in the organization.</p><p>Plus his years working for the Old Man—and then for Tommy—had illustrated the fact that it took more than sheer power. Yes, it helped to wield such a magnificent weapon, but a genuine leader also needed to command respect, and no spell could grant that.</p><p>Albert did not have the respect of his peers, nor of the Triad masters back in China. He would not yet be accepted as the new commander, regardless of the magical resource he now controlled.</p><p>But he could systematically eliminate Tommy’s support system, leaving the Triad boss with only one man he could rely on: Albert Chao. When that day arrived, only Tommy would stand between Albert and the seat of power. It would only be a matter of time before he controlled this branch, and eventually all of the Triads.</p><p>He had to be patient, and methodical. His training at the dojo had instilled that in him.</p><p>Tommy had called him in for a meeting, so he entered through the restaurant. Albert was hoping it was about his collection proposal. The shop owners were always looking for ways to wriggle out of paying protection money, and Albert’s solution, while simple, would solve those problems.</p><p>He’d just timed it poorly.</p><p>As he entered the restaurant, he scanned the tables out of habit from his days as a bodyguard. The vast majority of the patrons were locals, with only one or two round-eyed tourists who had made the effort to dig deeper and find a more authentic eatery.</p><p>Then there was the man with the stubble. He was wearing a Sony walkman, eating his dumplings with a pair of chopsticks that he wielded with surprising ease for an American. Looking more closely, Albert saw dogtags around the man’s neck. Given his age, he’d probably served in Vietnam and learned how to use chopsticks there.</p><p>As Albert walked past, the man looked up sharply. Then he stopped the tape in his walkman and rewound it.</p><p>Albert made a quick detour to Lin, the maître d’.</p><p>“Keep an eye on the man at table seven,” he whispered. “I don’t like the look of him.”</p><p>Lin just stared at him.</p><p>“He’s a paying customer.”</p><p>“Yeah, but he looks like a cop,” Albert said. The SFPD, he knew, was full of guys who had served in the military.</p><p>“Lotta cops in here since Jack, Mike, and Johnny died,” Lin persisted. “Maybe he just likes the dumplings.”</p><p>Albert scowled at him and headed toward the back, to talk to Tommy.</p><p>He’d been trying to figure out who the Heart of the Dragon’s next victim should be, and now he was pretty sure it was going to have to be Lin.</p><p>While climbing the wooden staircase that led to Tommy’s office, he started whispering the spell.</p><p>John cursed himself for his obviousness, but he couldn’t help looking up sharply when his electromagnetic field detector—which looked like a normal Sony walkman— started spiking.</p><p>The person the EMF was responding to, a man with a pointed nose and dark hair tied into a little ponytail, had already been giving John the hairy eyeball, and it only grew more intense when John looked over at him so suddenly.</p><p>John hoped it was just the standard reaction to an American in a place dominated by Chinese—he’d had similar experiences in Vietnam, and had learned the hard way to stick to places that catered to American soldiers. But given the spike, he couldn’t take the chance.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye he saw the guy talking to the maître d’ and gesturing in John’s direction. That pretty much clinched it—he had to assume that he’d been made.</p><p>Which meant that guy might well have been Albert Chao, the one responsible for bringing back the Heart of the Dragon. Bobby hadn’t had a picture, or even a physical description, so he couldn’t be completely sure.</p><p>But he could find out.</p><p>Quickly gulping down the remainder of his dumplings, John shrugged on his bomber jacket, left a ten-dollar bill on the table without bothering to wait for the check—he didn’t want to lose time—grabbed the large mailing tube from under the table, and headed for the exit.</p><p>The maître d’ didn’t even acknowledge John’s departure. He wasn’t sure if that was a good sign or not. Bobby had mentioned that Chao was a half-breed, and that was a type that full-blooded Chinese often ignored, so John might have caught a break.</p><p>Once out on Pacific Avenue, John turned and went into the alley that ran between Shin’s Delight and a souvenir shop. To his relief, the alleyway was open—many large cities these days had taken to gating them to keep out homeless people.</p><p>He reached the back of the building, where three dumpsters contained all the restaurant’s garbage. The stench of rotting food assaulted his nose, but he didn’t let it slow him down—he’d smelled far worse over the past six years. Along the way, he stepped in brackish water that simply joined the dozens of other unidentifiable stains already present on his hiking boots.</p><p>Once he got past the third dumpster, he found a large metal door that was covered in chipped brown paint the same color as the bricks. Using the trash receptacles to hide himself from street view—not that many people were staring down the alley, in any case—he removed the hook sword from the mailing tube.</p><p>The door had two locks, one on the knob, and a deadbolt above it. Trying the knob, he found that it turned all the way, so it wasn’t locked—but the door didn’t budge, which meant the deadbolt was in place.</p><p>Reaching into the inner pocket of his jacket, John pulled out the lockpicks that had been a gift from Caleb two years earlier. Well, half a gift—the other half had been showing him how to use them. After eighteen months, he finally started getting the hang of it.</p><p>After a few moments of fiddling, the tumblers dropped into place.</p><p>Turning the knob, John had to yank to get it open, and cursed silently at the sound it made. As he did so, he held up the sword in a ready position.</p><p>But there was nobody there. Just a dark hallway that led along the back of the building.</p><p>Slowly stepping inside, John closed and locked the door behind him—it wouldn’t do for someone to notice anything amiss—then waited for his eyes to adjust to the dark. There was a light somewhere down the hall, providing him with some illumination. He almost tripped over a couple of giant Hefty bags filled with refuse that hadn’t made their way out to the dumpsters yet. The walls were covered in cracked wooden paneling.</p><p>He could hear chatter in Chinese, coming from the direction of the light, and the crackling sound of oil frying. He moved slowly and silently toward the sounds, and found an entryway to the kitchen, as well as a spiral staircase that went up to the second floor.</p><p>Dozens of people dressed in dirty white uniforms moved about the kitchen, the chatter and the cooking creating a constant stream of sound, enough that the kitchen staff didn’t notice John moving quickly up the staircase.</p><p>The stairs emptied out onto another hallway with similar wood paneling, but in better shape. One wall boasted pictures in both black-and-white and color, showing various people on streets that could’ve been here in Chinatown, or in China itself. Closer inspection, however, revealed the flower-lined twists and turns of Lombard Street visible in the background.</p><p>The other wall had three closed doors and one open one. As he slowly moved down the corridor, staying close to the wall to avoid creaking floorboards, John heard two voices. Both, to his surprise, were speaking English.</p><p>Moving closer, John could start to make out the conversation.</p><p>“I understand,” one of them said, “but we still have to consider—“</p><p>“Right now, Al, the only thing I’m ‘considering’ is how to kill whoever’s responsible for this. I’ve lost three good lieutenants, and someone needs to pay for that!”</p><p>“Of course, Tommy, I understand, but we also have to make sure that business as usual goes on.”</p><p>John had a suspicion it had been ‘Al’ who had set off the EMF spike and given him the evil eye, since that matched the first name Bobby had given him.</p><p>Before he could act, though, he heard a piercing scream from the direction of the large wooden staircase at the far end of the hall—followed by dozens more screams, all emanating from the restaurant below.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lin Sun loved his job.</p><p>It was a simple job, one that didn’t require a great deal of effort, but which allowed him to talk to people. Lin had always been what Americans referred to as a “people person.”</p><p>As a boy he’d come to San Francisco with his family, and immediately started making friends. Unlike his older brother and younger sister—who were reserved at best, chronically shy at worst, just like Mother, Father, and Grandfather—Lin got along with everyone he met.</p><p>As he’d grown, he’d hoped for a career working with people. Perhaps as a librarian, or something else that involved serving the public.</p><p>But he quickly realized that what he hoped for made no difference, especially once he became old enough to learn the truth about why his parents had uprooted them from China.</p><p>The Triads had done Mother and Father a favor. To repay the favor, they had been forced to move to San Francisco and promise that all three of their children would serve under a boss known only as “the Old Man.”</p><p>For his sister, Lien, that meant serving as a hostess at one of the brothels. To Father’s relief, she was not asked to be a prostitute. All she had to do was bring drinks, and occasionally let a customer buy her a drink.</p><p>For his brother, it meant being a personal errand boy for the Old Man.</p><p>Lin was grateful that the Old Man had actually met the children before giving them their assignments within the gang, because as soon as he did so, he recognized that Lin had a gift for talking to people. Thus, by the time he was sixteen, he was a waiter in one of the Triads’ restaurants, eventually working his way up to maître d’.</p><p>That meant that he got to spend every day talking to people, greeting them, seating them, making sure they were enjoying their meals, and simply reveling in meeting other members of the human race.</p><p>Every day he recognized that his lot could have been much worse. His brother, Quan, had been killed in a drive-by shooting just last year. And while Lien wasn’t forced to sleep with her customers, her life was a grim one, and not likely to get any better.</p><p>Lin didn’t think very highly of Tommy Shin. The Old Man had kept things running smoothly, but Tommy kept trying to change things for their own sake, regardless of whether or not they worked. It was as if his only concern was not doing things the way the Old Man had done them, regardless of whether it was the right way or not.</p><p>Even worse, he let half-breeds like Albert Chao work for him, and move up in the ranks. That may have been acceptable to Americans, who had no proper sense of racial identity, but for true Chinese like Lin and his family such practices were not to be encouraged—certainly not by rewarding mongrels with positions of power.</p><p>As a result, Lin hadn’t bothered to “keep an eye” on the stubble-covered American who’d been dining with his headphones on. He’d assumed that the man was listening to what passed for American music—all of it too loud for Lin’s taste—and remained oblivious to all that was happening around him. Or maybe he was just impolite. Lin had come to expect that from Americans, though he hadn’t seen as much of it here.</p><p>Shin’s Delight wasn’t included in most of the guidebooks, catering as it did to locals rather than tourists, so rarely did any Americans wander in off the street. The ones who made the effort to find the place usually had better manners.</p><p>Regardless, if Chao wanted Lin to keep an eye on the man, then it was clearly a waste of time.</p><p>Besides, he had more important things on his mind. With the deaths of Tommy Shin’s lieutenants, Lin feared that Chao would rise to an even higher position in the Triads, and no good could come of that. There was nothing to be done about it, of course—Tommy wouldn’t listen to a lowly maître d’.</p><p>The most Lin could do was quietly fume about it, standing at the podium near the restaurant’s entrance.</p><p>Suddenly he realized he was sweating. Another thing that annoyed Lin about Tommy was his insistence on keeping the heat turned up whenever the temperature outside dipped in the slightest. That was why Lin liked his position at the podium, it allowed him to enjoy the occasional cool breeze when someone opened the outer door.</p><p>But this was hotter even than Tommy liked it. Wondering where the unusual waves of heat might be coming from, Lin turned around—</p><p>—and found himself facing the most horrific sight he’d ever experienced.</p><p>There was a man standing in a column of fire that climbed upward toward the ceiling. Already only a few feet away, the man moved toward him and raised a sword wreathed in flames.</p><p>Lin couldn’t scream.</p><p>Couldn’t breathe.</p><p>Couldn’t move.</p><p>He was transfixed by the fire that surrounded the man, and by his horrible eyes.…</p><p>Hook sword held at the ready, John took the stairs two at a time and ran into the main part of the restaurant. He registered several things in a single glance.</p><p>First, the restaurant’s patrons were screaming, pointing, shouting, and tripping over tables and chairs trying to get away from something, even though the source of their terror was blocking the only exit.</p><p>Second was the maître d’, who was standing stunned while everyone around him was panicking.</p><p>And third was a samurai encircled by fire wielding a flaming katana.</p><p>That’s new, he mused.</p><p>The samurai—which John figured just had to be the Heart of the Dragon—was making a beeline for the maître d’, who remained rooted to the spot.</p><p>John found himself having to shove the panicking patrons out of his way in order to get to the front of the restaurant. The tables were crammed far too close together, and people were literally stepping on one another to get away. Shouts mixed with the piercing sound of shattering glass and porcelain as plates and glasses were knocked onto the floor.</p><p>By the time he reached the front, Doragon Kokoro was practically on top of the maître d’.</p><p>Standing behind the creature, John swung the sword so the hook caught the ronin as if it was a cane yanking a poor performer off a vaudeville stage. But he couldn’t manage to get a grip.</p><p>The spirit didn’t even notice.</p><p>Yanking the sword back, John took another swing, this time at the spirit’s neck.</p><p>The demon whirled around, swinging his flaming sword. John was barely able to duck as the flames singed his hair.</p><p>He only burns his intended target, John realized. He can fry me as easily as he fried his other victims.</p><p>But after that one brief attack, the ronin turned to focus again on his prey.</p><p>However, John’s distraction seemed to have shaken the maître d’ out of his reverie, and caused him to move his ass. With a sudden cry, he bolted through the front door as fast as his feet could carry him.</p><p>John moved swiftly to place himself between Doragon Kokoro and the exit.</p><p>“You ain’t gettin’ past me,” he said, holding the sword in a ready position.</p><p>Through the flickering flames, John could see the patrons continue to scream at one another in Chinese as they tried to escape via the kitchen or the rest rooms. Behind them, at the foot of the same staircase John had run down, he saw Albert Chao standing alongside a young man with spiked hair.</p><p>Chao looked pissed.</p><p>Raising his katana, the Heart of the Dragon swung downward.</p><p>John leaned back, avoiding the flaming blade by a hair’s breadth. The spirit came back with a side thrust. John parried with the hook sword, the clash of metal on metal shaking him so hard he almost lost his grip.</p><p>Tightening his hands around the hilt, John swung once again, this time aiming right for where the ronin’s heart had beaten when he was alive. Bobby had said that the inscription translated to, “Pierce the heart of the dragon,” and maybe it meant exactly that.</p><p>Unfortunately, it did no more good than the other two strikes. The hook sword went straight through, as though what he was fighting was nothing more than flames. Yet the strike of the katana on the hook sword had been quite substantial.</p><p>Again, Doragon Kokoro swung his weapon. Again John raised his own sword to parry.</p><p>He had wielded a sword in the past, during his training as a Marine, but that was primarily for ceremonial functions. Then Caleb had introduced him to a middle-aged woman named Lara, an expert swordswoman with amazingly fast hands. He never forgot the best piece of advice she’d given him.</p><p>“Go on instinct. Don’t think about what you’re doing, just do it!”</p><p>When the Heart of the Dragon attacked, John didn’t think.</p><p>He just acted.</p><p>Each sword strike got closer. Each parry from John came later.</p><p>The thrusts were impossibly strong and never varied. John, on the other hand, was only human, and would tire as the scrap wore on.</p><p>He needed a new plan, since the sword didn’t seem to be doing the trick.</p><p>Then the fires that surrounded the spirit started to dim. Glancing toward the stairs, John saw that Chao was muttering something.</p><p>In a moment, the spirit faded away. The floor beneath it remained untouched.</p><p>A few people were still milling about and John saw that both the spike-haired man and Chao were trying to plow through the chaotic restaurant toward him.</p><p>Not having any desire to answer their questions, John followed the path of the maître d’ out of the door. Luckily, Pacific Avenue was even more packed than the restaurant had been. Tourists of all shapes, sizes, and colors joined the locals to jam the sidewalk. He was able to lose himself in the crowd, doing his best to hide the hook sword beneath his bomber jacket.</p><p>He worked his way to a bus stop—walking gingerly to avoid stabbing himself—knowing that the first thing he needed to do when he got back to the hotel was call Bobby and tell him that his sword was a dud.</p><p>Albert couldn’t believe it. He just couldn’t.</p><p>Everything was going so well, and yet here was some gaijin messing things up—just like those people from twenty years ago. This one even had a sword of some kind.</p><p>Quickly, Albert banished the spirit. There were too many witnesses, and Lin had already run off.</p><p>Unfortunately, the damage had been done. Tommy had run out front, along with two of the waiters, to go after the gaijin.</p><p>Albert, however, stayed behind, so he was able to survey the damage that had been done. He cursed himself for a fool, letting his dislike of Lin overcome his good sense. The point was to wield the Heart of the Dragon with subtlety, to weed out those who stood in his way.</p><p>Lin wasn’t in Albert’s way, he was just an idiot.</p><p>Albert was never going to succeed if he kept making stupid mistakes like that.</p><p>With a sigh, he started walking back through the restaurant, glass and ceramic crunching under his feet. The patrons were starting to calm down, some checking themselves for injuries, all of them whispering breathlessly to one another.</p><p>After a few moments, Albert realized that they were all saying the same thing: that after twenty years, the Heart of the Dragon was back.</p><p>At first he was tempted to shout them all down, tell them they were giving in to superstition and foolishness, but he quickly realized that it would be a mistake. To begin with, they could hardly deny the evidence of their own eyes.</p><p>Besides, since he’d already opened Pandora’s Box, maybe he could use the situation to his benefit.</p><p>Tommy stomped back into the restaurant, bellowing furiously.</p><p>“What the hell was that?”</p><p>“From the looks of it,” Albert said, “that was the Heart of the Dragon. It was trying to kill Lin.”</p><p>“That’s not what I saw,” Tommy said. “It was trying to kill that tourist with the sword.” He smiled then. “For some reason, the Heart of the Dragon was trying to protect us.”</p><p>Then the smile fell.</p><p>“Al, I need you to find out everything you can about this thing—where it came from, what it wants, why it’s helping us. And who the hell it was trying to kill.”</p><p>One of the waiters—Albert couldn’t remember his name—spoke up.</p><p>“Boss, isn’t that the thing that killed Johnny and—“</p><p>“True.” Tommy rubbed his chin. “We need more information. C’mon, Al, you’ve always got ideas—so what is this thing, and what does it want with me? Can you get me some answers?”</p><p>Albert bowed respectfully.</p><p>“Absolutely, Tommy.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Bobby Singer was about to make dinner for himself and the boys when the phone rang. He grabbed his new cordless appliance off the wall-mount and held it up to his ear.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>In response, the phone rang again.</p><p>With a sigh, he held it in front of his face and pushed the “talk” button.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>It was John Winchester.</p><p>“What the hell you tryin’ to pull, Bobby?”</p><p>Now Bobby scowled, wondering why, exactly, he put up with this sort of crap.</p><p>Voices from the living room wafted into the kitchen.</p><p>“Deeeeean! That’s my pen!”</p><p>“So get another pen, Dexter Sammy.”</p><p>He ran his other hand through his thick hair.</p><p>“I ain’t pullin’ a damn thing, John,” he replied, holding his temper as best he could. “What the hell are you talkin’ about?”</p><p>“You send me out here, ship me this sword, and I’m stuck flailin’ around like an idiot. The damned thing doesn’t work.”</p><p>Bobby started to rub his eyes, but noticed that there were tufts of red hair between his fingers. He was starting to go bald, and in his uncharitable moments he blamed it entirely on John.</p><p>“Look, why don’t you go talk to that Berkeley professor that gave Bartow the thing?”</p><p>There was a long pause before he heard John’s reply.</p><p>“What’s his name?”</p><p>“Marcus Wallace.”</p><p>Bobby went into the living room. Dean was standing on his tiptoes and holding his left hand as high in the air as he could—Sam’s pen clutched between his fingers. Sam, for his part, was jumping up into the air trying to grab it from his much taller older brother.</p><p>Shaking his head, Bobby rummaged through the papers on his desk.</p><p>“Hang on—okay, here it is,” he added as he liberated the letter that had been packed away among Bartow’s effects. Finding Wallace’s direct line at the UC-Berkeley campus, he read it off.</p><p>“All right,” John said, “I’ll give him a call. If he doesn’t pan out, though, I’m gonna need to get creative. It’s that, or end up shake-and-baked. I’ll talk to you later, Bobby.”</p><p>“The boys are just fine, by the way,” Bobby said quickly, before John could hang up.</p><p>Lowering his arm, Dean turned toward Bobby.</p><p>“Is that Dad?”</p><p>Sam took advantage of the distraction to snatch the pen from his brother’s hand with a piercing “Ha!” of triumph, but Dean barely noticed.</p><p>John sounded impatient on the other end of the line.</p><p>“I figured they were, since if they weren’t, you’d have said something,” he said. “I need to go, the long-distance charges are murder.”</p><p>With that, he hung up.</p><p>“Can I talk to him?” Dean asked pleadingly.</p><p>Pushing the “talk” button again to close the connection on his end, Bobby let his hand drop to his side.</p><p>“Sorry, Dean, he, uh—was on his way out the door. But he told me to tell you both to behave yourselves and do what I tell you. And that he loves you.”</p><p>Tilting his head, Dean gave Bobby a sidelong glance.</p><p>“Did he really say that?”</p><p>“‘Course he did. So I’m tellin’ you right now, boy—stop stealing from your brother. You need a pen, ask me for one, all right?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Okay. I did all my homework already anyhow.”</p><p>Now it was Bobby’s turn to give Dean a sidelong glance.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Unlike Bobby, the ten year-old boy wilted.</p><p>“Well, most of it.”</p><p>“That’s what I thought. You get it done before I’m finished cookin’, all right?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Dean sat down next to Sam on the couch. Sam had gone back to the homework he’d been working on when Dean stole his pen.</p><p>Dean looked up at Bobby again.</p><p>“Can I have a pen?”</p><p>Bobby grinned.</p><p>“Sure.” He opened the top drawer of his desk and fished out a ballpoint he’d gotten from one of the hotels he’d stayed in during a hunt.</p><p>He handed it over, and headed back into the kitchen.</p><p>“It won’t write!” came the voice of a ten year-old. “This pen sucks!”</p><p>As he went into the fridge for butter to spread onto the pan, Bobby decided it was the entire Winchester family that was making him bald.</p><p>John had imagined that a college professor’s office would be a large room with a grand wooden desk, a leather chair, and walls lined floor-to-high-ceiling with bookcases.</p><p>So when he arrived at the University of California Berkeley campus and went to the building on Fulton Street that housed the recently renamed Asian Studies Department, he was strangely disappointed.</p><p>Marcus Wallace’s office was a tiny rectangle of a room with no windows and less air. A dull gray metal desk sat against one wall, taking up so much space that the professor’s simple leather chair butted against the opposite wall, leaving room only for one small particle-board bookcase in the corner.</p><p>The desk was covered with papers, some of which were precariously stacked in two wireframe in-boxes. Otherwise the desk boasted a phone—on which Wallace was speaking when John entered—and a personal computer screen, though the keyboard had been buried under more papers. Bright green letters glowed from the monitor, shining on the side of Wallace’s face and contrasting oddly with the fluorescent bulb overhead.</p><p>The office’s walls had probably been painted yellow once, but had faded to a dirty mustard.</p><p>Wallace himself was a pleasant-faced man who looked seriously out of place in an Asian Studies Department, with his squared-off Afro that was cut close to the skin at the temples.</p><p>While talking on the phone, he gestured for John to sit in the folding chair crammed between the desk and the wall next to the door.</p><p>“Yes, I understand that, but—“ he said, then fell silent. “Yes, I know that, but— The students aren’t going to—“ More silence, and he was beginning to look pissed off. “Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay, sir. Good-bye.”</p><p>Slamming the phone down with considerable force, Wallace snarled at it for a second, then composed himself.</p><p>“Sorry about that,” he said sincerely. “We just got a new department chairman, and his solution to everything seems to be to change how things’ve been done for the twenty years I’ve been here, whether it’s a good idea or not. Swear to God, man, academic politics makes the folks in Washington look like pikers.” He took a breath and held out his hand. “Sorry— I’m Marcus Wallace. You must be John Winchester.”</p><p>John accepted the firm handshake.</p><p>“I guess you talked to Bobby after we spoke?”</p><p>Wallace nodded.</p><p>“So the hook sword didn’t work as advertised?”</p><p>“That’s an understatement,” John said somewhat bitterly.</p><p>“Take it easy, man—it isn’t Bobby’s fault. Ever since Doragon Kokoro first showed up, some twenty years back, I’ve been trying to find out everything I could. I helped Bartow out, and since then, I’ve been doing research up the yin-yang to try to find out more. But it isn’t easy.”</p><p>He started rummaging through the papers on his desk while he continued.</p><p>“Nevertheless, I think I may have found something that might be of some use. Where is it?” After going through a few more sheafs, Wallace finally found what he was looking for. “Here it is!”</p><p>It was a booklet, about half the size of John’s own journal in breadth and width. At first he thought Wallace was handing it to him upside down and backward, before he remembered that most Asian languages were written right-to-left.</p><p>Flipping through it briefly, John saw the kanji characters, along with some line art that John might have found pretty under better circumstances.</p><p>“What the hell’m I supposed to do with this?” he asked.</p><p>Wallace shook his head quickly and grabbed the booklet back.</p><p>“Sorry, man—I forget sometimes that not everybody reads the language.” He flipped through to a back page. “Here we go.” He handed it back to John and pointed at the drawing that appeared there. “I’m guessing a picture will be worth a few thousand words.”</p><p>Again taking the booklet, John saw line art that took up the entire bottom half of the page: a man holding a very familiar-looking hook sword, crouched in a ready stance facing off against a man who was wreathed in flames while wielding a katana.</p><p>Of particular note to John was that the kanji characters on the hook sword were glowing.</p><p>Looking up, he saw that Wallace was nodding toward the book.</p><p>“If this thing’s the real deal—and I’ve been translating this sucker for a while now—then it isn’t the sword, it’s the engravings.” Turning away, he used his forearm to sweep the papers off the keyboard, and began typing. “I went ahead and wrote out the characters on the sword phonetically for you. The next time you face the spirit, you need to focus your concentration on it and then cast the engraved spell.</p><p>“My guess is that that’ll get rid of Doragon Kokoro.”</p><p>“Your guess?” John didn’t like the sound of that.</p><p>Wallace regarded him levelly.</p><p>“Look, man, you and I both know that this sort of thing doesn’t always come with an instruction manual.”</p><p>With a sigh, John relented.</p><p>“Yeah, okay.”</p><p>Rising to his feet, the professor gestured toward the door.</p><p>“C’mon, the printer’s down the hall.”</p><p>John followed him out of the cramped office and into the cramped hallway to a table that sat next to a bunch of wooden mail slots with people’s names written on small white labels affixed to the front. One of them, John noted, had Wallace’s name, there was an envelope propped up in the slot. The professor nabbed it as they walked past.</p><p>The printer was a daisy-wheel that worked very slowly, but it was still done by the time they arrived. The sheet it spat out contained only a few words.</p><p>Wallace pulled a lever that let loose the paper, and yanked it out.</p><p>“Here you go, Mr. Winchester. Hold the sword near Doragon Kokoro, chant this, and stand back.”</p><p>John took the proffered paper.</p><p>“And if that doesn’t work?”</p><p>Wallace’s face broke into a wry grin.</p><p>“Run like hell?”</p><p>John rolled his eyes.</p><p>“Thanks a lot.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Tommy Shin hated the fact that the Old Man had been right.</p><p>Mai-Lin had followed his instructions and provided him with a dossier of information about the Heart of the Dragon. Tommy didn’t know as much as he’d have liked, but he knew enough to take action.</p><p>To his irritation, one of those actions had to be to talk to the Old Man again. When the Old Man had proposed that a spirit had been responsible for the deaths of his lieutenants, Tommy was barely able to even consider the idea. Now he would be forced to eat his own words.</p><p>But he couldn’t deny the evidence of his own eyes. He’d seen the Heart of the Dragon in the restaurant, saw it advance upon Lin, and saw it disappear as if by magic. So Tommy had to accept that the creature truly existed. Which meant that once again he had to ask the Old Man for help.</p><p>The wild card in all this was the white man with the sword. Tommy had no idea what to make of him—and that didn’t sit well. On the one hand, the gaijin had brought that strange sword into the restaurant. On the other, he’d risked his own life to defend Lin—a perfect stranger.</p><p>Why would he do something like that? Tommy wondered. What does he stand to gain?</p><p>He also seemed to have expected the Heart of the Dragon to appear. Why else would he bring a sword into Shin’s Delight in the first place?</p><p>Still, until he learned more about the man, there was nothing Tommy could do about him. Other preparations, however, could be made—and had been.</p><p>Tommy summoned Benny and Al to his office, and both men showed up almost immediately.</p><p>“Have a seat,” he said, indicating the two guest chairs that sat in front of his desk. “I’ve received a report about the Heart of the Dragon—the flaming warrior—since it appeared in the restaurant downstairs.”</p><p>Al seemed to become agitated.</p><p>“So have I,” he said without waiting to be asked, “and I think it was that ga—uh, that foreigner who summoned it in the first place.”</p><p>Benny turned to peer at him.</p><p>“Why would you think that?” he demanded. “Everyone I spoke to said that he seemed to be fighting it.”</p><p>“It’s obvious!” Al stared back at Benny as if to imply that he was an idiot. “The foreigner came in here carrying a sword! People don’t do that sort of thing unless they plan to use them. I’ll bet he called up the demon so that it would help him with whatever twisted plot he planned to carry out.”</p><p>“Then why fight it as he did?” Benny asked.</p><p>Al shrugged.</p><p>“Who knows? Maybe it got out of control. That would explain why it went after Lin. I mean, Lin isn’t anybody important, after all.” He turned to face Tommy. “No, I think he was after you, and the reason he revealed himself when he did was in order to stop it from killing the wrong person.” He looked very smug at his own reasoning.</p><p>Tommy nodded, considering what had been said.</p><p>“It’s not a bad theory, Al,” he admitted.</p><p>A knock came from the doorway. The door was open, and Mike Zhang—one of the bodyguards from downstairs—was standing there.</p><p>“Excuse me, boss? We got somebody.”</p><p>Tommy waved his hand to indicate that Mike should enter.</p><p>“Come in, come in,” he said eagerly.</p><p>Mike stepped into the office, followed by Jack Wu and an unshaven white man wearing a bomber jacket. Jack stood six-foot-eight, with massive shoulders.</p><p>Mike held up a hand to reveal a hook sword.</p><p>“Well well well,” Tommy said, walking around his desk to face the foreigner, “returned to the scene of the crime, have you?”</p><p>Jack had huge hands with which he held the foreigner’s shoulders in a crushing grip. Despite this, the white man was defiant.</p><p>“I’m not the one who’s committing a crime here,” he said with conviction.</p><p>“Who are you?” Tommy demanded.</p><p>“Name’s John Winchester—and I ain’t here to cause you any harm.”</p><p>At that Al stood up and placed himself next to his boss.</p><p>“You’re lying!” he said in a voice that was a little too high. “You’re trying to destroy the Triads, starting with Tommy, aren’t you? You think he’s weak, but you’re wrong!”</p><p>Winchester just smiled at him. It was a disturbing smile, because it was at once both completely wild and frighteningly sane. This, Tommy quickly realized, was someone who’d stared into the abyss.</p><p>He had seen that look only once before—on the Old Man.</p><p>“There’s only one thing I’m tryin’ to destroy, son, and it’s not in this room.”</p><p>Al turned to Tommy.</p><p>“You should kill him now, before he destroys you!”</p><p>Now it was Tommy’s turn to smile.</p><p>“Oh, I may very well kill him, Al,” he said calmly. “But not because he summoned the Heart of the Dragon.”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Al asked, and the blood drained from his face.</p><p>Tommy started to pace back and forth between the movie posters on the wall.</p><p>“Mai-Lin’s research revealed a great deal about the Heart of the Dragon, including something you left out of your little report,” he said. “You see, the creature is the damned spirit of an ancient warrior, Yoshio Nakadai, and John Winchester here cannot possibly have brought him back to the land of the living. No, that can only be done by a blood relative—a descendent of the ronin.”</p><p>He turned to stare right at Al.</p><p>“Her information was very thorough. And since Yoshio Nakadai was Japanese, there’s only one person I can think of who could possibly qualify. Someone who himself is half-Japanese, and might start to call a foreigner ‘gaijin’ before correcting himself. Someone who has ambitions within the Triads. Someone who never got along with Lin.”</p><p>At first panic swept across Al’s features, and he glanced around the room as if to seek a way out.</p><p>Then his shoulders slumped, and he looked back at his boss.</p><p>“Very well, Tommy. You got me.”</p><p>Before anyone could react, however, he muttered something under his breath.</p><p>Tommy felt the heat warm his face almost instantly.</p><p>There, in the middle of the room, was the Heart of the Dragon, looking just as he had downstairs.</p><p>“How the hell—?” Benny said, rising to his feet and backing away instinctively. He pulled out his Beretta.</p><p>Tommy and his bodyguards were frozen with fear. Winchester, who was still held in Jack’s grip, was the only one who seemed to have kept his wits about him.</p><p>“He must’ve cast most of the spell before he came in here,” he shouted. “What he just said had to’ve ended it.”</p><p>“Very good,” Al smiled, like a teacher praising a clever pupil.</p><p>Benny pulled the trigger three times, but the bullets evaporated instantly in the flames.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon raised his katana.</p><p>Benny was about to shoot Al instead of the creature, but before he could do anything, Winchester started muttering some words of his own in Japanese.</p><p>As he did so, the lettering started to glow on the sword in Mike’s hands.</p><p>Without warning the fiery spirit leaned his head back and screamed, his katana still raised. It was a hollow, agonizing sound—only vaguely human. The fire started to burn brighter, and Tommy had to shield his eyes from the glare.</p><p>Then the flames dwindled to nothing, and the spirit was gone.</p><p>Al cried out in anger.</p><p>Tommy gestured to Benny, who got the idea immediately and pointed his Beretta at Al.</p><p>Winchester moved quickly, however, elbowing Jack hard in the gut, then punching him in the face with the back of his fist. A kick of his booted heel caught Jack in the groin, and as the bodyguard doubled over, Winchester took a swing at Mike. One punch did the trick.</p><p>He always did have a glass jaw, Tommy thought absently. As Mike hit the floor, the Caucasian scooped up his sword.</p><p>Tommy never carried a gun—that was what he had guys like Mike and Jack for. Since Benny was aiming at Al, that freed Winchester to bolt for the door.</p><p>“Boss?” Benny asked, not taking his eyes off Al.</p><p>“Let him go,” Tommy said, having fully regained his composure. “He’s not our enemy. If he comes back, I’ll deal with him then.” He ran a hand through his spiked hair and turned to Al.</p><p>“You, however, I’ll deal with right now.”</p><p>Defiant to the last, though with nowhere near the conviction Winchester had shown, Al responded.</p><p>“Go ahead and do your worst, Tommy. Tell Benny to shoot me.”</p><p>“If you don’t shut up, I will shoot you, you half-breed piece of crap,” Benny said.</p><p>“Like I said, go ahead. I have nothing more to say to you.”</p><p>Tommy considered this.</p><p>“You may believe that, Al, but I don’t. You see, you could be very valuable to me. After all, you know how to summon the Heart of the Dragon.”</p><p>“Not anymore,” Al said bitterly. “That—that gaijin banished the spirit. He’s gone.”</p><p>Shrugging, Tommy gestured to Benny.</p><p>“All right, then, shoot him.”</p><p>With a grin, Benny squeezed the trigger three times, emptying his clip into Al’s chest. He fell to the floor of the office, blood pluming from the wounds.</p><p>Tommy turned his attention to Jack and Mike.</p><p>“You two all right?”</p><p>Jack nodded, looking flushed with embarrassment, but Mike was still insensate on the floor. Benny shook his head as he ejected the clip from his Beretta and replaced it with a new one. It slid into the grip with a solid click.</p><p>Tommy was thinking that he needed to put Mai-Lin on this John Winchester person—find out who he was, and where he came from. Clearly he had considerable knowledge and resources, of the sort Tommy thought he would, perhaps, be able to use.</p><p>He looked at Jack, who was kneeling down next to Mike.</p><p>Mike, in turn, was beginning to regain consciousness. He moaned loudly.</p><p>“Jack, get up and call Doctor Jiang. We’ll need to have him dispose of Al’s body.”</p><p>“Owww!”</p><p>Whirling around, Tommy froze. They all did.</p><p>Al was getting up from the floor.</p><p>Blood still stained the front of his shirt, encircling the holes made by the bullets, but through those holes, Tommy only saw smooth, unbroken skin.</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>Smoothing his clothing as best he could, Al just stared at him, a huge grin appearing on his face.</p><p>“You’re not gonna need Jiang for me, Tommy. And you’re gonna want to keep me around, too. Remember how I said the Heart of the Dragon was banished? Well, one thing I didn’t say was that it would be forever.”</p><p>But before he could continue, Benny shot him again, this time in the shoulder.</p><p>Al stumbled back against the wall, then snarled and reached out to grab the gun from Benny’s grip.</p><p>“Damn it, Benny, that hurts!”</p><p>Even as he pulled the weapon from Benny’s hand, Jack got to his feet and put two bullets in Al’s back, spinning him around. They burst out through his belly, spraying blood all over the Lethal Weapon 2 poster.</p><p>But Al didn’t fall down this time, though he was doubled over when he whirled around, aimed Benny’s Beretta, and shot Jack twice in the chest.</p><p>Jack most definitely did fall over.</p><p>Benny leapt forward, trying to grab the gun back. Four hands wrapped around the Beretta’s grip, fumbling desperately in an attempt to move it one way or the other, fingers trying to slide in to get purchase on the trigger.</p><p>At first they seemed evenly matched. Tommy didn’t dare move closer for fear of getting shot himself. At one point the gun aimed right at him, and he ducked behind his desk.</p><p>Eventually Benny managed to get the upper hand, pushing the barrel against Al’s chest.</p><p>With a deafening report, the weapon fired, and Al screamed.</p><p>Benny smiled. Thinking himself victorious, he relaxed his grip on the Beretta.</p><p>As soon as he did so, Al shoved the gun under Benny’s chin and squeezed the trigger.</p><p>Brain matter and skull fragments splattered across the ceiling, and even as the body hit the floor, Al turned to Tommy. His shirt was shredded now, and completely drenched in blood, but where the skin was broken, the wounds were healing even as Tommy stared.</p><p>The smile that crossed his face now scared Tommy even more than Winchester’s had. There was a madness that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>“All you had to do was give me more authority,” Al said grimly. “That’s why I killed those three idiots— Teng, Li, and Lao. And these two.” Then he turned to Mike, who was still half out of it on the floor, and shot him twice in the back. “And him.</p><p>“None of them were going to help you, Tommy. I could’ve helped you. Now I’m just gonna have to help myself. By the time I’m able to summon the Heart of the Dragon again, I’ll be the most powerful man in Chinatown.”</p><p>Tommy sneered at him the way the Old Man had always sneered at Tommy.</p><p>“You think you’re better than me, but you’re just a fool who got lucky.”</p><p>“And I’m about to get luckier.”</p><p>The last thing Tommy Shin ever heard was the report that sent a bullet into his brain.</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Nakadai met his death at the hands of the demon, the experience was indescribable agony. Yet even as the flames roared, burning his flesh away from the bone, as the fires drove the life from his body, he knew that the demon had a plan that stretched far beyond turning a peaceful town into a bloodthirsty mob.</p><p>The intensity of the pain eventually caused him to lose consciousness—for the final time, he prayed. And once the agony disappeared, there wasn’t anything to replace it, simply a void of nothingness. For the briefest of moments, Nakadai imagined he had found the peace he had sought ever since the dark days of his former master’s disgrace.</p><p>That moment of hope, however, was fleeting.</p><p>The fires that killed him returned. While he did not feel their heat or their destructive power, somehow they transported him back to the land of the living.</p><p>When he arrived, a wizened old woman stood before him.</p><p>“I am Miko,” she said. “You are my great uncle. And you will do as I say.” In her hands she held a hooked sword engraved with runes that spelled out the words “Pierce the heart of the dragon.”</p><p>Try as he might, Nakadai could not speak—not even to verify that this withered crone was indeed the offspring of the pudgy two-year-old nephew he’d known when he lived. Nor could he control his own actions.</p><p>Visible through a haze of fire, the woman who called herself Miko revealed that she had learned of the spell the demon had used to damn him, but the power of her birthright had enabled her to summon him back to the land of the living.</p><p>She spoke of the foreigners who had come to their shores soon after Nakadai’s death, and how their foul ways had corrupted Japan. She told him about her own daughter, who had married a Chinese man and moved across the ocean to the United States, and had given birth to a son.</p><p>That had been the final indignity, and it had spurred Miko to action. Disowning her daughter and cutting her off from all contact with the family, she had proceeded to search the family history, hoping to find something that might grant her the influence needed to turn the tide of corruption. In doing so, she had learned of the spell that had doomed Nakadai.</p><p>She then located masters of the arcane, and studied their arts. They had helped her craft a counter-spell that would return him to the land of the living as a weapon for her to wield. But knowing the dangers that lurked wherever evil was involved, she had set out to have the hook sword forged.</p><p>It was to be kept in reserve, in case the demon returned and attempted to assert control.</p><p>“And now you will help me rid our land of the accursed Western plague,” the ancient woman said, and that was when he realized that her mind had long since given way to insanity.</p><p>“Together we will destroy them, and restore Japan to its noble glory.”</p><p>But the years had ravaged her body as much as her mind, and before Nakadai could perform any of the tasks Miko intended for him, it surrendered to the years and she died.</p><p>Oblivion returned the moment she breathed her last, and blissfully remained until the day that her grandson, Albert Chao, made use of the same spell. This was the half-breed who had so incensed Miko, and at his hands Nakadai was used to fulfill petty revenge fantasies until blessedly, he was banished again at the hands of a Western woman.</p><p>When he returned again eighty seasons later, it was again at the hands of Albert Chao. His descendant had become less petty, but his vicious streak remained, and only Miko’s sword—somehow wielded by a foreigner—kept Nakadai from doing more harm.</p><p>Again he floated in the void, for what he hoped would be an eternity. But even as he did so, he knew the demon would never allow it to be.</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean stood between a fidgety Sammy and a patient Uncle Bobby at the Sioux Falls Airport baggage claim.</p><p>Each time someone new came through the door, his ten year-old heart beat just a little bit faster. And each time it wasn’t Dad, he deflated.</p><p>He just wanted Dad to come back home safe. The safe part, at least, he knew was the case.</p><p>Dad had called Uncle Bobby last night after Dean was supposed to be in bed. But unlike Sammy, he hadn’t been able to sleep. So when the phone rang, he slid out of bed, snuck quietly onto the upstairs landing, and listened to Uncle Bobby’s side of the conversation coming from the kitchen.</p><p>“Good.… Yeah, okay.” He paused while John talked on the other end of the line. “Yeah, I figured Wallace would know his business. What?... Oh yeah, sure. That makes sense. Well, send the sword back, you ain’t gonna want to run that sucker through the metal detector, and I sure as hell wouldn’t trust it to the idjits who handle checked luggage. Be lucky if the damn thing don’t wind up in Outer Mongolia by mistake.…</p><p>“Just charge it to the FedEx account, for cryin’ out loud.… All right. I’ll put it on ice when it gets here, in case we need it again in twenty years. Yeah, we’ll meetcha when the flight lands—I’ll even bring the Impala. It’s runnin’ all nice and smooth now, just needed an oil change and some tunin’.</p><p>“What?... Yeah, I said ‘we.’ I’ll bring the boys along. They wanna see you.… Why shouldn’t I bring ‘em.… Good.…</p><p>“Okay, seeya John.”</p><p>After he’d heard the beep of Uncle Bobby ending the call, Dean had been happy. Dad was alive—and based on the way he and Uncle Bobby had been arguing, he was as ornery as ever.</p><p>That, Dean knew, meant Dad was okay.</p><p>Waiting there in the airport, he understood how important it was for Dad to be away so much—more than Sammy ever could. Sammy hadn’t really known Mom, since he was just a baby when she died. Dean couldn’t imagine that his baby brother would ever truly understand what had happened to her.</p><p>If he was honest with himself, he didn’t really understand it, either. There were some days—though he’d never admit this to anyone—when he couldn’t even remember what she looked like.</p><p>Some kind of monster had killed Mom, and Dad wouldn’t rest until he found that monster and killed it. Along the way, he’d kill any other monsters who tried to kill other people’s moms.</p><p>Because Dad was a hero, and that was what heroes did.</p><p>Finally, a familiar dark-haired head appeared behind a bickering couple. Dad moved past them, walking quickly, a broad smile widening inside his stubble.</p><p>Sammy hadn’t been paying attention to much of anything, but as soon as Dad walked through the door, he jumped up and ran.</p><p>“Daaaaad!”</p><p>“What a baby,” Dean said, and he pretended it was no big deal that Dad was back.</p><p>“You boys doin’ all right?”</p><p>“We’re doin’ great, Dad!” Sammy was practically bouncing up and down. “I beat Dean at checkers and then he won hide-and-seek, but it’s okay ‘cause I beat him at Yahtzee!”</p><p>Dean was about to point out that Sammy only won one game of Yahtzee, but Uncle Bobby put a hand on his shoulder and shook his head.</p><p>Reluctantly, Dean kept quiet. Sammy was happy to see Dad, and Uncle Bobby didn’t want Dean to rain on his parade.</p><p>So all he said was, “Good to see you, Dad.”</p><p>“Glad to see both you boys. Oh, and I’ve got something for ya!” He reached into the pocket of his jacket and pulled out two tiny plastic rectangles, handing one to Sammy with one hand, and reaching toward Dean with the other.</p><p>It was a miniature California license plate, with DEAN where the number would’ve been.</p><p>Sammy’s eyes went wide—his said, SAM.</p><p>“Wow! This is so great!”</p><p>“Can only get ‘em in San Francisco,” Dad said with a smile. “Had to get you boys somethin’ special.”</p><p>Since Sammy was so happy to have his, Dean said nothing.</p><p>But he knew that items like this could be found in lots of places in California. And that airports in particular had souvenir shops that sold them. He’d only gone flying once, and he really really really really hated it, but he remembered those shops.</p><p>Which meant Dad probably grabbed these quickly, on the way to catch the plane. Based on Uncle Bobby’s half of the conversation on the phone last night, he hadn’t even expected his sons to be at the airport.</p><p>Then Dad ruffled Sammy’s hair and walked up to Dean. He put his hands on Dean’s shoulders and gave him one of his most serious expressions, the one he used whenever he was saying something really important.</p><p>“You took good care of Sammy, didn’t ya?”</p><p>Dean swallowed, and suddenly felt incredibly guilty. He remembered, too, the words Dad spoke to him the night Mom died. They were always in his mind, but just now they echoed so very loudly.</p><p>“Take your brother outside as fast as you can—don’t look back.</p><p>“Now, Dean, go!”</p><p>So he straightened his shoulders, and looked his father right in the eye.</p><p>“Yes, sir!”</p><p>Dad smiled. “That’s my boy.”</p><p>“C’mon,” Uncle Bobby said, “let’s get outta here.”</p><p>They walked to the parking lot. Dean got a little steamed when Sammy started going on and on about the one and only time he beat Dean at Yahtzee, but then he thought about Dad’s words and let it go again.</p><p>Dad still fought the bad guys and saved people, but he also cared about his sons.</p><p>Because Dad was a hero, and that was what heroes did.</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Myra Wu ran through Golden Gate Park under the meager light of a crescent moon, desperate for her life.</p><p>Never before had she felt such terror. It clawed at her chest, and wouldn’t let go. Even in her darkest dreams, she couldn’t have imagined such fear could exist.</p><p>Not until the day she’d first heard gunshots.</p><p>Myra was a San Francisco native, born to a Chinese-American father and a German-American mother. She’d attended a public elementary school, a public high school, and San Francisco State University, where she majored in theater arts and got average grades, not really excelling at anything, but never failing, either.</p><p>Some of the professors insisted on spelling it “theatre,” which always amused her.</p><p>Regardless, acting had always been a passion for Myra, and while she didn’t get the leading roles, she almost always got a part of some sort. When that didn’t happen, she helped out with the backstage crew. It made her feel as if she belonged.</p><p>Once she graduated she continued to live at home with her mother and father, who were always willing to let her do whatever she wanted as long as she didn’t get into trouble with the law.</p><p>That caveat was hardly necessary. Myra had never even been sent to detention in school, and her friends were hardly the types to do anything that might get them in trouble with anyone, much less the law. The only police she’d ever seen were the officers who happened to pass her by on the street.</p><p>At least until she took the job at Shin’s Delight.</p><p>While Myra enjoyed acting tremendously, and possessed genuine talent, she’d never felt the drive to pursue it as a career. She sent out her headshots and went on auditions, which garnered her parts in a bunch of different plays in the Tenderloin, but nothing that attracted any serious attention.</p><p>So, in the time-honored tradition of thespians throughout the centuries, she took a job as a waitress. As she accepted the position, she remembered a joke that had been told by one of her professors at SFSU.</p><p>A Man meets a woman at a bar.</p><p>Man asks, “What do you do?”</p><p>Woman says, “I’m an actress.”</p><p>Man replies, “Oh yeah? What restaurant?”</p><p>Myra’s features displayed only her father’s Chinese heritage, with the exception of the blue eyes she’d inherited from her mother. Her Asian appearance contributed to her difficulty in getting good roles, but they improved her chances of finding employment in the restaurants in Chinatown.</p><p>What was more, Myra spoke fluent Chinese and German, in addition to English, so she was eminently qualified to work in a restaurant that still—even in the tourist-heavy times—catered primarily to the locals.</p><p>Shin’s Delight on Pacific Avenue was just such a place. Even better, they were hiring.</p><p>At first, everything went well. Myra liked talking to people, she liked serving people, and she liked her coworkers. Truth be told, Myra got along with everyone.</p><p>With one possible exception—the strange, older man who ran the place.</p><p>Albert Chao was a secretive, pointy-nosed fellow who rarely came out of his office. When he did, it was usually to shout at someone in anger—whether justified or not. Or to talk to the police, who came by pretty regularly. Occasionally the visitor was a uniformed officer, but it was far more common to see a detective climbing the stairs.</p><p>Myra never understood why the police kept coming to the restaurant. She tried to ask Zhong, the manager, but he just brushed it off.</p><p>“It’s nothing that concerns us,” he said, glancing around the main dining room until his eyes lit on one of the tables. “Table four needs water—take care of it.” And he’d clapped his hands to send her on her way.</p><p>She’d done as he asked, but refused to be distracted.</p><p>Careful not to let Zhong know what she was doing, Myra asked around. But all she uncovered were rumors, and she didn’t like what they implied.</p><p>So she decided to let it drop.</p><p>A nearby small business had decided to celebrate the approaching Christmas holidays by bringing all forty of its employees to Shin’s Delight for lunch. That, in addition to the usual crowd, kept the entire staff hopping, and meant that their supplies ran out faster than expected. Soon they were running low on cloth napkins, so Zhong sent Myra upstairs to the supply closet to retrieve some that he had stashed there for just such an eventuality.</p><p>Her path took her past Albert Chao’s office, and she stepped quietly in order to remain unnoticed. As she did so, she heard what sounded like a car backfiring.</p><p>Except the sound came from immediately behind the closed door to the office. She wondered if it could have come in through one of the office windows, but then she smelled smoke.</p><p>Followed by laughter.</p><p>And then another shot.</p><p>Myra froze, clutching an armful of napkins to her chest. And somebody screamed.</p><p>The scream ended as abruptly as it had begun, only to be replaced by a whimpering sound. Concerned that someone might be hurt, she overcame her natural instinct—which cried out for her to run as fast as she could—and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Hello? Is everyone all right? I thought I heard something!”</p><p>The only response was the sound of another report— and then the whimpering stopped.</p><p>Once again Myra found that she couldn’t move, and to her the silence that followed was even more frightening than the noises had been.</p><p>Floorboards creaked, and the door opened slowly.</p><p>Albert Chao had a thick shock of white hair that stuck straight up on top and hung halfway down his back, making him look like an Asian mad scientist. He squinted at her with cruel eyes that sat menacingly over his pointed nose. That wasn’t the scary part, however. Pretty much every time she had seen him, he had looked like that.</p><p>No, what frightened her was the red stain on his chest. Myra had seen enough stage accidents to know exactly what a bloodstain looked like, and that was it.</p><p>“What do you want?” he asked in a frighteningly even tone.</p><p>Myra’s heart beat so fast she could feel it pounding against her ribs.</p><p>“I, uh—I was coming up to get more—more napkins, and uh—uh, I heard—“</p><p>“You heard nothing,” Mr. Chao said firmly. “You saw nothing. Do you understand?”</p><p>She nodded so rapidly that she feared her head might fly off her neck.</p><p>“Okay! Of course! I mean—“ she stammered. “Do you... do you need any help?”</p><p>“Go. Now.”</p><p>The next thing Myra knew, she was back downstairs with the napkins in hand, thrusting them into Zhong’s arms. She had no recollection of actually running down the staircase.</p><p>Yet there she was.</p><p>Zhong peered at her with concern.</p><p>“You all right?” he asked. “You look like you saw a ghost!”</p><p>“I, uh—“ But she couldn’t find the words, so she just stood there. Waiting for her to speak, Zhong finally ran out of patience.</p><p>“Well, get over it. We’ve still got to get through lunch.”</p><p>Sensitivity had never been his strong suit.</p><p>Despite Zhong’s business-as-usual attitude, a pall of tension hung over the restaurant. Myra hadn’t been the only person to hear gunshots, yet no one would speak of it. What’s more, people she knew disappeared—not the dining room staff, but people who worked in the offices upstairs, and she assumed they had quit due to the stress.</p><p>But Myra had no such option—she really needed this job.</p><p>Things grew worse over the subsequent two days, as more cops than usual came by. And they started talking to the staff. Finally she learned that bodies had been found in Ghirardelli Square, and the deceased had been tentatively identified as employees of Shin’s Delight. Tentatively, because they’d been very badly burned.</p><p>When it was her turn to be interviewed, Myra was tempted to tell the detectives about the incident with Mr. Chao. But if she did that, she might have to tell them about the rumors too. Rumors she hadn’t been willing to believe until the day they’d needed more napkins.</p><p>That Shin’s Delight was a front for the mob.</p><p>Myra didn’t know what mobsters looked like. Sure, she’d seen some odd-looking people going up and down the stairs, some of them entering by the front door, others through the back. But they were no stranger than the people employed by theatrical tech crews to do the heavy lifting. She never assumed they were gangsters, so why would she think that about the people in the restaurant?</p><p>So when the detective from the local precinct—a slightly heavyset man in an ill-fitting charcoal suit—asked her if she’d noticed anything unusual, Myra just told him that she didn’t know anything.</p><p>In many ways, it was the complete truth, she told herself. Nothing she had seen made sense, so how could she claim to “know” anything?</p><p>After she talked to the detective, the tension only got worse, and it began to involve her directly.</p><p>Each day it seemed as if Mr. Chao came downstairs just to glare at her. She overheard him asking Zhong about her work, and if she was talking unnecessarily with the other employees.</p><p>Zhong, bless him, sang her praises—or as close as he ever got to it.</p><p>“Haven’t caught her stealing anything yet,” he’d said flatly.</p><p>One December night after work she made plans to go to Golden Gate Park.</p><p>A burgeoning playwright acquaintance wanted to do a “table read” of the first act of his new piece, to make sure the dialogue sounded natural, and he’d asked a bunch of actors to help out. Like most up-and-coming writers, he couldn’t afford to rent a place to do it, and he didn’t live in a large enough apartment to hold them all, so he invited his volunteers to Marx Meadow “for a table read without a table,” as he put it.</p><p>Located on the edge of the park, Marx Meadow had plenty of picnic tables that were perfect for their use, and nearby streetlights kept the area safe and well populated, even after the early darkness of winter. Myra read the part of Gina, the heroine’s best friend—which was exactly the kind of role she always got. A lot of the dialogue was really clunky, she thought, but the playwright took a lot of notes.</p><p>When it was all done, most of the others announced that they were going out for drinks, and invited her along, but Myra had to be at work early the next morning.</p><p>Besides, she hated drinking.</p><p>So she said her goodnights and headed north. Since there were plenty of lights, she cut through the trees toward nearby Fulton Street, where she would catch the bus.</p><p>Suddenly there was a man on fire, blocking her path.</p><p>“Ohmigod,” she said. “Don’t move... wait, no! You have to drop and roll—yes, that’s it! That’ll put it out. Drop and roll!” She grabbed for her purse to pull out her cell phone and call 911.</p><p>But then she realized that he wasn’t screaming.</p><p>Or doing anything, really.</p><p>He just stood there.</p><p>“Can you hear me?” she asked, a shiver running up her spine. She glanced around quickly, but there was no one in the vicinity who might help. So she turned her attention back to the burning man.</p><p>Still he remained silent. That was when she saw that, even though they were surrounded by trees and bushes, nothing else had caught fire. Not even the grass.</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak again, but nothing came out. As she did so, the man raised his arms, which was when she noticed the big, curved sword.</p><p>It was also when the man finally spoke. His voice sounded like it was coming through a really lousy sound system—kind of murky and staticky. But whatever the guttural words meant, he wasn’t speaking English, Chinese, or German. It sounded to Myra like Japanese, and she thought she recognized the word “dragon” somewhere in there.</p><p>Doragon Kokoro. That was what he said.</p><p>But somehow, even though she didn’t understand the words, Myra knew.</p><p>Moving suddenly, he loomed over her.</p><p>She ran.</p><p>She didn’t pick a particular direction, she just started moving. Two years of waitressing had blessed her with strong legs, so she was able to move quickly through the trees.</p><p>But no matter where she turned, no matter how fast she moved, somehow Doragon Kokoro kept up with her, flames always burning upward, sword raised as if ready to slice her in two.</p><p>She lost track of where she was. Adding to her panic was the fact that the park—which even on a cool December night should have been at least a little crowded—was empty. Even when she found herself running across what she recognized as Kennedy Place, there was nobody.</p><p>She tried to scream for help, but all that came out was a rasping croak, and it only served to make her breath more ragged. Strong legs were one thing, but she hadn’t gone running for years. Her lungs were beginning to burn, and sharp pains were starting to shoot up through her calves.</p><p>Still she pressed on, hoping that she might lose her attacker.</p><p>Where is everyone?</p><p>Stumbling more than running, she came to the edge of Lloyd Lake, where she had to stop. And as she turned, she knew what she would see.</p><p>The burning man was there, sword held high, firelight reflecting in the dark water.</p><p>Finally she found her voice, but rather than a scream, it was a whimper.</p><p>“Oh God please no I don’t want to die. Please don’t kill me, please. I don’t want to die!”</p><p>Her voice rose, Doragon Kokoro hesitated, and Myra stopped, hoping beyond hope that she might have convinced him. She thought for just a moment that she saw sadness in his fire-covered eyes.</p><p>“I don’t want to die,” she repeated.</p><p>“Neither did I,” he replied as the sword slashed downward.</p><p>It was different, this time.</p><p>Now Nakadai could communicate with the living. His actions were still under the control of another, but he felt stronger, faster, more capable.</p><p>With these changes came a vexing question. He could still feel Albert Chao’s presence, but this time he could not be sure that it was Albert whose influence he followed.</p><p>He appeared in a forest lit by torches that burned without flame. Within an instant a woman stood before him, and one thing was clear—whoever she was, she had to die.</p><p>And so he pursued her until she had nowhere else to run.</p><p>“Oh God please no I don’t want to die. Please don’t kill me, please. I don’t want to die!” she said plaintively.</p><p>Nakadai hesitated, her words reminding him of what it was like to be human. Reminding him of what he had felt the day of his own death. How long ago had it been?</p><p>The sword slashed downward.</p><p>Moments later he stood over her charred, violated corpse by the still water of the lake, wondering how long he would be cursed to endure this.</p><p>“Well, well, well,” a voice said from behind him. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it, Nakadai?”</p><p>Turning, he saw a blond-haired young man wearing short pants and a sleeveless shirt.</p><p>“It sure is good to see you again,” the blond man said with a bright smile. “Of course, this isn’t quite going according to plan, but it’s a start.”</p><p>“I do not know of what you speak,” Nakadai said to the stranger. “But it is of no consequence. I will go now.”</p><p>“Not so fast, chuckles.” The man gestured.</p><p>Suddenly Nakadai found that he could not move.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes, he stared at the stranger. This was a Westerner—he was no descendant of Nakadai’s, so how could he control him, unless...?</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Yup.” Blue eyes and white irises were replaced by solid black. “I like this guy a lot more than Cho the messenger. He was one ugly cuss.”</p><p>“What do you want?” Though he could speak, the ronin still could not move.</p><p>The demon grinned, revealing perfect white teeth.</p><p>“What do you think I want?” he said, and this time there was a hint of the gutteral he had heard in Akemi’s voice. “You don’t think I had you burned alive just for kicks ‘n’ grins, do you?”</p><p>“I would not presume to understand how your mind functions.”</p><p>The demon laughed raucously.</p><p>“Fair enough,” he responded. “But no, I had me a long-term plan for you, Nakadai. Or should I say, ‘Heart of the Dragon’? I gotta admit, it tickles the hell outta me that you got stuck with that moniker for over 200 years. You did hate it so.”</p><p>“A plan?” Nakadai spat.</p><p>“Of course! And it’s finally time for that plan to bear fruit.”</p><p>“What is so special about now?”</p><p>The demon threw its head back and laughed again.</p><p>“Haven’t you been paying attention? I realize it’s not quite your bag, but the end of days has come! Y’know, ‘death comes on a pale horse’? Dogs and cats sleeping together.… Mass hysteria? It’s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine!”</p><p>Having no idea what the demon was babbling about, Nakadai simply stared.</p><p>Shaking his head, the demon sighed dramatically.</p><p>“You spirits of the damned, you have no appreciation of the classics. Look,” he held out his arms, as if to indicate the whole world, “what we’re talking about here is the Apocalypse. Demons and angels squaring off, and may the best seraph win. And you, Nakadai-san, are my ace in the hole.”</p><p>Nakadai frowned.</p><p>“I do not understand.”</p><p>“Surely you’ve noticed that you’ve got more mojo this time around. Before, you couldn’t do much more than swing your sword like a flaming fool. But things are different now.</p><p>“The seals are broken, Lucifer is free, God’s not in his Heaven, and all’s wrong with the world. So it’s time for you and me to go kick some angel ass.”</p><p>Another sigh.</p><p>“Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. That grand-niece of yours did a nice job of piggybacking onto my spell, and of creating that counter-spell. It’s too bad she was totally binky-bonkers—she could’ve had one helluva career as a witch.</p><p>“Be that as it may, what’s done is done, and her grandson’s got you all sucked into his groove.”</p><p>Nakadai shook his head in disgust.</p><p>“I knew I detected his hand in this,” he said. “So he has once again brought me back to commit evil in his name.”</p><p>“Nope—not this time. Thanks to that bastard John Winchester you were well and truly ensconced in the penalty box.”</p><p>Nakadai almost flinched at the venom with which the demon spoke. He wondered what the man—this John Winchester—had done to earn the demon’s hatred.</p><p>“But when the new moon came around,” the creature continued, “your little schmuck of a descendent didn’t even bother to call you back. Truth is, this is what you were built for—the Apocalypse. You’re our secret weapon.</p><p>“Yet Albert’s bound to call you sooner or later, and thanks to his loony tunes grandmother, as long as he’s got his hooks into you, the best I can do is make you do things on his behalf. But in order to keep you around, we need to keep him alive, too. If he bites the big one, then poof, you’re gone in a flash.</p><p>“This chick saw something she shouldn’t have.” He gestured at the corpse lying at Nakadai’s feet. “Can you believe that idiot was going to let her live? Moron. And he’s got bigger problems, too.”</p><p>The demon stared at Nakadai thoughtfully for a moment.</p><p>“Time’s running out. The angels are kicking our asses, and we need you. So just a warning, big guy—you’re gonna be playing for the home team soon enough.”</p><p>With that, the blond-haired head tilted backward, and black smoke came pouring out of his mouth. Once the smoke disappeared into the night sky, the man fell to the grass-and-dirt ground.</p><p>Dead.</p><p>Then Nakadai began to fade away, to remain in limbo until he was summoned again.</p><p>But by whom?</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>At age ten, Sam Winchester had become obsessed with maps.</p><p>It all started when he kept asking his father where they were going next. It was a reasonable question, since the answer was always different, and Sam was still young enough at the time to think it was exciting to know.</p><p>However, neither John nor the fourteen year-old Dean had much time for Sam’s curiosity. So to shut him up, his dad bought him an atlas.</p><p>This proved beneficial all around. John and Dean were no longer being pestered all the time, and Sam had found a hobby.</p><p>For weeks after he received the atlas, he would spend every minute of his spare time studying the maps it contained, learning how the highways and byways intertwined and intersected, the arrangements of smaller roads, the way some cities sought to lay out their streets in organized patterns. He studied the effects of topography, and the placements of borders and boundaries.</p><p>But the thing that most captured the fancy of his ten year-old brain was the U.S. Interstate Highway System—or, as he breathlessly told his father and brother after a trip to a public library in Indiana, “the Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways.” He lectured his indulgent dad and an impatient Dean all about the thirty-fourth President’s championing of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956, to create a system that would support commerce and serve as arteries should there be a nuclear war.</p><p>Sam especially loved the way the interstates were numbered. For the two-digit highways, odd numbers ran north to south, while the even numbers ran east to west. The higher the number, the farther north or east the road was located.</p><p>Dean refused to believe him. He claimed it was ridiculous, and that Sam had just made it up, but their father leapt to his younger son’s defense.</p><p>“A lot of those highways were being built when I was young,” John Winchester said, much to Sam’s delight. “Where there was a hill, they just cut right through it, and built the bridges over the rivers. Other times they followed the paths for existing roads.” He grinned at his sons. “‘Course, there wasn’t much need for that in Kansas—don’t have much in the way of hills there.”</p><p>Dean just hunched back in his seat and scowled, calling them a couple of dexters.</p><p>Like most childhood obsessions, this one burned itself out fairly quickly. But Sam still retained the facility for maps that it had engendered, and it wasn’t long before he was doing all the navigating for the Winchester family hunts.</p><p>To a great degree Mapquest and Google Maps had subverted the need for the atlas. Even so, Sam didn’t entirely trust them. Too often they sent the brothers the wrong way down a one-way street or across a bridge that no longer existed—if it ever had. So for every trip Sam pulled out a traditional map and used it as a backup.</p><p>Invariably he was able to find a more efficient route than the one suggested by the computer.</p><p>Dean and Sam both knew all the best ways to get from the Singer Salvage Yard in South Dakota to pretty much every major highway. Interstate 80, the one on which they were currently motoring, stretched across the country from New York to San Francisco, and was probably the highway on which the Impala spent the most time. It was a straight shot west from Omaha, Nebraska to the Bay Bridge.</p><p>As soon as they finished scouring Bobby’s library, looking for everything he had about Doragon Kokoro, Sam and Dean had hit the road. It was midday, and Sam took the first leg while Dean—who’d been up all night playing poker—slept in the passenger seat. Then, by the time evening rolled around, Dean took over.</p><p>That meant two things.</p><p>First, the music from the tape deck got louder, beginning with Metallica’s ...And Justice for All.</p><p>Second, it meant Sam had the opportunity to reread the journal. Bobby’s books and papers hadn’t turned up a lot, nor had the internet, but it was a start, and now he wanted to review what John had written.</p><p>Their father’s perspective, viewed in light of Bobby’s material, added some interesting wrinkles.</p><p>“Huh,” he muttered.</p><p>Dean reached to turn down the music just as ‘The Shortest Straw’ was starting.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Sam blinked. He hadn’t meant to speak out loud.</p><p>“I was just rereading Dad’s notes,” he explained. “He had an interesting take on Albert Chao, the guy who summoned the spirit the last two times. Dad saw him as the typical summoner type. Y’know, a weaselly little guy who isn’t able to make it in the world—or at least not in the world the way he thinks it ought to be. So he goes all occult, to make up for his own shortcomings.”</p><p>“He should try a blue pill, instead,” Dean said sarcastically. “Anyhow, it shouldn’t matter. From what little I read, Dad didn’t think Chao had a snowball’s chance in hell of staying alive after the spirit got banished.”</p><p>Sam shook his head.</p><p>“I don’t know, Dean. Everything I read at Bobby’s says that this Chao guy has to be the one to summon it. He’s the one with the ronin as his ancestor, and according to the texts, the spirit remains tethered to whoever summons it, and renders that person impervious to harm.”</p><p>“So, what, we can’t shoot this guy?”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>“Well, we can, but it won’t do any good. Best bet is to do what Dad did—cast the spell on the sword. Unfortunately, that’ll just banish the warrior for another twenty years.”</p><p>Dean’s expression turned grim.</p><p>“You’re assuming the world’s still gonna be around in twenty years. Hell, I ain’t puttin’ any money on makin’ it another twenty days.”</p><p>That elicited a sigh from Sam.</p><p>“Yeah, you’ve got a point. But Cass seems to think this Heart of the Dragon is important, so we’ve got to do what we can.”</p><p>Neither brother had much to say after that, so Dean turned Metallica back up. The tape had moved on to ‘Harvester of Sorrow,’ and Sam went back to trying to decipher his father’s chicken-scratch handwriting.</p><p>Eventually, he drifted off to sleep himself. By the time he woke up, the sun was coming up in the east and the Impala was zipping out of Sacramento.</p><p>“So, we got a plan?” Dean asked without a preamble.</p><p>Sam rubbed the sleep out of his eyes.</p><p>“Coffee?”</p><p>Dean chuckled.</p><p>“Next rest stop we see.”</p><p>Flipping their dad’s leather-bound notebook open to the right page, Sam looked for a name.</p><p>“We might as well head for the motel Dad stayed in—the Emperor Norton Lodge. It’s on Ellis Street, not all that far from Chinatown. Then, I guess we try the restaurant where Dad banished the spirit last time.”</p><p>Dean shot him a look.</p><p>“Emperor Norton?”</p><p>Sam paused before he replied.</p><p>“You don’t know about Emperor Norton?”</p><p>“Not unless you’re talking about Art Carney’s character on The Honeymooners,” Dean replied. “And I don’t think he even made it to Grand High Exalted Mystic Ruler of the Raccoons.”</p><p>Sam laughed.</p><p>“I can’t believe you never heard the story. Joshua Norton was a failed businessman who completely lost it. In 1859, he declared himself ‘Norton I, Emperor of these United States and Protector of Mexico.’ He dissolved Congress, created his own currency—Oh, and he also levied a fine of twenty-five dollars on anyone who called the city ‘’Frisco.’”</p><p>Dean snorted.</p><p>“Yeah, well, if we run across him, I’ll give him a twenty and a five.”</p><p>“Nobody took him seriously, but everybody loved him. And he had some good ideas. One of his decrees was that they should build the Bay Bridge and construct the BART. In fact, I think I remember reading a few years back that they tried to get the bridge renamed after him.”</p><p>“Fine, so we’ll stay in the royal suite and get some Chinese food. Meanwhile, there’s a diner at the next exit.”</p><p>Sam looked up and saw a blue sign that indicated what eateries were available at the upcoming exit. Besides the diner, there were three fast-food joints and a Starbucks. He was tempted to suggest the Starbucks—thanks to Dean’s poker winnings, they could actually afford it—but decided not to open that particular can of worms. They’d been back hunting together for a while now, and things were going well.</p><p>But the wounds were still relatively fresh. It wasn’t so much that Sam had started the Apocalypse.</p><p>No, Sam thought to himself, that sucks, but what really hurt Dean was that I trusted Ruby more than I did him. I lied to him, and I betrayed him.</p><p>He should have known better.</p><p>If there’s one thing we’ve got to remember, it’s that we’re better together than we are apart.</p><p>So he decided he didn’t need to go to Starbucks.</p><p>He just nodded as Dean moved into the right lane.</p><p>Albert was in a good mood when he woke up that morning.</p><p>Preferring a commute that only required him to go down a flight of stairs, he maintained an apartment over Shin’s Delight. As he came out of the bathroom, his cell phone rang.</p><p>At first Albert had loved the invention of the cell phone. With cell phones, he could talk to any of his people without delay, and that had been very convenient as he had solidified his power over Tommy Shin’s branch of the Triads. Just as Tommy had been far ahead of the Old Man in the exploitation of technology, Albert had become even cannier in its use.</p><p>Unfortunately, so had law enforcement. Just as he had used the phones to maintain a constant awareness of their activities, it had become ridiculously easy for the police to track down his people, as well.</p><p>The disposable cell phone had alleviated the problem to a great degree—easily purchased at any convenience store, and impossible for the cops to tap into.</p><p>So Albert changed his cell phone once a month, like clockwork. The accounts were all in the names of the children who ran errands for the Triads—the most low-level personnel in his organization, who knew absolutely nothing and couldn’t be tried as adults, in any case.</p><p>The cell phone that was ringing now was registered to the son of the drycleaner two doors down. In return for the use of the boy’s name, the father received a slight discount on his monthly payments. Albert reached over, saw that he had a message from Oscar Randolph, and the display indicated that it was Han calling. So he flipped it open.</p><p>“It’s that waitress Myra Wu,” Han said. “They found her body in Golden Gate Park. It was just like Roy and Jack.”</p><p>Muttering a curse in Japanese, Albert snapped the phone shut.</p><p>How can this be possible?</p><p>Albert hadn’t wanted Myra killed any more than he’d wanted Roy or Jack killed. Sure, she had been a minor annoyance, but he’d checked and confirmed that she hadn’t said anything to the police. Indeed, he appreciated employees who kept their mouths shut without needing to be threatened. As for Roy and Jack, they were idiots, and they’d fouled up the gun deal with that motorcycle gang, but Albert hadn’t been all that sanguine about dealing with the thugs anyhow.</p><p>None of them had done anything that warranted having them killed.</p><p>But that wasn’t the worst of it.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon is back, he mused, his mind reeling. But it can’t be. There’s no one else.…</p><p>It had been twenty years since a gaijin named John Winchester had cast a spell to banish the spirit for another eighty seasons. That had forced Albert to fend for himself, and he’d found ways to do so. With Tommy Shin’s subsequent death, Albert hadn’t needed occult assistance. He had everything he wanted.</p><p>He’d come to realize that Doragon Kokoro wasn’t a pistol to pull out any time he felt like it. Such a weapon needed to be held in reserve. And no such time had arisen.</p><p>Still cursing under his breath, he got dressed and headed downstairs.</p><p>Zhong was waiting for him outside his office door.</p><p>“Is it true about Myra?” he demanded.</p><p>“Yes,” Albert replied. He reached into his pants pocket and fished out the key to his office.</p><p>“Dammit,” Zhong said. “Now I have to hire another waitress.”</p><p>Under other circumstances, Albert might have smiled. Zhong was never sentimental—it made him a good manager.</p><p>He opened the door, and Zhong followed him inside.</p><p>“People have been talking,” he said hesitantly.</p><p>Albert looked up at him, he was surprised as Zhong was never hesitant.</p><p>“Talking about what?”</p><p>“The Heart of the Dragon,” his manager replied. “Look, I wasn’t here back then, and I don’t give a damn what happened to Lin. If you wanted to spread word around that you controlled some sort of demon, that was your business—Hell, it worked. No one questions your authority. But the chatter is springing up again, and it’s getting out of hand. Ever since they found Roy and Jack’s bodies in Ghirardelli Square.”</p><p>Sitting down at his desk, Albert turned his computer on. While it booted up, he turned to face Zhong.</p><p>“What if they were true?”</p><p>“Beg your pardon?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Albert said, and he turned back to his computer. On second thought, it didn’t make sense to take Zhong into his confidence. Besides, he would probably just think his boss had gone insane. The Heart of the Dragon was just a story, and Albert was perfectly content to keep it that way.</p><p>But then, who killed Roy, Jack, and Myra? And why do it in a way that pointed to the spirit?</p><p>“You can rest assured, Zhong, that I have not summoned any spirits lately to kill people who annoy me.”</p><p>“And why not?” came the response.</p><p>Albert blinked.</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“If the spirit’s free,” Zhong continued, “why not put it to good use?”</p><p>Albert blinked again.</p><p>“What’re you talking about?”</p><p>Zhong grinned. That was even more out of character.</p><p>“I’m talking about Doragon Kokoro, Albert. I’m talking about the spirit you raised forty years ago, and could’ve raised again, but haven’t. The question is, why?”</p><p>As he spoke, Zhong’s eyes flicked to a deep black that seemed to penetrate deep into his skull.</p><p>Albert rose to his feet.</p><p>“What do you want, demon?”</p><p>Zhong’s features expressed surprise.</p><p>“You actually know what I am?”</p><p>“Ever since I had the Heart of the Dragon ripped from my grasp a second time, I’ve made a point of learning more about the occult,” Albert said, fingering a charm he wore around his neck. He even had a consultant on the payroll— an old gaijin named Oscar Randolph—though he hadn’t made much use of the man for a while now.</p><p>“I know what you are, demon. What I do not know is why you are here.”</p><p>The creature wearing Zhong’s face used it to sneer.</p><p>“Because you have something that belongs to me,” he said, all trace of amusement gone. “Doragon Kokoro is mine, Albert Chao. I created him. And I still have control over him but, right now, only if what he does corresponds to your wishes.”</p><p>“Yet I had no wish to kill those people!” Albert snapped.</p><p>“Sure you did,” the demon said in Zhong’s voice. “Maybe not consciously, but in the back of your mind—in that place where you keep the little boy who was always rejected, who never got what he wanted. He wanted those three dead.</p><p>“As for what I want, it’s simple: I want my spirit back. Playing puppet-master is good for a few laughs, but I have some angels that need killing.</p><p>“So you’re going to hand him over.”</p><p>Albert smiled. With that declaration, the demon had revealed that Albert had power over him.</p><p>He continued to finger the charm, which he’d purchased several years ago from Bela Talbot, a friend of Oscar’s. Bela had promised that it was a powerful talisman that protected him from possession, and it obviously worked. If the demon had wanted control of the Heart of the Dragon, all it had to do was possess Albert.</p><p>Unless it couldn’t.</p><p>“Then you have a problem, demon, because I will not relinquish control of my ancestor’s spirit. Not to anyone or anything. You’ll have to kill me—but, oh yes, you can’t, can you?” That last was added with a wide smile. “Not unless you want Doragon Kokoro to disappear back into oblivion.”</p><p>“No—and I can’t possess you as long as you have that... thing around your neck.” Yet strangely, it was the demon’s turn to smile. “But don’t imagine that I can’t hurt you, Albert Chao. I’ve already proven that.”</p><p>“By killing three of my people?” Albert dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand. “Pfah. Their lives mattered little to me. Many have tried to hurt me over the years, demon, but I am still here.”</p><p>“Many humans have tried to hurt you, but that’s not really a yardstick I’m gonna take too terribly seriously.”</p><p>The demon sighed. “Look, maybe we can work out a deal.”</p><p>He leaned over the desk, and his pitch black eyes caused Albert to shudder involuntarily.</p><p>“I just need to borrow Nakadai for a while. I can make it worth your while.”</p><p>Albert laughed.</p><p>“What will you grant me, demon? A lesson to those who ostracized me? Petty revenge against slights, both real and imagined? Had you made such an offer when first I summoned my ancestor, I gladly would have accepted. In my callow youth, that was precisely what I used the Heart of the Dragon for. I was a pathetic child, treating all injustices as if they were of great consequence.”</p><p>Albert leaned forward, putting his palms flat on his desk.</p><p>“I am no longer that child. It was the lack of the spirit that truly granted me my heart’s desire. I came to the attention of the Triads through my own hard work, using my skills to overcome my half-breed status. I have stayed in power for twenty years without the spirit. Having the Heart of the Dragon taken away was the best thing that ever happened to me.”</p><p>Zhong snorted like an animal.</p><p>“Skills. Right. That would be the invulnerability granted to you by Doragon Kokoro, yes? Without it, you’d be worm food.”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Albert responded, determined to remain resolute. “But the spirit is mine, to do with it as I wish.”</p><p>The demon walked up to the desk and leaned into Albert’s face. On its breath, Albert could smell the peanut sauce that Zhong slathered on all of his food.</p><p>“Then give it to me,” it hissed.</p><p>Albert stood up straight.</p><p>“I will consider your offer, demon. Come back tomorrow for an answer.”</p><p>The black eyes stared at him for several seconds without blinking.</p><p>Then Zhong’s head leaned back and a stream of black smoke issued forth from his gaping mouth, funneling upward toward the ceiling like an obsidian tornado.</p><p>Then it was gone, and Zhong collapsed to the ground unconscious.</p><p>Albert called downstairs for someone to take care of Zhong, then he pulled his cell phone out of his pocket.</p><p>He hadn’t returned Oscar’s message, hadn’t even listened to it, because he thought he was done with the occult. Throughout the ‘90s, he’d been obsessed with learning everything he could, but in recent years he’d had little use for it. He’d even been considering taking Oscar off the payroll. Now, though, it seemed the occult would be useful to him once again.</p><p>Opening the phone, he listened to the message.</p><p>“Hey yo, Albert, it’s Oscar. Listen, I know you ain’t been givin’ much of a crap about what I gotta tell you, but remember that tracking spell you asked me to cast a while back, looking for that hook sword? Well, you ain’t gonna believe this, but the spell just reactivated. Nearly set my damn house on fire, too.</p><p>“Look, call me back, okay?”</p><p>Albert cursed himself for a fool.</p><p>Forty years ago, a bald man and his wife and daughter had thwarted him, and wrenched from him the greatest weapon he had ever possessed. But what he hadn’t possessed were the resources to find out where they came from.</p><p>Twenty years ago, it had happened again—and again, at the hands of a white man. This time he had been able to turn up a name: John Winchester.</p><p>But nothing more.</p><p>In 1996, Albert found Oscar Randolph, who had a house in Mill Valley that he’d inherited from his father, a doctor who died in the Korean War.</p><p>When Albert went to the old house in the San Francisco suburb for the first time, a weathered Caucasian with a thick white beard and very little white hair answered the door. He had on a faded flannel shirt, worn-out jeans, and unpolished cowboy boots.</p><p>“What the hell do you want?”</p><p>“My name is Albert Chao, and I wish to hire you.”</p><p>The man laughed heartily.</p><p>“You wanna hire me? That suit your wearin’s worth more’n my house, and that tattoo you got means you’re Triad. The hell you need me for?”</p><p>“The Triads’ connections do not extend to the spirit world,” Albert pressed. “Yours do. That information is of value to me.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Oscar scratched the chin under his thick beard. “So you don’t want me to kill nothin’?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“That’s too bad.”</p><p>Albert frowned.</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>Oscar grinned again.</p><p>“‘Cause I was hopin’ I’d get to kill something. Hell, that’s the only thing I miss from huntin’.” The grin fell. “So whaddaya want?”</p><p>“Information.”</p><p>“Any good reason I should take the offer?”</p><p>With a small smile, Albert replied.</p><p>“Because you do not wish to starve to death. Your father’s inheritance has run out. Your investments have failed. Within six months, you will join the ranks of the homeless and be destitute. I can save you from that.”</p><p>For several seconds, Oscar stared at Albert. Finally he spoke.</p><p>“This information you need—would it involve rattin’ out other hunters?”</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>Oscar broke into another grin.</p><p>“Works for me. Buncha morons, all of ‘em. Bustin’ their asses to stop evil, and evil keeps getting’ stronger. Waste’a time. Sick’a the whole lot of ‘em, and I’m more than happy to stick it to ‘em.”</p><p>He thrust out a hand.</p><p>“You got yourself an employee, Mr. Chao.”</p><p>Oscar called himself a “hunter,” and from what he said, that’s exactly what John Winchester had been, as well.</p><p>That Oscar had reached retirement impressed Albert. The information he’d collected in seven years was sketchy, but one thing he’d learned was that most of those who chose to hunt the supernatural didn’t live long enough to retire.</p><p>Over the years, Oscar had provided more and more information, even as Albert became less and less interested in hearing it. It wasn’t all reliable, and much of it was contradictory, but it still provided some insight into the world that had intersected with his every time he summoned the Heart of the Dragon.</p><p>Just a year ago Oscar had confirmed as best he could that John Winchester was dead. The stories ranged from word that he had been killed by vampires to possession by a demon, being shot with an antique gun, and eaten by ghouls. One story had him dying the mundane death of being run over by a truck.</p><p>However, Winchester apparently had two sons who had become impressive hunters in their own right. Albert didn’t believe all the stories Oscar shared—they were ridiculous even by the standards of the supernatural.</p><p>Profits were up. If the Apocalypse was coming, then clearly it was good for business.</p><p>At that point, however, Oscar had mentioned that he could cast a spell that would alert him if the hook sword ever came back within the San Francisco city limits. Since the date was approaching when Albert would once again be able to summon Nakadai, he had told the old hunter to cast it.</p><p>Then he forgot all about it—until today.</p><p>He returned Oscar’s call.</p><p>“Yo?”</p><p>“Where’s the sword, Oscar?”</p><p>“Good to hear from you, Oscar. How you been, Oscar? Sure has been a long time since we talked, Oscar,” the old man said sarcastically.</p><p>Albert had no patience for it.</p><p>“I was just visited by a demon who is exerting control over the Heart of the Dragon. If the hook sword is in San Francisco, I need it. Where is it?”</p><p>“Somewhere on Ellis Street,” the hunter replied, all traces of sarcasm gone from his voice. “Just got in this morning, and I went right down there to locate the exact spot. I couldn’t pin it down ‘zactly, but I got close—I’m sure of it. Emailed you a map with the address.”</p><p>Albert quickly checked his email, then forwarded the missive on to Tiny’s account.</p><p>“Thank you, Oscar,” he said. “And keep your phone handy. I may have need of your services again soon.”</p><p>“No problem. Want me to whip up a Devil’s Trap for you? Might come in handy if you need to go toe-to-toe with a demon.”</p><p>“That would be excellent,” Albert replied. “Bring it by the restaurant today.”</p><p>“You got it.”</p><p>Then Albert cut off Oscar and called Tiny.</p><p>“I just sent you a map which pinpoints a block. On that block is a hotel, I want you to locate two young men who have checked into that hotel—they’re brothers, so they may have the same last name. They have in their possession a hook sword that has kanji characters on it. I want that sword.</p><p>“Take Jake with you. Don’t feel bad about killing anyone who tries to stop you.”</p><p>“Yeah, Boss.”</p><p>One of the reasons Albert liked Tiny was that his vocabulary consisted almost exclusively of the two words, “Yeah, Boss.” At least, that was all he said when he was talking with Albert, which was what mattered.</p><p>Even though he had no use of the spirit—at least not now—the Heart of the Dragon belonged to Albert.</p><p>He would not let some smart-ass demon take it from him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam nodded as he stared at the room they’d been given at the hotel. It was actually better than a lot of the dumps they typically stayed in, but that wasn’t saying a great deal. The wallpaper didn’t look as if it’d been changed since their father stayed there. The phone was still a rotary. And when he sat on the bed closest to the door, Sam could feel the springs jabbing his butt.</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam said in answer to Dean’s query, “crazy as a loon.”</p><p>“Well, he had a lousy interior decorator, too,” Dean said as he dumped his duffel bag at the foot of the other bed, then lay down on it. “I’m guessin’ our Chinese restaurant doesn’t open till lunch—that right?” he said to the ceiling.</p><p>“I’ll find out.”</p><p>Sam pulled his laptop out of the bag and went to sit at the tiny desk. He flipped it open and dug around underneath to find an outlet. There were only two, and between the lamp and the television, both were occupied. So he unplugged the lamp.</p><p>He knew better than to mess with the television.</p><p>Sure enough, Dean grabbed the remote off the nightstand, and clicked impatiently through the hotel’s offerings.</p><p>It took more than a minute for Sam’s laptop to boot up. He sighed, knowing it was only a matter of time before they would need a new one—this one was a few years old and had so much stuff loaded onto it that it was a miracle it still worked at all.</p><p>Unfortunately, their only sources of income were poker winnings, pool hustling, and charity from Bobby. But Bobby wasn’t being charitable since he’d been crippled. Besides, it was one thing to gas up the Impala or keep them fed. He wasn’t likely to pony up a thousand bucks—or more—for a decent laptop.</p><p>Once the computer finally finished booting, the wireless card found an unsecure network belonging to the hotel. One advantage to staying in cheap motels was that most of them had their own free wireless networks these days. The fancy hotels charged obscene rates for online access.</p><p>First thing, Sam checked the restaurant’s hours, and confirmed that it opened at noon. Then he downloaded his email, and also did a web search prompted by something he’d read in his father’s journal.</p><p>Bingo.</p><p>“Hey, Dean,” he said, “I’ve got something that might be useful. Remember Dad mentioning that professor up at Berkeley?”</p><p>“Yeah, I think so,” Dean replied. “Why?”</p><p>“Well, he’s still there. He’s the Assistant Chair of the Asian Studies Department now. Might be a good idea to go talk with him.”</p><p>Clambering off his bed, Dean shrugged.</p><p>“Might help,” he said. “Then again, if we’re lucky, we’ll just show up at the restaurant, cast the right spell, grab some chicken chow fun, and leave.”</p><p>Sam just stared at him.</p><p>“Dude—have we ever been that lucky?”</p><p>Dean reached into his duffel and pulled out the hook sword.</p><p>“Guess not.” He set the sword aside and settled back onto the bed. “Guess you better call the dude.”</p><p>So while Dean immersed himself in the previous week’s episode of Dr. Sexy M.D., Sam called U.C. Berkeley, navigated through an irritating stream of automated messages—made even more so by the rotary phone—and finally got Marcus Wallace’s voicemail.</p><p>“Hi Professor, this is Sam Winchester—I’m calling on behalf of myself and my brother Dean. Twenty years ago you met our father, John Winchester, and I think you know Bobby Singer, too.</p><p>“We’re in San Francisco because the Heart of the Dragon’s back, and we need your help. If you could call me back, please, that would be great.”</p><p>Sam provided his cell phone number, then ended the call.</p><p>After that, he called Bobby to check in.</p><p>“The angel stopped by, and said he’d be comin’ at some point,” Bobby said, bitterness in his voice. Given his condition, he seriously resented the fact that Castiel no longer had the ability to heal. For his part, Cass didn’t seem to care all that much—which pissed off Bobby even more. “I’ll let the bastard know you got there, and where y’are, in case you need some heavenly hosting.”</p><p>“Okay, Bobby, thanks.” He wasn’t sure Castiel needed to be told, but saying so would just be like rubbing salt into the crippled man’s wounds. So he just hung up.</p><p>Then he did some more web digging, trying to see if there had been anything reported in the past couple of days. Sure enough, that morning’s San Francisco Chronicle had a story about two as-yet-unidentified bodies—a man and a woman—found near Lloyd Lake in Golden Gate Park. The woman had been burned to a crisp, with lengthy cuts over a large portion of her body. Strangely, the man was found with no obvious trauma.</p><p>“We’ve got another burned victim,” Sam said. “And the wounds are consistent with—“</p><p>Sam cut himself off when he heard a familiar snore. Turning around, he saw that Dean had dozed off. Looking over his shoulder at the screen, he saw Dr. Sexy was being slapped by one of the nurses, and winced in sympathy.</p><p>He walked over to the bed and gently pulled the remote out of Dean’s sleep-loosened grip, hitting the power button so he could use the computer in peace.</p><p>That caused Dean to jump.</p><p>“Hey, I was watchin’ that!” he bellowed.</p><p>“Sorry,” Sam said quietly, turning the set back on, then handing back the remote. Dean had to surf through to find the show again.</p><p>Before he could get there, however, someone kicked in the door.</p><p>“So then the one girl just grabs the other girl and starts yankin’ on her hair. Now my first thought is, ‘Hey, it’s a party,’ but of course I know they ain’t gonna keep it under control, so I figure I gotta intervene.”</p><p>James “Tiny” Deng grunted as he turned one of Albert Chao’s SUVs onto Ellis Street and looked for a place to park. He really hated being paired up with Jake Leung, because Jake just never shut up.</p><p>“So I go to try to pull ‘em apart, and one of them—the one with the long hair—she goes and claws at my arm! Look at what she did to me!” Jake held up an arm to show the scratches, but Tiny didn’t really pay any attention.</p><p>There was no parking to be found on Ellis, but Tiny finally found a spot in front of a hydrant, shrugged, and parked there. He pulled a piece of paper out of the glove compartment and put it on the dashboard. It said SFPD – OFFICIAL in big block letters. Tiny had no idea where the boss got them, but they proved handy when you couldn’t find parking.</p><p>Only once in Tiny’s recollection did someone get towed, and the boss got the car back without paying a single penny. Now that was how to run a business.</p><p>“Anyhow, I had to teach the bitch a lesson, so’s I—“</p><p>By this time, Tiny had already liberated his six-foot-eight-inch frame from the SUV, and was just staring at his partner, still belted into the passenger seat.</p><p>“Uh, Jake? We’re here.”</p><p>“Huh?” Jake looked around, suddenly aware of the fact that the car had stopped. “Right.” He opened the door and jumped out onto the sidewalk, just missing the hydrant. “So what’re we looking for again?”</p><p>Again, Tiny grunted. He had already gone over it, but Jake was so fond of the sound of his own voice that he hadn’t paid any attention.</p><p>“We need to find a couple’a guys in a hotel,” he said. “They’ve got a sword of some kind, and we’re s’posed to get it for the boss. He said to kill anyone who gets in the way.”</p><p>“Okay. Let’s do it. Hope they don’t got no bitches with ‘em, though. I don’t want anymore scratches.” He glanced ruefully at his arm, which as far as Tiny could see didn’t have a mark on it.</p><p>Tiny looked around. He spotted a three-story façade with a framing shop on the ground floor, and a sign next to the door that led upstairs.</p><p>“That looks like the place—let’s check it out.”</p><p>Tiny headed for the door, Jake following. Climbing the narrow stairs, they wound up in a lobby with cracked-leather sofas and peeling wallpaper. Beyond were two hallways with frayed carpeting. Sitting behind the battered old wooden desk was an acne-covered young man reading a copy of Entertainment Weekly. The nametag on his chest read ELMER.</p><p>Without even looking up from the magazine, Elmer spoke in a bored voice.</p><p>“Can I help you?”</p><p>Exchanging a quick glance with Jake, Tiny pulled out his .45. Jake did likewise. Tiny had a Kimber Ultra Refined Carry Pistol II, while Jake had, as usual, overdone it with a Para-Ordnance Nite-Tac ACP. Most of the time, the guns were just for show, anyhow. When staring down the barrel of a hand-cannon like these, people generally did exactly what they were told.</p><p>When he didn’t get an answer, Elmer dropped his magazine and jumped out of his seat, knocking it over backward.</p><p>“Oh God, don’t kill me please don’t—“</p><p>“Shut up!” Jake yelled. “You sound like a bitch. I hate bitches.”</p><p>“Just one question,” Tiny said, ignoring his partner. “Did anyone check in this morning? Maybe a couple’a guys, mid-twenties?”</p><p>Elmer was unable to take his eyes off the barrel of Tiny’s Kimber.</p><p>“There was—was—was—these, uh, these two guys. In, uh, in Room 102.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Tiny said. He nodded toward the stairs. “Now get out of here and don’t come back for an hour. If you say a word to anyone, we’ll find you, and shoot you in the face.”</p><p>Elmer took the stairs two at a time and burst out of the front door.</p><p>Tiny turned and led Jake down one of the hallways, following the sign that indicated rooms 100–150. With his height and broad shoulders, he filled the narrow passageway.</p><p>Once they were standing in front of Room 102, Tiny held up three large fingers.</p><p>Then two.</p><p>Then one.</p><p>And he kicked in the door.</p><p>Sure enough, there were two little white men in the room. Of course, from his perspective, everyone was little.…</p><p>One had shaggy brown hair, and he sat at the desk. The other was perched on the edge of one of the beds, the one closer to the window. He was holding a sword—almost certainly the one the boss had sent them to fetch.</p><p>He held up his .45.</p><p>“Don’t move.”</p><p>“We’re not moving,” the one at the desk said quickly, standing and putting his hands up.</p><p>“Nobody’s gotta get hurt, all right?” Jake said. “We’re just here to take that little pig-sticker away from you. Might put an eye out, y’know?”</p><p>The guy sitting on the bed had short hair. He regarded Jake warily.</p><p>“You want this sword?”</p><p>“That’s right. So shut your ugly face and hand it over!”</p><p>Jake crossed the distance between them.</p><p>Tiny kept his own weapon aimed at the one who was standing.</p><p>Stepping up next to the guy with the sword, Jake pressed his .45 right against the side of his head, then held out his free hand.</p><p>“Give it here.” He tried to sound menacing. “Don’t try nothin’ stupid, or I’ll shoot you, swear to God.”</p><p>Tiny knew better, and wished his partner would just stop talking. At that range, if Jake actually fired the weapon the recoil would knock him to the floor, plus the shot would go wild. The only time Jake had ever fired his weapon was at a gun range in the Presidio, where the target was standing still.</p><p>Suddenly the guy smacked Jake’s hand aside, grabbing the barrel and clubbing Jake in the face with the hilt of the sword.</p><p>For a second, Tiny didn’t react. He’d been an enforcer for years now, and he’d never seen anyone do anything other than wet themselves at the sight of a .45.</p><p>He was pretty sure that if Jake had stopped talking for half a second, this would never have happened.</p><p>The one by the desk leapt at him, and Tiny tried to squeeze a shot off, but it fired harmlessly into the ceiling. Cheap plaster came raining down on them both as the guy tackled him.</p><p>Or, at least, tried to. Tiny weighed almost 300 pounds, and most of it was muscle.</p><p>The guy punched Tiny several times in the chest.</p><p>Tiny just smiled.</p><p>Then he punched the guy full-force in the face, sending him flying across the hotel room, where he collided with the desk chair and collapsed in a heap. He lay there, out cold.</p><p>Turning, Tiny saw that the other brother had gotten hold of the .45 and was now pointing it at Jake—though from a safe enough distance that Jake couldn’t do anything but sweat profusely. Jake sat down on the bed closest to the door.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>Short-hair set the sword on the bed and held the .45 with both hands.</p><p>Pointing his own .45 at the guy, Tiny adopted his most menacing voice.</p><p>“Drop it.”</p><p>“You first, Charlie Chan. Make one move, and I ventilate your boy here.”</p><p>Tiny shrugged.</p><p>“Go ahead. It’ll finally shut him up.”</p><p>“Hey!” Jake said. “What the hell, Tiny, why can’t you—?”</p><p>Aiming downward, Tiny shot Jake four times in the chest. It’d be easy to convince the boss that these guys had done it. What’s he gonna do? Check for ballistics?</p><p>But he heard five reports, and stumbled backward. A sharp pain lanced down through his arm, from his shoulder.</p><p>Even as Tiny killed Jake, the guy had shot him.</p><p>That really pissed Tiny off.</p><p>Getting his feet under him, he swung the Kimber upward. But before he could fire, something hit him in the head.</p><p>Putting a hand to his forehead, he felt blood trickling down into his eyes. His vision blurred, but he saw the longhaired brother scrambling to his feet. Tiny wasn’t sure what he’d thrown, but it hurt.</p><p>The guy crossed the room in a leap, grabbed Tiny’s arm, and chopped down hard. It didn’t hurt all that much, but Tiny reflexively dropped his .45.</p><p>Using his free arm, Tiny punched him in the face again. It was the arm that had taken the bullet, and it hurt like a bitch.</p><p>As the guy fell backward again, Tiny fell forward next to the bed closest to the door. Though he was still conscious, he didn’t move.</p><p>“Stand up and do not go for the gun,” said the one with Jake’s .45.</p><p>But Tiny wasn’t even sure where his gun had fallen to. In any case, he had a better idea.</p><p>Inserting his fingers into the gap between the mattress and the box spring, he hoisted the mattress up, tossing it right toward the guy with the gun. As he did so, he lumbered to his feet.</p><p>The report of Jake’s .45 echoed throughout the room, the bullet punching a hole in the mattress.</p><p>“Dean!” the other guy cried.</p><p>Tiny stepped over Jake’s corpse and grabbed the hook sword off the other bed. The taller one also lunged for it, but Tiny hit him with the hilt the same way Dean had hit Jake.</p><p>At first, Tiny was going to finish these two off—then he decided against it. There hadn’t been a direct order, just an instruction not to hesitate to kill if he had to. At this point, though, he had blood trickling into his eyes, he couldn’t really move his left arm—it hurt like a sonofabitch—and he had what he came for.</p><p>Best to cut his losses.</p><p>He didn’t feel great about leaving behind the .45s—it was standard operating procedure to get rid of any guns that had been used in a felony. Somehow, though, he didn’t think these two were likely to go to the cops.</p><p>So while they struggled with the mattress, he ducked out of the hotel room.</p><p>At first Dean had no idea who the two guys were who burst into the room, but once they demanded the hook sword, he figured they had to be working for Albert Chao. Especially the one without a neck who was roughly the size of Cleveland. He had “enforcer” written all over him.</p><p>How the hell did they know where we were?</p><p>For now, there was the simple matter of staying alive.</p><p>Luckily for him, the smaller guy was so busy talking he wasn’t bothering to watch what he was doing. One of the first things John had taught him and Sam—as soon as they were old enough—was how to defend themselves against someone with a gun.</p><p>“The best thing,” John had said, “is if they get real close. If they keep their distance, you’re in trouble, ‘cause there ain’t nothin’ you can do. But if they get close, the trick is to grab the barrel. Even if they get a shot off, your hand’ll block the slide. Now it’ll hurt like hell, but then he can’t shoot again.”</p><p>Both Dean and Sam had done that drill a thousand times, with and without their father, so when the little guy put the gun right in Dean’s face, he almost thanked him.</p><p>Three seconds later, he had the gun on the guy.</p><p>What Dean hadn’t expected was for the guy with the thyroid problem to shoot his buddy. While he did, though, Dean threw a shot into the bruiser.</p><p>But it barely slowed the big guy down, and before Dean knew it, he was eating mattress.</p><p>Then the bruiser was gone, taking the hook sword with him.</p><p>Sonofabitch.</p><p>Dean ran out after him, shoving the .45 into the waistband of his pants, covering it with his untucked flannel shirt. He wasn’t going to have much time if someone called the cops, and he had to get that sword back.</p><p>By the time he hit the street, the big guy was getting into a car that was parked in front of a fire hydrant. The Impala was a block away, and there was no way he’d catch up on foot.</p><p>No way was he going to fire a gun in the middle of Ellis Street, either.</p><p>When he walked back inside, Sam was in the hallway, but he wasn’t coming after Dean. Instead, he was walking back to the room from the other direction, carrying a bucket of ice.</p><p>Looking closely, Dean saw that Sam’s entire face was red.</p><p>“Damn—the Asian Hulk got you pretty good, huh?”</p><p>Sam nodded without speaking, entering the room and immediately wrapping ice cubes in one of the bathroom towels. Applying it gingerly to his face, he winced.</p><p>“Ow.”</p><p>“Dunno about you, but those guys screamed ‘mobster’ to me.”</p><p>Again, Sam nodded, and when he spoke there was pain in his voice.</p><p>“Yeah, it looks like Chao was ready for us—or, at least, ready for the sword. He may not be the pushover Dad thought he was.”</p><p>“Or maybe he got smart in twenty years. Either way, we gotta be more careful. And we’ve gotta try to get the sword back.”</p><p>“What do you think we should do next?”</p><p>“First we get rid of Jackie Chan here. Then I wanna take a look at that dead body from last night before we go to Shin’s Delight. Dad’s notes were good and all, but he didn’t actually see any of the bodies.”</p><p>“Think you better handle that one solo,” Sam said. “Federal agents don’t usually go into the field with their faces looking like hamburger.”</p><p>Dean grinned.</p><p>“Yeah. At least we got in some shots of our own.” Dean looked down at the dead body. “So while I’m gone, can you take care of this guy?”</p><p>Sam nodded, then winced.</p><p>“I’m on it. I’ll need you to help me get him into the car, though.”</p><p>“Yeah, I can do that.” Dean tossed the keys to Sam, who pocketed them, then put the ice-laden towel down so he could start wrapping the body up in the bedspread.</p><p>Dean, meanwhile, started to change into his suit.</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Albert was checking over the accounts on his computer, making sure all his enterprises—legitimate or not—were running smoothly. He knew that if he didn’t check regularly, one of his accountants would start skimming off the top.</p><p>It had happened once before, and Tiny had taken care of it.</p><p>Since then, he hadn’t had any problems. Indeed, that had probably been the tipping point for him. That was when he’d finally realized he didn’t need the Heart of the Dragon to do his dirty work for him.</p><p>He sat back and thought about it.</p><p>Why not turn Doragon Kokoro over to the demon, then?</p><p>Yet this was family. Nakadai was of his own flesh and blood. Didn’t that count for something?</p><p>Gary interrupted his train of thought by sprinting into the office.</p><p>“Boss!”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Tiny’s back. He got hurt!”</p><p>Albert got up.</p><p>“Where is he?” he demanded.</p><p>Gary led Albert downstairs into the back of the kitchen area. The cooks were all preparing for the lunch-hour rush, but there was a small area where Zhong kept an office.</p><p>Tiny sat in there. Ronnie was putting a bandage on his forehead, and Tiny himself was using his right hand to clutch a large bloody towel to his left shoulder.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Quickly, Tiny filled Albert in.</p><p>“Those two guys got ahold of Jake’s gun. They killed him and shot me,” Tiny said. “I was lucky to get outta there alive.”</p><p>Albert felt anger rising up in him—after all, Jake had been a decent leg-breaker—but he was more concerned about the two men.</p><p>“Did you get either of their names?”</p><p>“The shorter one was called Dean.” Tiny nodded toward a corner of the office, and Albert turned. “I got the sword, though.”</p><p>“Excellent!” Albert had always hoped to meet up with John Winchester again, and prayed fervently that these two—one of whom he now knew was named Dean—might be the accursed gaijin’s offspring. It was the one loose end he most wanted to tie up.</p><p>Winchester himself might be gone by now, but Albert could destroy the man’s sons. Family counted for everything.</p><p>But that was for later. No doubt the boys would come looking for the sword, but right now he was more concerned with his new bargaining chip. This changed everything when it came to dealing with the demon.</p><p>“Here are the bodies, Agent Seeger.”</p><p>Dean watched as the wizened old medical examiner strained to pull a drawer out from the wall. He came close to taking pity on the guy after the third time he yanked on the handle, but then he got it.</p><p>Of course, there were two bodies, so he had to go through it all over again. This time Dean did intervene.</p><p>“Lemme give you a hand.”</p><p>The M.E., whose name was Friedrich, let out a long breath.</p><p>“Yeah, thanks. Sorry, guess I ain’t as young as I used to be.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, none of us are,” Dean said gravely, remembering intimately what it had felt like to be that old. His knees still occasionally cracked, scaring the living crap out of him.…</p><p>Dean pulled open the drawer and was immediately hit by the smell of burnt flesh.</p><p>“Whoa.”</p><p>“Yeah. And this is after it’s been in the frigidaire all this time.” Friedrich shook his head. “Can’t believe this is happening again.”</p><p>Dean shot the M.E. a look.</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>Friedrich tossed a look right back at Dean.</p><p>“Yeah, again, isn’t that why you’re here?”</p><p>With the ease of long practice, Dean tap-danced.</p><p>“Well, yeah, but we’ve been, uh, keepin’ it quiet, y’know?”</p><p>“Oh, so you guys knew the score. Figures.” The M.E. turned to peer at the charred corpse. “See, when the first burned body hit a couple of weeks ago, I told the cops it had happened before. Jerks didn’t listen to a word I said, like usual. Forty-five years I’ve been doing this job, and I still can’t get anybody to take me seriously.”</p><p>Stifling a yawn he knew wouldn’t buy him any favors, Dean reached for the sheet that covered the female victim.</p><p>“Yeah, well, let’s see what we—“</p><p>He pulled it back and saw the blackened, charred flesh.</p><p>“—got.”</p><p>“See, it’s the same thing from forty years back. It was 1969—I remember, ‘cause it got lost in all that Zodiac killer crap. You remember, right? No, you’re too young—you woulda been a baby.”</p><p>Dean was tempted to point out that a blind man could see that he was too young by a full decade. But he refrained.</p><p>“I assume the COD is burning?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah, but that’s not what makes it interesting. Look at this.” The examiner pointed at the torso. While the skin was uneven, pocked and charred, there were also several straight slashes.</p><p>“This is just what happened forty years ago. There was a Fed back then, too. Bald guy—don’t remember his name. He said he’d be looking into it, but I didn’t hear bupkiss.”</p><p>This time it was a smile Dean had to conceal. A bald man claiming to be a Fed? That had to be his grandfather. Obviously these things ran in the family.…</p><p>“Didn’t solve it in ‘89, either,” Friedrich continued, “‘Course we got better toys nowadays. This time I can tell you for sure that there’s metal trace in these wounds. And it had to be antemortem.”</p><p>That surprised Dean, especially since the Heart of the Dragon’s MO was to burn and slash at the same time.</p><p>“Why do you say that?” he asked.</p><p>“Body’s too fragile. If I took a blade to this spot on the body right now, the poor girl’d fall to pieces.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Then there are other problems,” Friedrich added, pointing at the sword wounds. “Cuts like that should bleed like crazy, right? But according to the crime-scene geniuses, there was no blood at the scene, except for what was comin’ outta that guy’s nose.” He pointed at the other corpse. “And that makes no sense.”</p><p>“Maybe they both happened at the same time,” Dean offered, pointing to the burned body. “If the woman was being burned while she was being cut, it might’ve boiled the blood away.”</p><p>Friedrich squinted at Dean.</p><p>“Huh. That’s not a bad theory, actually. Well, okay, it’s not a theory, it’s a hypothesis—always bugs me, the way people call theories hypotheses, then they say, ‘Oh, it’s only a theory,’ as if it’s meaningless, but theories have data behind ‘em, and...” Friedrich drifted off. “Where was I?”</p><p>“Boiling the blood away,” Dean prompted helpfully.</p><p>“Right, yeah, okay, maybe. But that still doesn’t answer how. I mean, this kind of flash-fire could only happen if she was, I don’t know, standing on some magnesium strips or somethin’. But those same geniuses checked for that and all kindsa other incendiaries. Bupkiss. What does that tell you?”</p><p>It told Dean a great deal, but it wasn’t anything he was willing to share with a cranky old dude.</p><p>“Not sure yet,” he said. “But it is an ongoing investigation.”</p><p>“Yeah, well—first time, everyone had their heads all messed up with that Zodiac thing. And last time—hell, that was the year of the earthquake. Probably kept everybody distracted or something. I don’t know, that wasn’t actually my beat back then. But there’s somethin’ screwy here.”</p><p>“Won’t get any argument from me.” Dean pulled back the sheet on the other corpse.</p><p>“That’s another weird one,” Friedrich said, pointing at the corners of the man’s lips. “Look at that. Know what it is?”</p><p>“Sulfur,” Dean said with a sigh.</p><p>“Yeah, sulfur,” the M.E. confirmed, looking impressed. “There was some on the other body, too—almost missed it among all the burns. I mean, crazy, right?”</p><p>Dean just nodded. Suddenly, this second corpse made a lot more sense.</p><p>“Weirdest damn brain hemorrhage I ever saw, too. Usually it’s just a blood vessel. This guy burst half the ones he had in his brain. It’s like someone set off a detonator or something, yet there was no other damage.”</p><p>Yeah, it meant this poor bastard had been possessed by a demon—and whatever the demon did to him made his brain explode. Dean thought back to Castiel’s words: “A spirit is returning to this plane—one the demon hordes will be able to use in their war with the angels.” So maybe a demon was sticking its nose into things.</p><p>Dean and Sam needed to stay on their toes.</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The angel Ramiel knew that Tyler Magowan had spent much of his adult life believing three things.</p><p>That God loved him.</p><p>That angels watched over him</p><p>That some day the Pittsburgh Pirates would stop sucking.</p><p>As with most examples of faith, they were things Tyler never expected to see or experience. He would have settled for a winning season from the Bucs, though—something that hadn’t happened in his memory.</p><p>Therefore, when Ramiel came to Tyler and asked the young man to be the angel’s vessel on Earth, it surprised him—to say the least.</p><p>But not as much as it might have. Unlike most humans, who lived in blissful and willful ignorance, Tyler had noticed the signs that the Apocalypse was nigh. He’d seen such things before, and thought them to be genuine omens, but they had turned out to be random incidents.</p><p>The past six months, though, he’d seen a pattern emerging.</p><p>Ramiel came to Tyler in a dream, and spoke to him.</p><p>“The Lord needs you to give of yourself in the battle for righteousness.”</p><p>Tyler was, of course, skeptical. But Ramiel was very convincing.</p><p>“This is the wish of the Lord,” Ramiel said coaxingly. “The battle is coming, and Raphael has joined us. So, too, will Michael, whose sword will be found.”</p><p>Until the Michael sword was located, however, the angels had to hold the line against the demons. And that meant sacrifices.</p><p>Tyler was perfect. He was young, faithful, and single. He was also unemployed, another casualty of the Earth’s inevitable slide into the oblivion of Revelation. Given the opportunity to contribute in the coming battle, he would likely do so with great fire and conviction.</p><p>Ramiel had been told that there were demons gathering in San Francisco, at the same time as an interfaith conference was being held at the Moscone Convention Center. This confluence was too good for the demons to pass up—their intent was to possess many of the participants, and slaughter the rest.</p><p>The faith of the devout was one of the angels’ primary weapons, and the demoralizing effect of such an attack would be devastating on many levels. Thus Ramiel was ordered to join a contingent of angels led by Uzziel to stop the demons.</p><p>Ironically, before Ramiel had revealed himself, Tyler had been planning to attend this conference with several other members of his church. Without hesitation, he agreed.</p><p>The vast complex of Moscone Center took up an entire city block, with streets on all four sides. When Tyler/Ramiel first arrived, led by Uzziel and accompanied by a dozen other followers, they sensed no demonic presence—disappointing, but not unexpected. Demons were always finding ways to hide themselves. And he had been told from the outset that it was possible that their intelligence was faulty.</p><p>Nevertheless, the angels easily infiltrated the conference, pretending to be attendees. For all that it called itself “interfaith,” Ramiel realized quickly that it was truly a Judeo-Christian gathering. Still, the two religions—fractured though they were in this modern age—maintained considerable common ground, as well as a desire to exercise greater influence over humanity. They longed to wield the sort of influence their ancestors had enjoyed.</p><p>Ramiel thought it was a waste of time. True, everyone in medieval Europe had believed in God, and worshipped and swore fealty to the church, but they had done so because they knew no other way. It was faith by habit. Far fewer people in the modern day’s so-called “Western Civilization” considered themselves religious.</p><p>Yet in modern America, those who did believe truly believed—not because they had to, but because they wanted to. That was true faith, Ramiel thought. Tyler Magowan didn’t consider himself a Christian out of family tradition or fear that he’d be ostracized from his community if he wasn’t. He simply considered himself a Christian, and conducted himself as one.</p><p>Better to have one devout follower than a hundred rote ones, Ramiel decided.</p><p>Not everyone agreed, however. He had made the mistake of mentioning this preference to Uriel, which had led to a lengthy diatribe on the subject of human ingratitude. Uriel described the rampant lack of faith as “the mud monkeys abusing their own free will.”</p><p>But Ramiel held his tongue. He had always felt that the whole point of being an angel was to see the best in things. And when Uriel turned out to be a traitor, it had reinforced this conviction.</p><p>One thing Ramiel couldn’t reconcile was all the death. Too many of his brothers and sisters weren’t here now because they’d died—whether in service of the Lord, as victims of the betrayal by Uriel and his allies, or at the hands of demons.</p><p>He hoped this day wouldn’t add to the ranks of the fallen.</p><p>With Uzziel, Jophiel, and Selaphiel alongside him, Ramiel went to a session that was being held in Room 105, which was one of the conference rooms just outside the exhibit hall on the convention center’s lower level. The hall itself was currently empty—unlike many who used Moscone’s services, the conference boasted no exhibitors peddling their wares or promoting their services. The sole purpose of this conference was for people of faith to talk to one another.</p><p>Room 105 revealed a dozen people gathered in a circle. Most of them were well dressed. One was a Lubavitcher, and he had on a black-and-white suit and sported a full beard and a full head of curly hair sticking out from under his hat. Another was dressed in the black shirt and collar of a Catholic priest.</p><p>The rest were in suits.</p><p>As with every other room they’d entered in the Moscone Center, this one was bereft of any demonic presence.</p><p>In the seat that faced the door sat a woman in a lime green pantsuit. She wore a brooch that was oddly familiar.</p><p>“Hello,” she said, “have you come to join our colloquy?”</p><p>Uzziel smiled and spoke in a deep, resonant voice. His host was a pediatrician named Pierce—a large, powerfully built African American who had used that voice to convince his patients that it would only hurt for a minute.</p><p>“No, thank you,” he replied. “We’d just like to observe, if that’s all right.”</p><p>“By all means,” the woman said.</p><p>Suddenly, Ramiel recognized the brooch—or, more specifically, recognized the stone in the brooch’s center.</p><p>There were only four in existence, and three of them were safely hidden in a church in Cordoba. Ramiel had put them there himself in the fourth century, and if the wards he’d placed around them had been penetrated any time in the subsequent 1700 years, he’d have known.</p><p>They had been created by Bishop Hyginus of Cordoba in A.D. 381, the year after the bishop had conspired to have an ascetic named Priscillian executed for heresy. Priscillian had learned that Hyginus was consorting with demons, and Hyginus had used his demonic allies to help convince Pope Damascus I to have Priscillian condemned.</p><p>Hyginus had created the four stones to hide a demon’s essence within a possessed body, even from an angel. Ramiel had been sent to confiscate the stones. He had succeeded in retrieving three of them and casting out the demon who had lured Hyginus away from the Lord. Ironically, history would remember Hyginus as a devout Christian who had rid the church of a heretic, and Priscillian as one of the first such heretics.</p><p>And Ramiel had never been able to locate the fourth stone.</p><p>Now, standing in Room 105 of the Moscone Center, Ramiel didn’t hesitate, didn’t give the demons a chance to tip their hands. Nor did he let them know they’d been discovered.</p><p>Instead, without a word, he struck.</p><p>With but a gesture, he knocked the woman in the pantsuit to the ground.</p><p>The angels all turned to stare at him as if he were mad, and only then did he speak.</p><p>“She wears the missing Stone of Hyginus!”</p><p>The priest jumped up.</p><p>“What on Earth are you people doing?”</p><p>Next to him, a man in a charcoal suit and a Liberty of London tie backhanded the priest.</p><p>“Shut up, already, will you?” he snarled.</p><p>Several chairs started to leap into the air and ricochet off of the walls. Ramiel ducked the one that had been aimed at his head, and it careened away.</p><p>“Figures,” the demon with the stone said as its vessel got to her feet. “We get stuck with the one halo who knows what an ancient stone looks like.”</p><p>Ramiel leapt across at that demon, catching her squarely in the chest and kicking her across the room. He let his momentum carry him, and then stood over her, shaking his head.</p><p>“Only a demon would think of a mere 1700 years as ‘ancient.’” His look reflected his contempt. “You’re pathetic little creatures.”</p><p>“Blah blah blah,” the demon said, rising slowly as her eyes went pitch black. “Put it in your wings and rub it, halo.”</p><p>Suddenly she let loose with a kick of her own that sent the angel crashing into the table with what might have been a bone-jarring impact. It was Ramiel’s turn to scramble upright, and as he prepared for the demon to follow through, he glanced quickly around the room.</p><p>Uzziel had grabbed one of the demons by the head. Smoke poured out of the vessel’s mouth, eyes, nose, and ears, dissipating into nothingness even as the man screamed in agony.</p><p>The demon with the stone leapt at Ramiel again. Letting his vessel’s body go limp, Ramiel let the momentum of her leap carry them through the thin wall that separated Room 105 from a lower-level exhibit hall.</p><p>Hitting the hard ground, rolling and getting to his feet, Ramiel faced the demon, standing on the bare concrete.</p><p>“Is this really the best you can do?” he asked, his words echoing in the cavernously empty hall.</p><p>Grinning, the demon also rose.</p><p>“Don’t worry, I’m just gettin’ started.”</p><p>She reached into a pocket of the pantsuit and pulled out a knife. Ramiel recognized it as similar to the one Castiel had carried, and he wasn’t about to let the demon do anything with it. He reached out and snatched it from her grip.</p><p>She offered surprisingly little resistance.</p><p>And then Ramiel found he couldn’t raise his arms. Or stay on his feet.</p><p>His knees felt as if they were crumbling to dust.</p><p>His eyesight started to fail, but with a squint he was able to make out the vicious smile on the face of the demon’s vessel.</p><p>“Not feeling so hot, are you, halo? See, I’ve been doing some collecting. Hyginus’s little trinket was just one of my babies, and me and my buddies are—“</p><p>The rest of her sentence was cut off by a hand that appeared on her head.</p><p>“No! No! Yaaaaaaaarrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrhhhhhhhh!”</p><p>Smoke oozed out of every orifice. Moments later the vessel collapsed to the concrete floor, dead. Her screams continued to echo through the hall.</p><p>Only when she had fallen could Ramiel see—barely— that it was Uzziel, recognizable because of his vessel’s imposing size.</p><p>Still the life was draining from him.</p><p>Ramiel dropped the knife to the concrete floor.</p><p>“Destroy it, quickly, Uzziel, before.…”</p><p>Uzziel winced as the angelus iuguolo claimed Ramiel. He watched the body of Tyler Magowan die, and with it the angel who possessed him.</p><p>Uzziel had always liked Ramiel. He had a good heart— even by the high standards of the angels—and had been a fine warrior in the Lord’s cause.</p><p>Even if the Lord himself hadn’t been much in evidence lately.</p><p>Like many of the higher angels, Uzziel was tired of it. Tired of guiding a humanity that neither wanted nor appreciated their help. After centuries of wars, plagues, tyranny, sin—the Apocalypse was something of a relief.</p><p>He had thought the twentieth century, with so many genocides, had been the worst ever. Then the twenty-first had begun with lunatics killing each other by the thousands, in every corner of the globe, and Uzziel knew it wasn’t going to get any better.</p><p>When Zachariah came to him with a plan to bring about the end of days—and sooner rather than wait around for it—Uzziel was on board in an instant.</p><p>The only part he hadn’t liked was deceiving his fellow angels. Not even when the goal was to draw out Doragon Kokoro. The angels had been certain that this assault was going to be the spirit’s coming-out party, after which he would serve as a powerful weapon in the hands of demonkind.</p><p>Few realized just how powerful a weapon the damned samurai would be in the right—or wrong—hands. In so evenly balanced a match, his role could be the tipping point. Zachariah knew that, and he had convinced Uzziel.</p><p>When the angelic counter-strike was announced, nobody questioned the orders. Why should they? The host had a very rigid chain of command, and opinions were discouraged. After all, they usually led to betrayal, as had been shown by Castiel.</p><p>And Uriel.</p><p>And Lucifer.</p><p>As it was, the angels had courted disaster. Ramiel’s presence had proved a blessing, since Uzziel never would have recognized the Stone of Hyginus. Sadly, Ramiel had paid the ultimate price via the angelus iuguolo—but so had six of the seven demons, thanks to Uzziel, Jophiel, and Selaphiel. Only one of the creatures had managed to get away.</p><p>Ramiel’s sacrifice had served to prove an even greater truth—one Uzziel had suspected all along.</p><p>Father had abandoned them. They were on their own.</p><p>With a gesture, he atomized the knife. Never again would it claim a sibling.</p><p>Then he removed the brooch from the corpse of the woman in the green pantsuit. He planned to place it with the others in Cordoba. Ramiel would, he knew, have wanted it that way.</p><p>Leaving the human corpses behind—they were humanity’s problem now and not the concern of the host— Uzziel went back to Room 105 to gather up the surviving angels.</p><p>And the war raged on.</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Marcus Wallace lay dying.</p><p>The heart attack had come out of nowhere. But then, that was the way of the heart attack—that most unpredictable of killers. Marcus had always laughed at reports of “a sudden heart attack.”</p><p>As if there were any other kind.</p><p>He’d been sitting in his office, grading papers, when his left arm started to hurt. Then he’d had trouble breathing, with fatigue overwhelming him, his body tensing even as he lost control of his limbs.</p><p>Somehow, he wound up on the floor.</p><p>The new secretary—the one whose name he couldn’t quite remember—came running in, cried out in shock, and then grabbed Marcus’s desk phone and called 911.</p><p>And after that, he must have been hallucinating, because the secretary looked down at him.</p><p>And smiled viciously.</p><p>He woke up in the emergency room of the Alta Bates Summit Medical Center on Ashby Avenue, surrounded by a doctor and five nurses who told him he was lucky to be alive.</p><p>Since then, they’d admitted him, UC-Berkeley’s medical coverage being more than sufficient to pay for a stay in a four-person room that currently only had three people occupying it.</p><p>For twenty-four hours, nurses came in and checked on him and ran tests and poked and prodded. None of them would answer any of Marcus’s questions beyond the platitudes he’d received when he woke up in the ER.</p><p>Marcus was pushing seventy. He had gotten used to medical professionals being parsimonious with useful information. Everything was “precautionary,” they didn’t want to “jump to conclusions,” it was always “too early to tell.”</p><p>Finally, a doctor came in. He was a familiar-looking Asian man with a crew-cut and round cheeks.</p><p>“Hi, Mr. Wallace, I’m Doctor—“</p><p>“Takashi Iwamura.”</p><p>The doctor grinned sheepishly as he reached for the clipboard that hung from a hook at the foot of the bed.</p><p>“I was rather hoping you wouldn’t remember me, Professor.”</p><p>Marcus laughed, an action that sent shooting pains through his entire ribcage.</p><p>“No, I, uh—woo.”</p><p>The grin fell.</p><p>“Take it easy, Professor.”</p><p>Marcus waved him off.</p><p>“I’m fine—just shouldn’t have laughed,” he said, and he caught his breath. “No, it’s good to see you. Been a few years since you were three steps from flunking out of my folklore class, Hash. You still go by ‘Hash’?”</p><p>That prompted another sheepish grin.</p><p>“No matter how hard I try not to.”</p><p>“Well, as long as my heart’s in your hands, I’ll stick with ‘Dr. Iwamura.’”</p><p>“Hash is fine, Professor. And speaking of your heart.…”</p><p>“Yeah.” Marcus tugged at the sheets that covered him from the chest down. “What’s the verdict? And please—no crap, all right? I prefer Gregory House to Marcus Welby.”</p><p>Iwamura shrugged as he hung the clipboard back on the hook.</p><p>“Fair enough. You had a cardiac infarction and came within a hairsbreadth of dying.” He paused briefly before continuing. “Now, this is the part where I’d give you all kinds of reassurances, tell you that there are treatments and medications and diets and all sorts of things. But you want straight, so you’ll get straight.</p><p>“You’ve got a heart that doesn’t like you very much. It’s like a fight with your wife or girlfriend or boyfriend or whoever—you can buy all the flowers you want and apologize all you want, but there’s no guarantee you’ll be taken back.”</p><p>Marcus thought about that for a moment.</p><p>“So I could take meds that make me sick, eat food I can’t stand, and still keel over in six months?”</p><p>Iwamura nodded.</p><p>“But the chances are reduced significantly, if you do all that.”</p><p>“Great.” Marcus let out a long breath. “Okay, thanks for the straight shooting, Hash.”</p><p>Putting a hand on his shoulder, Iwamura spoke gently.</p><p>“Get some rest, Professor. You’ve got students to terrorize, after all.”</p><p>That prompted a smile.</p><p>“I only terrorize the students who don’t appreciate the material. I’m sure your med-school professors were a lot easier on you.”</p><p>Iwamura coughed a laugh.</p><p>“Well, I don’t know if I’d go that far...” he said.</p><p>After Iwamura left, Marcus looked over at the telephone that sat on the table next to his bed. The siren call of voicemail nagged at him.</p><p>He looked around, and saw that the other patients in the room were unconscious. Pretty sure he wouldn’t disturb them, he reached for the receiver. When he’d started teaching forty-five years ago, he barely even used the phone in his office. He communicated with students in person, during office hours— which were posted on a piece of paper tacked to a bulletin board—and before and after classes.</p><p>Now, he rarely had a face-to-face with his students. It was all email or texting or instant messaging or cell phones. He even had his office phone automatically forward to his Treo. He spent little time in his office these days, anyhow.</p><p>At his age, and having had tenure for years, his class load was lighter than it had ever been, and he preferred to spend his leisure time relaxing. Sometimes he’d cross the Bay Bridge into San Francisco and browse through City Lights, or he’d wander the used bookstores here in Berkeley.</p><p>If a student needed to talk to him, the call would go right to his pocket.</p><p>Unlike many of his contemporaries—who bitched and moaned about it—Marcus actually preferred it this way.</p><p>His favorite was Dr. Wang.</p><p>“They can call me any time, now. What if I don’t want to talk to them?”</p><p>Marcus’s response was always the same.</p><p>“Cell phone’s got an ‘off’ button. Use it—I do. If I don’t want to be reached, I can shut the thing down and they can eat voicemail.”</p><p>He liked not subjecting himself—or his students—to the tyranny of office hours. So many issues that would have been disastrous twenty years ago never even came up, precisely because the students had improved access to their teachers.</p><p>His Treo had been in his jacket pocket when he’d suffered the heart attack, which meant it was still draped over the cracked leather chair where he’d left it. His laptop still sat on his desk. Without either of those, checking his email was impossible—despite the nurse’s reassurance that the hospital had wi-fi.</p><p>However, the landline next to his bed would, at least, allow him to remotely access his voicemail. So he gave in to temptation, and punched in the numbers.</p><p>He had six messages, so he grabbed a pen and paper.</p><p>The first three were from his students with assorted concerns, none of which he had to sweat until after he was released from the hospital. However, he did copy down their numbers so he could let them know that it would be more than a day or two to get back to them, and for good reason. Knowing the campus grapevine, he expected they already knew what had happened, but Marcus preferred the personal touch.</p><p>The next message was from his nephew, and Marcus was tempted to delete it without listening.</p><p>“Yo, Unc, some white dude was lookin’ for you. Said he met a friend’a yours in Chinatown or somethin’ like that. Bought me a beer, so I told him you worked at the hippie school. Just wanted to give you a heads-up, yo. Peace.”</p><p>Marcus sighed. At least he wasn’t asking for money this time. The final message came from an unfamiliar voice.</p><p>“Hi, Professor, this is Sam Winchester—I’m calling on behalf of myself and my brother Dean. Twenty years ago you met our father, John Winchester, and I think you know Bobby Singer, too. We’re in San Francisco because the Heart of the Dragon’s back, and we need your help. If you could call me back, please, that would be great.” Then he gave his cell number. The call ended, and Marcus just stared at the phone.</p><p>“Son of a bitch.”</p><p>He found it hard to believe that it had been twenty years since a frighteningly intense John Winchester had come into his office complaining about the hook sword he had given to Jack Bartow. Marcus had thought the man was going to take his head off. From the sound of it, his son was a lot nicer. At the very least, he was more polite.</p><p>But that thought was supplanted by another—this one much more ominous.</p><p>If Doragon Kokoro was back, all hell was gonna break loose. So reading the number off of the note pad, he returned Sam Winchester’s phone call.</p><p>“Hello?” It was the same voice, slightly out of breath.</p><p>“Sam Winchester? This is Marcus Wallace.”</p><p>“Oh, hi, Professor. Can you hold on one second?”</p><p>“Uh, sure,” Marcus said, and it sounded as if the young man set his phone down, followed by what sounded like a shovel digging into dirt.</p><p>After a few more seconds, Sam Winchester came back on the line.</p><p>“Sorry about that—needed to finish something up.” As he spoke, Marcus heard the sound of a car engine starting.</p><p>“That’s all right, son,” Marcus replied. “How’s your old man doing?”</p><p>“Uh, well, I’m afraid he passed a few years ago.”</p><p>Marcus winced.</p><p>“Damn. Sorry about that. He seemed like an okay guy.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Sam sounded awkward. In the background, the traffic noises increased—as if he had just entered a freeway. Whatever the case, he quickly got down to business.</p><p>“I’m glad you called, Professor. We’ve got a bit of a problem.”</p><p>“Your message said something about Doragon Kokoro’s return.”</p><p>“Uh, yeah, and it gets worse,” Sam said. “Some guys came by our hotel and took the hook sword away from us. We figure it was Albert Chao.”</p><p>“Probably, yeah.” Marcus blew out a very long breath. “Well, I’d say you guys are screwed then—and so are the rest of us. You gotta get that thing back.”</p><p>“That’s what I was hoping you could help us with. We need to find the sword again. Chao probably has it at his restaurant, but it’d be good if we could be sure before we try to retrieve it.”</p><p>“Crap.” Marcus closed his eyes and thought for a moment. He’d never needed to locate the sword before, because he always knew where it was. Or at least that it was in the right hands.</p><p>Even better, he’d put all his notes on Doragon Kokoro into a folder on his laptop. Which, of course, was back at his office.</p><p>Why is this never easy?</p><p>“All right,” he said, “I’m gonna need you or your brother to do me a favor.”</p><p>“Just name it.”</p><p>“You need to stop by my office. It’s at 2223 Fulton Street in Berkeley. There’s a laptop on my desk. Grab it and bring it to me here at the hospital.”</p><p>“Hospital?” Sam sounded confused.</p><p>Marcus shook his head. He couldn’t possibly have known.</p><p>“Yeah, had me a heart attack yesterday. I’m in Room 209 of the Medical Center on Ashby Avenue.”</p><p>“Where on Ashby?”</p><p>“Uh, dunno the address—it’s right off Telegraph.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll find it,” Sam hesitated and continued. “And Professor, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Marcus dismissed the sentiment with a wave—not that there was anyone who could see it.</p><p>“Forget about it—you didn’t know,” he said. “And hurry—we can’t afford to screw around.”</p><p>“Okay. I’m on 580 heading toward Berkeley right now. Should be there in ten to fifteen minutes or so.”</p><p>“Good—and hey, Sam?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“There are no guarantees here. I never needed to look for the sword before, so I don’t know if my notes will give us anything that’ll find it.”</p><p>“Yeah, I kinda figured that.” Sam paused. “It’s still worth a shot, though.”</p><p>“Oh, definitely. I just don’t want you getting your hopes up.” Marcus remembered how persnickety Sam’s father got, and didn’t want to take the chance that the son had inherited that trait.</p><p>“I stopped getting my hopes up a long time ago, Professor,” Sam said, his voice sounding incredibly tired.</p><p>“Yeah, I can appreciate that. Call me when you get to the office.” He gave Sam the hospital phone number, then they disconnected.</p><p>Lying there in silence, he thought about John Winchester. The man had radiated intensity, a singularity of purpose. Jack Bartow had been a lot more laid back. He knew what he was doing and didn’t mess around, but he took things relatively easy.</p><p>Winchester, though, was different—he’d carried himself as if his entire existence depended on destroying the spirit.</p><p>Of course, neither of them had succeeded in doing so.</p><p>If Sam Winchester is anything like his father, then it’s no wonder he sounded the way he did.</p><p>The next thing Marcus knew, he was woken by the noise of the phone ringing. He hadn’t even realized he’d fallen asleep.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>A deep voice spoke.</p><p>“Is this Marcus Wallace?”</p><p>“Uh, yeah.” Who the hell...?</p><p>“Dean Winchester—Sam’s brother. We got the laptop, and we’re headin’ down to you right now.”</p><p>“Great—I’ll see you shortly.” He started to hang up, then pulled the receiver back again. “And hey, like I told your brother, I can’t promise nothin’. I may not be able to find the thing for you.”</p><p>“Yeah, we get that a lot.” Dean sounded at least as tired as his brother. “See you in a few.”</p><p>Marcus hung up the hospital phone, and then rubbed the sleep from his eyes. His connections to the weird world Bartow, Singer, and the Winchester family lived in were tenuous at best. These guys lived it.</p><p>It had to have taken its toll.</p><p>He glanced around to find that both of his roommates were gone. One bed still had a chart on it, so the guy was probably just off getting tests or something.</p><p>The other one had no chart—maybe he checked out.</p><p>One way or the other, he thought bleakly.</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>“Hi, Professor!”</p><p>Looking up, Marcus saw the secretary whose name he still couldn’t remember. Despite this, he did recall that she’d been the one who found him and called 911.</p><p>“Hey!” he replied with enthusiasm.</p><p>She was a mousy little Japanese-American woman with dark hair tied into a ponytail. She had a very bright smile, and was wearing a gray trench coat.</p><p>As she walked up to the bed, she seemed to be clutching her purse, as if hanging on for dear life.</p><p>“I just wanted to see how you were doing, Professor,” she said. “I was so frightened when I saw you collapse like that.”</p><p>“Yeah, me, too,” Marcus admitted ruefully. “But hey, you were the one who called 911, so thanks for that.”</p><p>“Oh, of course! It would be terrible if you died!” Then she leaned in close and spoke in a whisper. “Heart attacks are so—so horrible, aren’t they?”</p><p>Marcus didn’t bother whispering back, since they were the only two people in the room.</p><p>“Definitely. I’m in no rush to have another one.”</p><p>Then something about her changed—and abruptly. Her bright smile took on a different aspect, though he couldn’t exactly say how. With a start, he remembered the strange look she’d given him, right before he blacked out, back at the office.</p><p>Her tone changed with her expression.</p><p>“Then you’d best tell me what I want to hear.”</p><p>The smile disappeared, and her eyes went completely black.</p><p>Marcus hadn’t thought there could be a worse sensation than having a heart attack, but seeing the secretary’s eyes suddenly go dark gave him a horrible feeling deep in the pit of his stomach.</p><p>“You’re gonna help me, Prof,” she said, a rumbling undertone to her words. “According to the grapevine, you’re the guy to talk to about the spirit of Yoshio Nakadai. I need to take charge of that spirit. Y’see, there’s a war on, and my side’s been taking a bit of a pounding. I just got my ass kicked and watched six of my buddies die a horrible death because I didn’t come through. I’m pretty damn pissed about that, so I’m tired of assing around. I want the Heart of the Dragon back. And that leads me oh-so-nicely to you.” As she spat out those last few words, the smile returned.</p><p>Marcus said nothing. Whatever this creature was, it wasn’t on the side of the angels.</p><p>Her face loomed over him, the black eyes deep, hypnotic pools.</p><p>“The sword that can be used to bring the spirit to heel,” she continued. “I need it. And you’re going to tell me where it is.”</p><p>Marcus stared back at the creature.</p><p>“Sorry. Can’t tell you,” he said, fighting to keep the fear out of his voice.</p><p>The creature snarled, a noise that was both frightening and repellant coming from such a delicate-looking form.</p><p>“Oh, you think so?”</p><p>“Think’s got nothing to do with it,” Marcus said. “I don’t know where it is, and I don’t know how to find it.” He assumed it was with Chao, but even the Winchester boys weren’t completely sure of that.</p><p>For several long moments those obsidian eyes stared at him. It was as if this monster was looking right into his soul.</p><p>“Huh,” she said finally. “Looks like you’re telling the truth. Well, that sucks.” Then the awful smile came back again. “For you, anyhow.”</p><p>Marcus’s left arm started to hurt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and Dean were about to enter Professor Wallace’s room when several people in scrubs ran in ahead of them, all shouting at each other.</p><p>“Helluva time to wind up in an ER episode,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Sam had called Dean following his phone call with the professor and after he had finished burying the gangster’s body near the Richmond Inner Harbor.</p><p>Rather than deal with going all the way back into San Francisco, then doubling back to Berkeley, Dean had taken the bus from the medical examiner’s office to the Civic Center BART station, then the red line to Berkeley. Sam had met him at the station, and they had gone straight to the Asian Studies office to fetch Wallace’s laptop and then on to the hospital.</p><p>A short Asian woman backed out of the hospital room, guided by a nurse. She was crying.</p><p>“Professor Wallace! Professor Wallace!” she wailed.</p><p>“Please, ma’am, you need to stay back,” the nurse said in a vaguely reassuring tone. “We’ll try to save him.”</p><p>Dean walked up to the woman.</p><p>“Excuse me—what happened to Professor Wallace?”</p><p>She looked up at him, tears streaming down her cheeks. He thought she had a nice Lucy Liu vibe going.</p><p>“I don’t know! We were just talking, and he started acting all weird, and the monitors beeped and it was awful!”</p><p>Looking up, he saw that Sam was peering into the room.</p><p>“They’re working on him,” he reported, turning around as he spoke.</p><p>“Crap,” Dean huffed through his teeth. Even if the docs pulled Wallace’s ass out of the fire again, it’d be hours before he’d be conscious, much less able to have visitors.</p><p>Turning back to the young woman, he tried to figure out a way to gracefully excuse himself from her presence. If she knew Wallace, she probably wouldn’t be all that thrilled with them having his personal laptop.</p><p>But before he could say anything, she lurched against him, gripping his bicep with one hand. She wasn’t heavy, but he didn’t dare move for fear of letting her drop to the floor.</p><p>“Uh.…” He looked helplessly at his brother.</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” the woman said breathlessly. “Need air.”</p><p>“Let’s, uh—let’s get you outside, okay? We can check back on the professor in a little while?”</p><p>“Yes,” she whispered. “Thank you.”</p><p>Sam stared at Dean, who just glared back.</p><p>What else am I supposed to do?</p><p>Once they got out into the parking lot, the woman steadied herself and spoke with a stronger voice.</p><p>“Thanks very much, Dean.”</p><p>“Sure, no—“</p><p>Then he backed away quickly, his hand moving to the inner pocket of his suit jacket. His fingers closed around the deer-antler handle of Ruby’s demon-killing knife.</p><p>“Drop the act, sister.”</p><p>The woman took on a nasty grin, and the black eyes of a demon.</p><p>“Ah, well, it was worth a shot. Guy like you, figured you’d want to rescue the hot Asian chick. Got that whole Lucy Liu thing going, right?”</p><p>Ahhh, crap. But Dean didn’t take the bait.</p><p>“You have three seconds to vamoose, chuckles.”</p><p>“Not that easy, boys,” she said, looking at Sam who had followed them outside. “See, you two are even more valuable than that hook sword. Maybe even more valuable than the spirit of Nakadai.”</p><p>Years of playing poker kept Dean’s expression neutral.</p><p>The demon continued to address his younger brother.</p><p>“You look awful, Sam. Really, you should take better care of yourself,” the creature chided. “After all, you are Lucifer’s vessel. It doesn’t do for you to be all bruised up.” She shook her head. “Damn me. The Michael sword and Lucifer’s vessel. I’ve really hit the jackpot.”</p><p>Dean removed the knife from his jacket.</p><p>“So’ve we.”</p><p>Her face fell.</p><p>“Awww, screw it!”</p><p>The woman’s head tipped back and smoke poured out of her mouth, cascading upward into the sky.</p><p>She collapsed to the ground.</p><p>“C’mon,” Dean said, making a beeline for the Impala. “This is bigger than we thought. We’ve gotta make tracks.”</p><p>“Dean—“ Sam started, but Dean cut him off.</p><p>“We’re in a hospital parking lot,” he said while fishing the keys from his pants pocket. “Someone’ll help her, and we need to get out of here before he tells his demon buddies where we are. We may be hidden from them thanks to Castiel, but Sam, we’ve been made.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Sam muttered as he ran to catch up his brother. “You’re right.”</p><p>Minutes later the Impala was heading toward I-80 and the Bay Bridge.</p><p>“Well, that sucked,” Dean said.</p><p>“At least we’ve got the laptop,” Sam said. “When we get back to the hotel, I’ll see if I can find anything.”</p><p>“If there’s anything there to find.” Dean pounded the steering wheel with one hand. “He wasn’t even sure. And I’m willing to bet Wallace’s heart attack had some encouragement from Smokey the Hot Asian Chick.”</p><p>“Probably so, yeah.”</p><p>“You got an hour,” Dean said.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Sam replied.</p><p>“We get back, I change into real clothes, and you take an hour to try to find something. Then we go to Shin’s Delight, no matter what you find. That’s Chao’s HQ, so that’s where the dead samurai must be. If there’s a demon jonesing for this spirit, too.…”</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“Yeah, the stakes are higher than we thought.”</p><p>“Certainly explains why Cass was the one who gave us the heads-up. Maybe the demons figure a guy like that’d come in handy in a fight.”</p><p>“Or the angels,” Sam suggested.</p><p>“Yeah, or the angels.” Dean figured most of angel-kind was no better than the demons they fought. In some ways they were worse—having been to Hell, Dean understood how damned souls got that way.</p><p>Angels had no excuse.</p><p>After crossing the bridge, Dean navigated the streets of San Francisco. The first time he’d driven here, it had set his teeth on edge. He spent most of his time on interstates, and even when they went through hilly or mountainous areas, they tended to be mostly flat. But where highways were built by demolishing bits of land to keep the road as flat as possible, the local streets in San Francisco were just draped over the hills.</p><p>On that first visit Dean was twenty and Sam was still in high school. John was asleep in the passenger seat, and Dean hadn’t wanted to wake him.</p><p>By the time they arrived at their destination in the Mission, he thought his knuckles were going to be permanently white. And he let his father drive out, once they took care of business.</p><p>But he’d adjusted over the years, to the point where it almost didn’t bother him when the Impala felt as if it was at a right angle to the ground.</p><p>They entered the lobby of their hotel to find Castiel sitting on one of the badly upholstered sofas, staring straight ahead into space.</p><p>“Cass?” Dean said.</p><p>Castiel rose from the sofa and stared right at him.</p><p>“We need to talk.”</p><p>“When don’t we?” Then Dean shook his head, and shrugged in the direction of the stairs. “C’mon.”</p><p>When they got back to the room, Sam took his position at the desk and opened Wallace’s laptop, while Dean sat on his bed. Castiel just stood in the middle of the floor.</p><p>“There was a battle at the convention center downtown,” Castiel said. “Ramiel was killed, as were half a dozen demons. The Heart of the Dragon isn’t in play yet, but it’s only a matter of time.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean sighed, “we got a taste of that.” He told Castiel about their encounter at the hospital. The angel just stared, his face impassive.</p><p>“The Heart of the Dragon must be stopped. His power has been gestating for more than a century. Under the influence of demons, he might very well tip the scales.”</p><p>“Well, I’m open to suggestions,” Dean said. “Without the sword—“</p><p>Suddenly, the room felt incredibly hot—particularly in the direction of the bathroom.</p><p>Whirling around and springing to his feet, Dean saw a man surrounded by fire.</p><p>He had to admit, it was an impressive sight. His experience with samurais had been limited to Toshiro Mifune movies and John Belushi skits, so to see one in real life was kind of cool.</p><p>The spirit didn’t move, nor did the flames spread. Nonetheless, Dean pulled out the demon-killing knife.</p><p>Castiel’s voice sounded tighter than usual.</p><p>“Won’t... work.…”</p><p>Dean looked over to see that Castiel was concentrating furiously—it seemed he was keeping the Heart of the Dragon in check.</p><p>Then the spirit spoke.</p><p>“You do not have the sword?”</p><p>Dean was caught off guard—the figure was speaking Japanese, but somehow he actually understood the words, if not the meaning.</p><p>“Say what?” he responded.</p><p>“I am under instructions from my descendant to slay you both, but this creature is holding me at bay,” the spirit intoned in a deep, hollow voice. “This is good, for you may be able to free me, but only if you wield the sword.”</p><p>Getting up from his position at the desk, Sam addressed the figure.</p><p>“The sword was taken from us, we think by Albert Chao. We’re trying to locate it—“</p><p>“Ah, Albert Chao,” the figure said. “My descendant has planned more skillfully this time, it seems. However, he is not a trusting soul. If he ordered the sword taken from you, then he is keeping it close. You must find it—and when you do, you may finally free me.”</p><p>“I don’t understand,” Sam said, “how will it free you? Casting the spell on the sword will just banish you for another twenty years, won’t it?”</p><p>“You must cast the spell on me as you pierce my heart with the sword’s edge. Only then may I be free.”</p><p>Dean shook his head. Sometimes trial and error really sucked. If Dad had known this twenty years ago, a lot of people would still be alive.</p><p>Then the spirit raised his sword.</p><p>“Cass!” Dean cried.</p><p>Sweat was beading on Castiel’s forehead.</p><p>“I’m trying.…”</p><p>“I am sorry,” the Heart of the Dragon said, even as he advanced on Dean.</p><p>A report roared in Dean’s ears, and the spirit disappeared in a flash of light, the flames constricting and collapsing into nothingness.</p><p>Glancing back he saw Sam holding a smoking shotgun, which was, as always, loaded with rock-salt rounds.</p><p>“Nice shot,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam smiled mirthlessly.</p><p>“Nice to know the classics still work.”</p><p>“Yeah, more people ought to keep those things handy— save a lotta grief,” Dean agreed. He started undoing his tie. “We need to get a move on. The rock salt’ll only keep Yojimbo there on ice for a little while, and Chao’s gonna be pretty pissed when he finds out his pet spirit screwed the pooch.” Pulling the tie from around his neck, he looked at Sam. “You got ten minutes to find something we can use. Then we motor to Chinatown.”</p><p>Sam nodded and sat down, hunching over the laptop.</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Albert Chao had been trying to summon the spirit of his ancestor for the best part of an hour, but to no avail.</p><p>In his youth, patience had never been one of his virtues. In fact, looking back, he was hard-pressed to find any recognizable virtues at all. He had been a killer, a cheat, and a fool. All those years of inadequacy, and he had blamed it all on people other than himself. Unwilling to accept his own failures, he instead castigated his parents for birthing him, Chinese society for ostracizing half-breeds, racist whites for their treatment of Asians.…</p><p>Yet he was hardly the only half-breed in San Francisco. He was hardly the only person to suffer misfortunes. But back then he thought his problems were so special that he needed occult intervention. He thought it would solve everything.</p><p>It had been a supremely foolish decision, he realized now, to allow himself to make use of a demon’s plaything.</p><p>But the damage was done. All he could do was move forward.</p><p>Finally he was able to bring the spirit to him. As the fiery creature appeared in the center of the office, Albert found himself surprisingly unmoved. Forty years ago, in a tiny apartment in the Mission, he’d never seen anything so glorious. The possibilities seemed endless, then, and he’d felt the spirit’s power as if it were a tangible thing.</p><p>Now, he just saw a dead samurai wreathed in flames.</p><p>Albert had power—he didn’t need the spirit.</p><p>“What happened?” he demanded.</p><p>“I was unable to carry out your orders, my descendant. The two men had a being of great power by their side, and he was able to keep me at bay until one of them used a firearm. Somehow it banished me.”</p><p>“How banal.” From what Oscar had told him, that was probably a shotgun with rock salt. Standard issue for hunters.</p><p>“Then it was fitting for such a banal task,” the spirit said.</p><p>Albert looked up and stared into the fiery eyes of his ancestor.</p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p>“You sent me to kill these two men—these ‘Winchesters’—in a childish show of revenge. It is no different from the foul tasks you had me undertake when first you summoned me.”</p><p>Albert shrugged.</p><p>“An indulgence. I cannot avenge myself on their father, so.…” He trailed off.</p><p>Why had he sent the spirit of his ancestor after the sons of John Winchester? He already had the sword, so he need have nothing else to do with them. True, they would likely come after him, and a preemptive strike was justifiable in that regard.</p><p>But that wasn’t why he had done it.</p><p>“You resist the demon’s imploring,” the Heart of the Dragon said. “Why?”</p><p>“How can you ask that?” Albert said.</p><p>“The demon wishes to aid in the destruction of the world. He acts like a child lashing out at parents who have disappointed him. He is no different from you.”</p><p>Albert dismissed the statement with a wave of his hand.</p><p>“That is ridiculous.”</p><p>But even as he said so, he didn’t believe it.</p><p>So he banished the spirit.</p><p>As the flames faded, he contemplated his ancestor’s words.</p><p>A knock came at the door.</p><p>“Enter.”</p><p>Ronnie stuck his head into the office.</p><p>“Hey, boss. We got the money in from Lady Shiva’s. You said you wanted me to tell you.”</p><p>“Good, Ronnie.” He paused and continued. “Please, come in.”</p><p>“Ah, sure, okay.” Ronnie entered the office and stood waiting.</p><p>“What’s up?”</p><p>Albert allowed himself a small smile.</p><p>“Nothing, Ronnie. I just wanted to see you for a moment. You may go.”</p><p>The underling tossed him a strange look.</p><p>“You feelin’ okay, boss?”</p><p>“I’m fine, Ronnie. Go.”</p><p>“Okay.” Ronnie shrugged, turned, and left the office.</p><p>Which told Albert all he needed to know.</p><p>He stared at the walls, recalling coming in here when it was Tommy Shin’s sanctum. Tommy had painted the walls black in order to intimidate people, though he had also decorated it with contemporary movie posters, which somewhat diluted the effect. Albert had taken them down and left the black walls bare.</p><p>To his annoyance, he could no longer recall what movie posters had been there.</p><p>Leaning back in his chair, he tried to remember, but found that he couldn’t.</p><p>That irritated him for some reason.</p><p>Another knock.</p><p>“Uh, boss? I’m back from dinner.” It was Zhong, who had sounded subdued ever since the demon possessed him. “I’m sorry, but there’s some restaurant business we need to go over.”</p><p>“Of course, Zhong. Come in.”</p><p>The man nodded, and he entered the office.</p><p>“There is an issue with—“</p><p>Albert held up a hand.</p><p>“I don’t care. I honestly don’t have time for this. I simply wished you to come into the room. You may leave now.”</p><p>“I’m sorry?” Zhong hesitated, standing close to the desk. “Boss, this is important. We need to—“</p><p>“I do not care,” Albert said in a low whisper. “None of it matters anymore. You will leave my office now.”</p><p>“I—“ Zhong shook his head, then looked up.</p><p>His eyes were black.</p><p>Albert smiled.</p><p>“At last. I was wondering when you would return, demon.”</p><p>“Nice touch.” Zhong’s darkened eyes gazed at the ceiling. “Straight out of the Key of Solomon.” Albert followed that gaze to the Devil’s Trap that Oscar Randolph had etched there in chalk. The circle was large enough that anyone standing next to the desk had to pass beneath it. And as long as the seal remained intact, the demon would be unable to leave its boundaries.</p><p>“I have more,” Albert said. He pressed the intercom button on his phone. “You may come in now.”</p><p>Seconds later, Oscar entered, holding a notebook in his hand. He was wearing his customary flannel shirt, and a cowboy hat to cover his bald head.</p><p>“Aw, you brought Walter Brennan along,” the demon said with Zhong’s voice. “How cute. This isn’t gonna do you any good, y’know. I want the Heart of the Dragon, I want the sword, and your little chalk drawing isn’t going to stop me.”</p><p>“You think so?” Albert asked lightly.</p><p>“I know so,” the demon replied darkly.</p><p>Oscar began to read from his notebook.</p><p>“Regna terrae, cantate Deo, psallite Domino qui fertis super caelum caeli ad Orientem Ecce dabit voci Suae vocem virtutis, tribuite virtutem Deo.”</p><p>“Your pronunciation sucks,” the demon said.</p><p>Albert frowned. From what Oscar had told him, the demon should’ve already been writhing around in agony.</p><p>“Exorcizamus te, omnis immundus spiritus omnis satanica potestas, omnis incursio infernalis adversarii, omnis legio, omnis congregatio et secta diabolica. Ergo draco maledicte et omnis—“</p><p>Zhong made as if his hands were talking puppets.</p><p>“Blah blah blah blah. You’re wasting your time. See, Zhong didn’t spend his dinner hour on dinner.”</p><p>“—legio diabolica adjuramus te cessa decipere humanas creaturas, eisque aeternae Perditionis venenum propinare.”</p><p>Yanking open his button-down shirt, the demon revealed a recently applied tattoo on Zhong’s clavicle.</p><p>“What the hell is that?” Albert demanded, glaring at the chanting hunter.</p><p>But Oscar did not stop.</p><p>“Vade, Satana, inventor et magister omnis fallaciae, hostis humanae salutis. Humiliare sub potenti manu dei, contremisce et effuge, invocato a nobis sancto et terribili nomine, quem inferi tremunt.”</p><p>“It’s a binding,” the demon said, ignoring Oscar’s increasingly desperate incantation. “Zhong doesn’t get rid of me until I say so. Redneck McGee here can cantate to Deo all he wants, but it ain’t gonna do any good.”</p><p>He snarled at Oscar, yet the man stubbornly persisted, moving closer to the figure, practically spitting the Latin words.</p><p>“Ab insidiis diaboli, libera nos, Domine. Ut Ecclesiam tuam secura tibi facias libertate servire, te rogamus, audi nos. Ut inimicos sanctae Ecclesiae humiliare digneris, te rogamus, audi nos.”</p><p>The demon spoke over him.</p><p>“Something else about a Devil’s Trap? All it does is keep me inside its confines. It doesn’t actually stop me from doing much of anything.”</p><p>“That’s not what I was told,” Albert said. “I suspect you are lying, demon.”</p><p>“No, you were just given old information. See, times have changed. The gate is open.”</p><p>At this point, Oscar was practically on top of Zhong.</p><p>“Ut inimicos sanctae Ecclesiae te rogamus, audi nos. Terribilis Deus de sanctuario suo. Deus Israhel ipse truderit virtutem et fortitudinem plebi Suae. Benedictus Deus. Gloria Patri.”</p><p>He practically shouted the last words of the exorcism, but it had done no good whatsoever.</p><p>“Aaaaaaand nothin’,” Zhong said with a laugh. “Glory hallelujiah and aaaaaamen! And you know what else?”</p><p>Zhong snapped his fingers. An awful crack echoed throughout the office even as Oscar’s head turned to an impossible angle and the old man fell to the ground.</p><p>“You walked inside the circle, dumbass,” the demon said, answering its own question.</p><p>It turned to regard Albert, its expression full of contempt. Albert looked back at it steadily, while at the same time he began to chant the spell that would summon the Heart of the Dragon. He had spoken the words so many times now, he could do it without thinking.</p><p>A moment later, his ancestor’s spirit appeared.</p><p>“Now you die,” Albert said calmly, holding the demon’s gaze.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon raised his flaming katana and moved into the Devil’s Trap.</p><p>Yet the demon still seemed utterly unperturbed.</p><p>“You made another mistake, there, Al ol’ pal,” he said conversationally.</p><p>“Did I now?” Albert countered.</p><p>Zhong nodded.</p><p>“See, your office is a bit too small. The outer border of the trap doesn’t extend to your chair, so you’re safe—but it does cover your desk. Which means I can get at what’s in it.”</p><p>With a gesture, the demon consumed the desk in an eldritch fire that burned brighter and hotter even than the flames that wreathed the Heart of the Dragon.</p><p>Albert leapt back from the inferno, feeling his heart sink as he realized the demon’s plan.</p><p>Everything the desk had contained was destroyed, with one exception—the hook sword. It lay revealed, and then at a gesture flew into Zhong’s hands.</p><p>Turning, the demon stared at the Heart of the Dragon and laughed.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this moment for a very long time,” he said. “Y’see, it’s true—all things do come to the guy who waits. And with the help of my old buddy Doragon Kokoro, I’m gonna be the one who wins the day.”</p><p>“Boy, are you a dumbass.”</p><p>Jerking with surprise, Albert looked up. Standing in the doorway were two young men. He didn’t recognize them, but they matched Tiny’s descriptions of the Winchester brothers.</p><p>It was the shorter of the two who had spoken, and he continued.</p><p>“You actually let yourself get stuck in a Devil’s Trap. That makes you stupider than a box’a hammers.”</p><p>“You watch your mouth, boy,” the demon said. “Or just step forward a bit—either works for me.”</p><p>“He can’t,” the taller one said, “but I can.” And he stepped into the room. “I’m Lucifer’s vessel. You do any harm to me, if you even can, and it just might piss off your demon buddies.”</p><p>Albert watched as the creature stared at the Winchesters, then at the Heart of the Dragon. The ancient warrior swung his fiery katana, but the demon blocked it with the hook sword. The samurai attacked again.</p><p>“If you two garbanzos had a play,” the demon said, Zhong’s voice now straining with the effort of fighting off Albert’s ancestor, “you’d have made it by now, instead of babbling like idiots.”</p><p>“Nah,” the shorter one said, “y’see we’re just stalling. Fact is, I do have a plan, and it includes a buddy of ours doing something at just the right moment. In fact, right about—“ Suddenly, Albert felt as if his stomach was being sucked out through his nose. Pain slammed into his head, and he lost all feeling in his legs.</p><p>The feeling passed almost instantaneously, but when it did, he was no longer in his office—he was standing in the alley next to the restaurant, between one of the dumpsters and a black vintage car of a type he hadn’t seen in decades.</p><p>“What the—?”</p><p>“Hello,” said a deep, scratchy voice. Whirling around, Albert saw a white man with stubble on his cheeks. He was wearing a trench coat and giving Albert the most intense stare he’d ever seen—and this after taking meetings with the Old Man.</p><p>“What have you—?” he began.</p><p>“My name is Castiel,” the figure responded, interrupting him as if he was utterly insignificant. “You will remain here, and not interfere in what Dean and Sam are doing.”</p><p>Unwilling to listen to this person, Albert started to walk across Ellis—</p><p>—only to find that he couldn’t move.</p><p>Castiel’s tone never changed as he spoke.</p><p>“As I said, you will remain here. Trying to do otherwise will only cause you difficulty.”</p><p>Albert seethed.</p><p>And then, all of a sudden, it came to him.</p><p>Batman and Lethal Weapon 2. Those were the posters Tommy had in his office.</p><p>He wondered why he remembered that now.…</p><p>The first thing Sam Winchester did after Albert Chao disappeared was grab the demon-killing knife.</p><p>Leaping into the Devil’s Trap, he thrust the knife at the man who was possessed by the demon.</p><p>The man parried the strike with the hook sword, and the impact sent painful vibrations up Sam’s arm.</p><p>He had to be the one to use the knife—his status as Lucifer’s intended vessel meant the demons couldn’t harm him. This one, however, didn’t seem to have gotten the memo. Or didn’t care, because he swung the sword right at Sam’s head.</p><p>Sam ducked and thrust upward with the knife, but the demon jerked back, tucking in his stomach so that Sam only stabbed air.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon then swung his katana, flames trailing behind it, but the demon was able to parry that as well.</p><p>It backed to the edge of the Devil’s Trap, looking back and forth from Sam to the samurai, holding the sword heart ready.</p><p>“Neither of you is gonna bring me down,” the creature snarled. “It’s taken a century and a half for this to come together, and you’re not taking it away from me.”</p><p>Simultaneously, both Sam and the spirit of Yoshio Nakadai attacked.</p><p>The demon parried both strikes, using the base of the sword to block the katana while catching Ruby’s knife in the curved hook at the tip.</p><p>Then a shot rang out.</p><p>The bullet slammed into the shoulder of the body the demon had possessed. He hardly even jerked, and glanced over at Dean.</p><p>“What the hell do you think you’re—“</p><p>The distraction, however, was all Sam needed to slide the blade between two ribs.</p><p>Frozen in place, the demon glowed with a light that seemed to come from inside his body, even as he screamed and fell to the floor, dropping the hook sword.</p><p>Sam scooped it up, looked straight at the Heart of the Dragon, focused on him, and filled his mind with thoughts only of the fiery spirit. As he did so, he recited the same spell that his father had uttered twenty years earlier.</p><p>Doragon Kokoro stared at him in anticipation.</p><p>When Sam got to the final part of the spell, he raised the blade over his head and swung downward. The curved hook penetrated the chest of the spirit where his heart once beat.</p><p>The flames around the spirit burned so bright that Sam had to shield his eyes. It was a pure white flame—a thing of beauty.</p><p>As the spirit faded from view, Sam heard one word echo through the office.</p><p>“Arigato.”</p><p>Then the office was empty, save for the two brothers, and the dead body on the floor.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean.</p><p>“I think we did it.”</p><p>“Looks like,” Dean said with a nod. Peering around, he shrugged in the direction of the door. “C’mon, let’s blow this pop stand.”</p><p>They went out the back way—the same way they’d come in, just like John Winchester had done twenty years ago— emerging into the alley where Castiel was waiting for them, standing on the other side of the Impala. Oddly, the angel appeared to be alone.</p><p>“Where’s Chao?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We must go,” Castiel said.</p><p>Dean approached the driver’s door, which was on the street side.</p><p>“Yeah, but what happened to—?”</p><p>“Uh, Dean?”</p><p>Sam had run around to the other side to get into the passenger seat. Seeing his brother’s face, Dean walked round the car to join him.</p><p>What was left of Albert Chao was pretty messy. There were gaping, bloody wounds all over his body, from his head all the way down to his feet.</p><p>Castiel spoke again.</p><p>“We must go. The authorities will be here soon.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Dean agreed and both boys got into the car.</p><p>A moment later Castiel appeared in the back seat behind them. Sam still hadn’t got used to that.</p><p>Dean started the engine and backed out of the alley and into Ellis Street’s traffic.</p><p>“What the hell happened to him?” he asked the angel.</p><p>“The Heart of the Dragon kept Albert Chao alive, and protected him from all harm. When you cast the spell that sent the spirit away—“</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“He wasn’t protected anymore, and it all caught up. God, that must’ve been, like, every wound he ever got all hitting him at once.”</p><p>Castiel responded without emotion.</p><p>“He did scream rather loudly, which is why I believed it was important to remove ourselves from the scene. I could have simply telepor—“</p><p>“No!” Dean bellowed. “Just—no.”</p><p>Sam smiled, an action that still hurt his bruised face. He didn’t see what the big deal was, but he was pretty sure it was mainly because Dean hated any mode of travel that wasn’t the Impala.</p><p>“You did well,” Castiel said, although his face betrayed almost no hint of emotion. “Had the demon been able to control the Heart of the Dragon, it would have been catastrophic.”</p><p>Sam turned around to question Castiel further, but the angel was gone. He looked at Dean, but his brother just shrugged.</p><p>They had solved a problem that had plagued their parents and their grandparents, and kept a dangerous spirit out of the hands of the bad guys in the angel-demon war. Sam wasn’t convinced there were any good guys in that conflict, but he also knew that he didn’t want the demons to win.</p><p>The Heart of the Dragon was an advantage he didn’t want them to have.</p><p>Dean drove them back to the Emperor Norton Lodge, where they packed their bags and went to the lobby to check out.</p><p>Dean put the two key cards on the registration desk.</p><p>“Checking out of 102,” he said to the clerk.</p><p>“Sure.” The clerk typed at the computer, then quoted Dean a price.</p><p>Dean handed over the amount in cash, taken from his poker winnings, plus a bit extra.</p><p>The clerk dutifully counted the money. Sam noticed that it took him a couple of tries.</p><p>Guess nobody pays in cash anymore.</p><p>“Uh, sir? This is twenty-five dollars over.”</p><p>“I know,” Dean said. “I called the city ‘’Frisco’ a couple of times. That’s my fine for the emperor.”</p><p>The clerk frowned.</p><p>“Emperor?”</p><p>“You don’t know about Emperor Norton?” Dean sounded incredulous. “Dude, don’t you work here?”</p><p>“Oh, that guy,” the clerk said, shaking his head. “Yeah, well, I haven’t... he wasn’t.…”</p><p>Dean rolled his eyes, then turned and headed out, Sam right behind him.</p><p>“Kids today,” Dean grumbled, “no sense of history.”</p><p>Even though it hurt, Sam chuckled.</p><h2><span id="epilogue">EPILOGUE</span><a href="#epilogue" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Zachariah loved the view of New York City.</p><p>Every once in a while, when he actually had some down time—which didn’t happen that often, especially lately— he’d go somewhere that reminded him of the good humans could accomplish if they put their minds to it.</p><p>New York wasn’t Zachariah’s favorite city, but it was probably the one he enjoyed most of those that were left.</p><p>Of course, nothing could beat Edo in its heyday.</p><p>Or Rome.</p><p>Or Constantinople.…</p><p>Zachariah sighed. He missed the good old days.</p><p>Still, New York had its charms. It certainly was the perfect intersection of all the things humanity did right: art, architecture, culture.</p><p>It exemplified a lot of what they did wrong, too. Especially now—but just at the moment Zachariah couldn’t fault them for it.</p><p>After all, if you can’t go crazy during the Apocalypse, then when can you go crazy?</p><p>He was sitting at the Top of the Rock, sipping an espresso. The restaurant was on the top floor of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in the symbolic—if not geographic— center of Manhattan, in the heart of New York City. It perfectly symbolized what was best and what was worst about those silly little creatures with their free will and their craziness that Zachariah’s father adored so very much.</p><p>It was as if he was on top of the world.</p><p>From up here, on this cool, crisp, cloudless December morning, Zachariah could see the entire lower half of Manhattan, and past it to New York Harbor, Brooklyn, Queens, the Statue of Liberty, Staten Island, New Jersey, and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The spires of the city reached for the sky at varying heights, creating a lovely pattern.</p><p>He couldn’t really see the people, and there was no air traffic either, so nothing cluttered the perfection of the buildings.</p><p>But that led rather perfectly to the bad. Still there was a gaping hole at the southern end of the island, where two of the city’s proudest structures once stood. And the event that destroyed them was why there was less air traffic over Manhattan. For that matter, Top of the Rock had opened up because the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001 cost the city its Windows on the World.</p><p>It was just another example of how mankind had squandered what it possessed. The angels had had enough.</p><p>Humanity had pissed away the gifts God gave them, and the host wasn’t going to hold their hands anymore.</p><p>Zachariah had hoped the war would progress more smoothly. He hadn’t counted on so many betrayals by his brothers—Uriel, Castiel—nor that the Michael sword would be such a pain in the ass.</p><p>Just as his espresso cup landed in the saucer with a click, Uzziel was there across from him. None of the humans in the restaurant noticed—and even if they had, their recollections would have been that the large black man had always been sitting across from the broad-shouldered, bald white man.</p><p>“How’d it go?” Zachariah asked.</p><p>“Well enough,” Uzziel said. “I destroyed the angelus iuguolo, and the final Stone of Hyginus is with the others in Cordoba. We lost Ramiel, though.”</p><p>“Pity. And the rest of the operation?”</p><p>Uzziel smiled.</p><p>“The Heart of the Dragon has been banished, as you predicted.”</p><p>“Of course.” Zachariah nodded as he lifted his cup again. “I knew if word leaked to Castiel of the spirit’s return—and of the demons’ interest—that he’d let the two jackasses know about it.” He drank down the last of his espresso. “The Winchesters may refuse to play their parts as they should, but the least they can do is help us out in other ways.”</p><p>Uzziel’s response echoed his frustration.</p><p>“Isn’t there some other way?” he asked. “Can’t we just kill them and move on?”</p><p>Closing his eyes and leaning back, Zachariah sighed.</p><p>“Oh, how I wish we could. But no, they’re the chosen ones. Nobody else can be Michael’s vessel—or Lucifer’s. Nobody else would be able to handle it.”</p><p>Zachariah opened his eyes again, and stared right at Uzziel.</p><p>“The last thing we need to do is screw up the Apocalypse.”</p><h3><span id="acknowledgments">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><a href="#acknowledgments" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>Thanks first of all to my DC Comics editor, Christopher Cerasi, who liked my other two novels enough to hire me to write a third, and who also provided me with tons of useful reference material (like the fifth-season scripts that told me how to spell Castiel’s nickname). Also to my Titan Books editor Cath Trechman, who kept things moving smoothly— or at least smoothly as her deadbeat writer would allow. Cath, Christopher and Supernatural’s Rebecca Dessertine had tons of brilliant suggestions that made this book so much better, and I am excessively grateful to them all.</p><p>Eric Kripke and his merry band of loonies (in particular Sera Gamble and Ben Edlund) for giving us Supernatural in the first place and continuing to write such nifty stories involving Sam, Dean, and the rest.</p><p>Jensen Ackles (Dean Winchester), Jim Beaver (Bobby Singer), Ridge Canipe (Young Dean), Misha Collins (Castiel), Alex Ferris and Colin Ford (Young Sam), Kurt Fuller (Zachariah), Amy Gumenick (Mary Campbell), Allison Hossack (Deanna Campbell), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (John Winchester), Jared Padalecki (Sam Winchester), and Mitch Pileggi (Samuel Campbell) for their onscreen portrayals that gave voice, face, and life to several of the characters appearing in this novel.</p><p>My ever-excellent gaggle of beta readers: Constance Cochran, Kara Cox, GraceAnne Andreassi DeCandido, Heidi Ellis, Marina Frants, Natalie Jumper, and Nicholas Knight.</p><p>Speaking of Mr. Knight, his many volumes of Supernatural: The Official Companion were immensely helpful reference sources.

From AC/DC’s “Back in Black” playing over the Impala driving down the highway to the brilliant use of such songs as Styx’s “Renegade” and Kansas’s “Carry on, Wayward Son” to Sam and Dean singing a dreadfully off-key version of Bon Jovi’s “Wanted Dead or Alive,” music has been an integral part of Supernatural’s very soul.</p><p>Those two playlists still apply to Heart of the Dragon, but as with Bone Key, I’ve made some additions:</p><p>America: “A Horse with No Name”</p><p>The Band: “Across the Great Divide,” “Tears of Rage,” “We Can Talk”</p><p>The Beatles: “A Hard Day’s Night,” “Come Together,” “I Want You (She’s So Heavy)”</p><p>David Bromberg: “Suffer to Sing the Blues”</p><p>The Contours: “Do You Love Me (Now That I Can Dance)”</p><p>Creedence Clearwater Revival: “Fortunate Son.”</p><p>Crosby, Stills, &amp; Nash: “Suite: Judy Blue Eyes”</p><p>The Charlie Daniels Band: “Still in Saigon”</p><p>The Doobie Brothers: “Black Water,” “China Grove”</p><p>Bob Dylan: “Ballad of a Thin Man,” “Blowin’ in the Wind,” “Tangled Up in Blue”</p><p>Norman Greenbaum: “Spirit in the Sky”</p><p>Arlo Guthrie: “Chilling of the Evening,” “Coming Into Los Angeles,” “The Motorcycle Song”</p><p>Jimi Hendrix: “Purple Haze,” “The Star-Spangled Banner”</p><p>Iron Butterfly: “In-A-Gada-Da-Vida”</p><p>Jethro Tull: “A New Day Yesterday,” “Nothing is Easy,” “Teacher”</p><p>Janis Joplin: “Me and Bobby McGee”</p><p>Taj Mahal: “Keep Your Hands Off Her,” “Stagger Lee”</p><p>Van Morrison: “Caravan,” “Moondance”</p><p>Kenny Rogers &amp; The First Edition: “Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)”</p><p>The Rolling Stones: “(I Can’t Get No) Satisfaction”</p><p>Sam &amp; Dave: “Hold On, I’m Coming”</p><p>Simon &amp; Garfunkel: “I am a Rock,” “Mrs. Robinson,” “The Sound of Silence”</p><p>Cat Stevens: “Moonshadow,” “Peace Train,” “Wild World”</p><p>The Subdudes: “Papa Dukie and the Mud People”</p><p>Paul Thorn: “Angel Too Soon,” “Mission Temple Fireworks Stand”</p><p>Traffic: “Many a Mile to Freedom”</p><p>The Ventures: “Wipe Out”</p><p>The Who: “Love Ain’t for Keeping,” “Won’t Get Fooled Again”</p><p>The Zombies: “Time of the Season”</p><p>—Keith R.A. DeCandido somewhere in New York City, November 2009</p><h3><span id="about-the-author">ABOUT THE AUTHOR</span><a href="#about-the-author" class="header-anchor">#</a></h3><p>This is Keith R.A. DeCandido’s third Supernatural novel, following 2007’s Nevermore and 2008’s Bone Key. Keith has written more than forty novels, as well as a mess of short stories, a smattering of novellas, a bunch of comic books, a dollop of essays, a gaggle of eBooks, and many bits of editing. Most are in various media universes: Farscape (most recently the monthly comic from BOOM!

It was almost silent, drifting up the long driveway to the camp with no engine noise, the only sound the crunch of gravel under its tires. The gunmetal-gray frame came to a halt in the grass field adjacent to the camp that was too-generously labeled “Parking Lot.”</p><p>Caleb stared as the driver’s door opened and a tall man got out. The stranger’s appearance was immaculate—every hair perfectly in place—but something was off. Caleb figured it was probably the Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>“Where is Justin Black?” the man intoned, without preamble.</p><p>Despite Caleb’s considerable strengths as a camp counselor, actually keeping track of the children was a remarkably low priority for him. We’re in the middle of the woods, he told himself, where are they gonna go? For that reason, the Hawaiian-shirted man had caught him off guard.</p><p>“Uh... at camp?” Caleb said, and regretted the words as soon as they spilled from his mouth. Is Justin Black the fat one with the Harry Potter birthmark, he pondered, or the creepy little one who was always trying to give out free hugs?</p><p>“My son. His location.” The man paused for effect. “I require more specific information.”</p><p>Caleb glanced into the open window of the activities building, hoping that he’d happen to see the boy in there.</p><p>Nope.</p><p>“I’ll find him. He’s out by the lake, I think,” Caleb said, putting on his best reassuring voice. He’d better be, he thought, or this is going to be awkward.</p><p>“No,” the man said. “I’ll find him myself.”</p><p>The man walked purposefully toward the forest path, and Caleb quickly followed. There was something off-putting about the guy, and Caleb didn’t recognize him from parents’ night. Could have been the weed, though, he thought. Actually, wasn’t it Justin Black’s dad who’d brought the weed?</p><p>Caleb hurried to catch up to the man’s long strides.</p><p>“Is there a problem?” he asked. “Usually Justin’s mom picks him up—“</p><p>“No problem.” The man cut him off. “I just need to speak with the boy.”</p><p>Yup, he’s a pervert. Who else calls their son “the boy?” Caleb sped up his pursuit.</p><p>“What was your name again?” Caleb asked, hoping it would jog some memory of this guy. “I didn’t catch it before.”</p><p>The man turned, slow and deliberate.</p><p>“Don. Call me Don.”</p><p>The camp counselor was certainly annoying, but it was by no means the worst thing Don had had to put up with in his long and storied existence. His former profession had brought him into contact with the absolute worst of the worst, the darkest blights on the fabric of humankind that ever walked the Earth. I’m like Jerry Springer without the fame, Don thought, amused by his own analogy. After his previous occupation, it didn’t take much to amuse Don. Well, the fame part is about to change.</p><p>Losing the counselor in the forest was a simple matter. One moment, the kid was an arm’s-length away. The next, Don was a quarter-mile ahead of him. The path wound its way down a hill, dense thickets of forest obscuring the view. It would all be over before the counselor caught up.</p><p>The lake itself was pristine and beautiful, its glassy surface rippling with the slight breeze. An amazing summer day, one like Don hadn’t seen in... too long to remember.</p><p>“Ew! Don’t touch it with your bare hands!”</p><p>Don’s head turned an unnatural degree to find the source of the shout. It had come from a girl, about ten years old, running away from a boy of the same age.</p><p>Justin Black.</p><p>“You’re gonna get warts!” the girl cried, desperately dodging away from the frog in Justin’s outstretched hands.</p><p>“No I won’t,” Justin said, “my brother said frogs give you herpes.”</p><p>“What’s that?” the girl asked innocently.</p><p>“I dunno. Why don’t you ask the frog?” Justin thrust the amphibian at her, only to have it leap out of his hands and into the bog at the lake’s edge.</p><p>“Great, now you made me lose it,” Justin complained.</p><p>He reached down into the bog to find the lost creature, but another pair of hands got there first. Don lifted the frog out of the swampy water, holding it delicately, as if the slightest pressure would shatter it.</p><p>“It’s not lost, my boy,” Don said, a warm look on his face.</p><p>Justin took a step back, confused.</p><p>“Dad?”</p><p>“No, Justin, not exactly.”</p><p>The frog croaked loudly, startling both of the children. Justin’s brow furrowed.</p><p>“Mom said you’re not supposed to come see me. She said the police wouldn’t let you.”</p><p>“My boy, that was the old me. There’s a new set of rules, now.” Don held out the frog to Justin, trying to bring the boy closer.</p><p>“You like frogs, don’t you?”</p><p>Caleb’s mind was racing. Where had the man gone? Should he call the cops? How the hell had he got so far ahead? He began to run, hurtling down the path as he started to panic, stumbling over the uneven ground. Then he felt his foot hit a rock, sending him tumbling down the slope and slamming into a tree.</p><p>“Damn it!” he groaned, as the pain shot through him, bringing tears to his eyes. Wincing, he shifted into a sitting position and peered at his leg. His pants were ripped and a trail of blood was seeping down his thigh.</p><p>Crap.</p><p>He pulled himself up, took a step forward, and collapsed. Oh God, I can’t stand. Maybe it’s broken.</p><p>Fear filled his mind. Fear of what would happen to the kids at the lake, fear of what would happen when his boss found out about his inattentiveness, and fear of dying slowly of bloodloss out in the woods where no one could find him.</p><p>Calm the hell down, he thought, this isn’t even that bad. It’s barely even bleeding. That realization helped him get back to his feet. He had managed to hobble a few steps forward when he heard it.</p><p>The blood-curdling scream of Justin Black.</p><h2><span id="chapter-1">CHAPTER 1</span><a href="#chapter-1" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>I can feel it, Dean thought. The sky is falling. It wasn’t a new feeling. In fact, the sky had been falling on Dean Winchester since he was four years old. The difference, of course, was that this time could very well be the last time. And this is where it all ends? The Apocalypse is gonna go down in the ass-edge of nowhere?</p><p>Dean let out a tired sigh as he gunned the Impala onto County Road 6. There was nothing on either side of the asphalt except cornfields, cattle, farms and farmers—the very Americana that Dean and his brother Sam fought to protect. For a moment, Dean’s imagination took hold, and the clouds on the horizon became pillars of smoke, spilling from unseen tongues of flame. The rotting wooden beams of a decrepit barn became the last remnants of humanity. Dean shook the vision out of his head, and the clouds were once again clouds. The barn was, once more, just a barn.</p><p>For months, Dean and Sam had been on the suicide mission to end all suicide missions—to hunt down and kill the Devil. Though the weight of the task seemed unbearable, the brothers knew that they were the only ones who could shoulder it. It was, after all, their fault that right now Lucifer walked the earth.</p><p>No. Sam’s fault.</p><p>Dean shoved the thought to the dark recesses of his mind. It wouldn’t do him any good to dwell on it. His younger brother—the boy who Dean had practically raised since their mother died—had broken the Final Seal. In a moment of weakness, Sam had killed the demon Lilith, unintentionally popping the lock on Satan’s cage. Now, after nearly a year of chasing him, they were no closer to shoving the bastard back into the lock-up.</p><p>But that wasn’t even the bad news. The angels, ostensibly protectors of humanity, had in fact been behind Satan’s jailbreak.</p><p>“They wanted you to break the Seal,” Dean had explained to his brother in the moments after Lucifer’s rise. “They’re sick of waiting around in Heaven. With Satan out, they get to bring on the prizefight. Winner takes Earth.”</p><p>The angels already had a plan in motion—according to the winged bastards, the only way to defeat Lucifer was for Dean to be the host for the archangel Michael, the most powerful weapon in Heaven’s arsenal. They even had an overdramatic pet name for Dean: the Michael Sword. Every fiber of Dean’s body rebelled against the idea. The battle between Michael and Lucifer would have the minor side effect of destroying half the Earth. A “planetary enema,” Zachariah had called it. The douche.</p><p>Lucifer’s final vessel was to be Sam. The symmetry must be funny to someone upstairs, Dean thought. Michael and Lucifer were brothers, one of them following closely in their father’s footsteps, the other... Well, just like Sam, Lucifer had always wanted to go his own way.</p><p>However, the one thing neither Heaven nor Hell could control was human will. While on Earth, angels—both righteous and fallen—had to take a willing human host. If Sam and Dean didn’t say “yes” to Lucifer and Michael, the battle couldn’t happen. The archangels would have to putter around in their alternate, non-ordained meatsuits, tearing their lesser vessels apart while they waited for Sam and Dean to come around to the party line.</p><p>The Winchester brothers weren’t going to fight each other. There had to be another way.</p><p>But every time they thought they had Lucifer within their sights, fate slapped their faces again. They had tried their old standby: straight-up violence, attempting to kill Lucifer outright. First with the Colt, a gun so powerful it was said to be able to kill anything, but that had barely given their Adversary a headache. They had Ruby’s demon-killing knife, but that was just as impotent against an archangel. The only chance they had left was to catch Lucifer by surprise. No small feat.</p><p>“Take a right at Camp Dakota Road,” Sam directed.</p><p>“Really? Couldn’t have figured that one out, Sam,” Dean shot back. “Since we’re going to a camp.”</p><p>Sam had been getting under his skin recently. Actually, everything had been getting under his skin. The endless hours on the road had proven useless thus far, and Dean was beginning to doubt that they would be able to win this war.</p><p>Can’t fight something you can’t find, he thought. But he also had doubts about his role in the battle to come. Even if I’m doing everything in my power to find another way... can someone change the role they’re destined by fate to play? Avoiding destiny is what Dean and Sam had been doing so far. But how much longer can we keep that up? They were flying under the angels’ radar, and for now, that was enough.</p><p>It had to be.</p><p>A week ago Sam had started tracking the local news from a small town in South Dakota. It had been lighting up with apocalyptic signs like an end-of-the-world Christmas tree.</p><p>Maybe we’re finally getting a freakin’ break, Dean thought hopefully.</p><p>Their first stop was a kids’ day camp. A gas station attendant a couple of towns over had told them about it. The scruffy dude had said he didn’t rightly know what had happened, but his cousin’s girlfriend’s mom had told him that it was like something out of the Bible and children had been harmed. That alone was enough to warrant a visit.</p><p>Dean pushed the accelerator to the Impala’s firewall, his hazel eyes glinting with anger. Every second they were delayed, Lucifer got another step ahead of them.</p><p>Sam threw a sideways glance at Dean. Thanks to all the years they had spent on the road, Sam could read his older brother’s mood just by the way he tightened his grip on the steering wheel or blew his breath out through his nose in short staccato bursts.</p><p>Dean’s pissed about something again, Sam thought. And probably for no good reason. Sam felt the constant burden of his brother’s anger and expectations. Chief among them was the expectation that they’d do things Dean’s way—or, more accurately, John Winchester’s way. The pressure to fit into their father’s shoes had always been immense—doubly so since his death—and Dean was the poster child for Daddy’s boys. He dressed like John Winchester, drove his car, listened to his music. He even walked like John. Sam, on the other hand, had tried time and time again to get free of his father and everything that he represented. Now, Sam realized that Dean felt like his brother had strayed too far off the path, at times even irretrievably. He had dealt with demons, using the power that their blood gave him... all things that John would never have allowed. Despite all of that, Sam was fine. He knew that, he just wished that Dean would realize it too. For the most part, Dean seemed to trust him, but that didn’t mean they would always get along.</p><p>The final battle is looming, and we’re stuck smack dab in the middle of it. Sam pursed his lips together—he felt like they were coming to the end of something. He just didn’t know what.</p><p>Preoccupied, Sam glanced out the passenger window just as the Impala careened by the split log sign for CAMP WITKI NIKI.</p><p>“There!” he shouted, a little too loudly, pointing at the sign.</p><p>“G-and-an-H crap!” Dean yelled, as he turned the wheel quickly to the left, fishtailing the Impala’s tires, a spray of gravel hitting the trees on both sides of the deeply rutted driveway. “Inside voice, inside voice!” Dean spat. He opened his mouth to say more, then clearly decided to drop it.</p><p>The Impala bumped its way over the gravel.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said. “So what are we walking into?”</p><p>Relieved his brother’s outburst was over, Sam grabbed his laptop.</p><p>“From what I can find, a bunch of creeped out parents, but no dead kids. Guess our gas station buddy was overstating that part.” Sam pulled up the Grenville, South Dakota Tribune webpage and scanned the article.</p><p>“There’s this posting on a comment board written by some totally hysterical mother named Nancy Johnson. Something huge happened yesterday, but she doesn’t say what, just that a strange man walked into the camp. It scared the bejesus out of all the parents, but there’s nothing in the police report, so technically no crime was committed. This woman writes, ‘Considering the highly sensitive nature of the children at Witki Niki, it is of the utmost importance that each child be under an adult’s care at all times.’”</p><p>Dean brought the Impala to a stop on a grass field. Pulling on the hand-brake he turned to Sam.</p><p>“We’re here because some berserk Betty on a mommy-blog vents that a ‘strange guy’ walked into little Timmy’s day camp? Are you effing kidding me, Sam?” Dean paused for a moment to let his frustration sink in. “What, so if somebody farts in Yankee stadium, we run it down as a demon?”</p><p>Sam sighed. Sometimes he felt as if he could never to do anything right for Dean.</p><p>“There are apocalyptic omens here. The attendant says it was straight out of the Book of Revelation... You don’t think that’s worth looking into?”</p><p>Sam pushed open the car door. Then he heard it.</p><p>“What the hell is that?” Dean growled, emerging from the other side of the Impala.</p><p>A cacophony of what sounded like a thousand dying car horns emanated from behind a grove of trees. Sam and Dean looked at each other, the edginess of the last twenty minutes now dropped.</p><p>Sam sprang into action. Ears stinging from the piercing noise, he ran round to the back of the car, popped open the trunk and lifted up the false bottom to reveal their secret stash of weapons and materials. Dean reached in and backhanded Sam a revolver, taking a sawed-off for himself. He slipped the shotgun down the back of his worn Levi’s with practiced ease.</p><p>Sam palmed a quart bag of salt and slipped it into his breast pocket. Never be caught off guard, he thought, hearing his father’s words as if John was standing two feet away.</p><p>They strode through the grass with deliberation, the strange noise getting louder and louder. As they reached a rocky path that led down a slope, they heard a high-pitched voice call out, “Hey! Stop! I said stop!”</p><p>The Winchesters turned and were accosted by a freckled, red-haired youth, several inches shorter than Dean and several years younger than Sam. He came limping toward them, an elaborate-looking air cast on his left leg.</p><p>He managed to get within a few yards of them before he had to start hopping on his good foot. Dean looked the young man up and down, eying his lime-green cast.</p><p>“Wow, that’s some injury there. You get that playing World of Warcraft, or doing some major texting on lonelygeek dot com?”</p><p>Sam saw the guy’s face immediately sour. Smooth, Dean.</p><p>“I got it on duty,” the young man squeaked out.</p><p>“Really. On duty?” Dean said, smirking. “What do you do, exactly?”</p><p>“I’m head junior counselor. Who the hell are you?”</p><p>But Dean had already lost interest and was making his way down the hill.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it, kid.”</p><p>Sam glanced at his brother’s retreating back, then smiled at the young man. “We’re just checking some stuff out. Were you here yesterday? I’m sorry, what’s your name?”</p><p>The young man looked embarrassed and Sam could see sweat bead on his upper lip, despite the breeze.</p><p>“Caleb. It wasn’t my fault,” he stuttered. “The EPA said it was just a freak explosion—“</p><p>“Explosion?” Sam interrupted.</p><p>“Yeah, freak explosion of the population.”</p><p>“The population of what?”</p><p>His answer didn’t come from Caleb, but from the tree line.</p><p>“FROGS!”</p><p>Sam turned to see Dean holding up a large frog. Dean took one of the amphibian’s front legs between his thumb and forefinger and made it wave at his brother to join him. Sam thanked the kid and headed down the hill to meet Dean.</p><p>“Can you believe this?” Dean said, gesturing toward the sea of frogs that were hopping around the forest floor. “Guess Kermit and Miss Piggy have been busy.”</p><p>Sam walked past him toward the lake.</p><p>“Okay, you got your frog-sex joke in, but now are you going to tell me I was right? I mean, this is about as apocalyptic as it gets.”</p><p>“I guess so.” Dean gently put down the frog and caught up with Sam. “Remind me what the deal is with frogs and the Apocalypse?”</p><p>Sam looked toward the lakeshore, where every kid in the camp was sprinting around with buckets, bags, milk crates— anything that could carry more than one frog. He spotted several makeshift frog-racing sites, as well as kids trying to make frogs play badminton, kids having frog tea parties, a couple of kids trying to have frogs play basketball—there was even one lonely kid that had set up frogs for a mock trial. Deep inside him, Sam again wished his childhood had been more normal. The kids here were having a ball, despite the biblical overtones of the situation.</p><p>Sam turned to his brother.</p><p>“In Exodus, God rained frogs down on the Egyptians as punishment for not letting the Israelites free. ‘And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.’”</p><p>“Okay, so frogs are bad. But these kids are going apeshit over them. Doesn’t look so terrible to me.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. He didn’t have all the answers.</p><p>Caleb tottered down the hillside and caught up to them.</p><p>“Excuse me, I still didn’t get your names,” he said.</p><p>Dean scowled at him.</p><p>“Why don’t you tell us how all these frogs got here.”</p><p>Caleb threw his hands in the air, exasperated.</p><p>“Like I told Mr. Butler! How many times do I have to explain this?”</p><p>“Who’s Mr. Butler?” Sam asked.</p><p>“My boss,” Caleb said with a hearty eye-roll. “Justin Black’s father showed up out of the blue yesterday. I didn’t exactly realize he wasn’t supposed to see his son. Guy was acting kind of strange, and the next thing I know he’s down at the lake with the kids. Then all hell broke loose.”</p><p>Dean surveyed the children running around in near-hysterical, frog-induced mayhem. A few tired-looking counselors were trying—and for the most-part failing—to keep some kind of control.</p><p>“Where is Justin Black?”</p><p>Dean and Sam made their way toward a large rectangular log cabin dining hall. Inside, little Justin Black sat at a long table. He was pudgy, and wore a striped shirt a size too small and cargo shorts five inches too long, Dean could tell that Justin wasn’t the most popular kid at Camp Witki Niki. Dean himself would have made fun of this kid.</p><p>Justin’s face was red and splotchy from crying. A large frog sat in his lap, and his fingers stroked its flat head like it was a golden retriever.</p><p>“Justin?” Sam said gently.</p><p>The boy looked up suspiciously.</p><p>“Justin, hey. I’m Sam, and this is my brother Dean.”</p><p>Dean gritted his teeth. Aliases, Sam, aliases. Guy has such a soft spot for kids.</p><p>“Justin, we know that your dad came to see you yesterday. Was that the first time you’d seen him in a while?” Sam made his way to the bench next to Justin, and the boy nodded his head.</p><p>“Not supposed to see him till he pays my mom all the supports,” he murmured, and then sniffed and wiped his dripping nose with the back of his hand.</p><p>“You mean child support?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah,” Justin said, keeping his eyes on the table.</p><p>Sam scooted toward Justin a little.</p><p>“You know what kind of frog that is?” he asked.</p><p>“It’s a Rana catesbeiana, American Bullfrog,” Justin said with a short snort.</p><p>“Oh, of course,” Sam said, gently touching the frog’s head. “Justin, did your dad seem... normal yesterday?”</p><p>“Umm. What do you mean?” Justin moved the frog away from Sam’s reach.</p><p>“Did you recognize him right away?” Dean probed. He pressed his hands on the table and leaned toward the boy. Sam gave him a warning stare, indicating that he should take it easy.</p><p>“He’s my dad,” the boy responded.</p><p>“No, I know that, but did you notice anything different about him?” Dean persisted.</p><p>“Well. Like maybe...” Justin trailed off as he inspected his frog.</p><p>“Like maybe what?”</p><p>“Maybe he wasn’t like usual... like... mean.” Justin’s large wet eyes met Dean’s.</p><p>“Do you think that was your dad, Justin?” Dean asked, crouching so his head was level with the boy’s.</p><p>“Of course. He brought me my favorite thing.” Justin rearranged himself on the bench.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>Justin looked at Dean like he was a complete idiot.</p><p>“Frogs. What else?”</p><p>Sam and Dean got back into the Impala.</p><p>“Okay, so the kid’s father shows up, hasn’t seen him for a while. Guy used to be a dick, now he’s bringing Justin a butt-load of his favorite apocalyptic omen? What, the store was out of Super Soakers?” Dean pressed his fingers into his forehead, soothing a building headache. “Who is this guy?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Later that day, the Impala rumbled its way through the small town of Waubay, South Dakota. Like so many American factory towns, the place seemed mostly deserted.</p><p>“Keep your eyes open, we may be walking into Hell’s favorite fishing ground,” Dean said as they parked. He tucked the shotgun underneath his worn leather jacket.</p><p>The brothers walked side by side down the empty streets. The facades of the small mom-and-pop stores were mostly run-down. Paint peeled off the clapboard, giving everything a rag-tag look.</p><p>An obnoxiously loud rumble broke the silence, causing Dean and Sam to swivel on their heels, only to see a jacked-up pick-up truck swing around a corner and disappear. No one else was around.</p><p>Then someone screamed. The boys looked at each other.</p><p>“Where did that come from?” Dean exclaimed, sweeping the streets, wide-eyed. They still seemed to be alone.</p><p>They heard another scream. Sam cocked his weapon, aiming at a nearby intersection.</p><p>“This way,” he said.</p><p>The boys took off, their heavy boots pounding the pavement as they turned the corner and heard it again. Sweat ran down their faces as they skidded to a halt in front of—</p><p>The Waubay Community Swimming Pool. The pool was empty and several old women were wandering around in bathing caps and large tent-like bathing suits. Dean looked at Sam, who just shrugged.</p><p>“What just happened here?” Dean called out, one hand shielding his eyes from the bone-chilling display of geriatric flesh.</p><p>Despite his best efforts, Sam was also having trouble dealing with the half-naked old women. He spied a young-looking guy in sweat pants, holding a whistle, and moved toward him.</p><p>“Can you tell us what’s going on?” he asked.</p><p>The guy, whom he assumed must be a swim instructor, squinted at Sam in confusion.</p><p>“I have no idea,” he said helplessly. “I was giving our regular aquatics class, and the pool just started bubbling.”</p><p>“Bubbling like... boiling?” Sam asked.</p><p>Joining them, Dean smirked.</p><p>“You sure one of these lithe young ladies didn’t lay one?” he said.</p><p>The instructor tilted his head sideways at Dean, a look of surprised irritation Sam had seen directed at his brother with some frequency. Without another word, Dean walked away, wisely leaving the interrogation to Sam.</p><p>“Was anyone hurt?” Sam asked, trying to brush past the instructor’s annoyance.</p><p>“No,” the man replied. “No one gets hurt on my watch. It’s just like I said: the pool started bubbling, scared the scream out of everyone here. Who are you guys anyway?”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Inspectors Antilles and Solo, we’re with the NPSS, National Pool Safety Systems. Have you had your filter updated to the latest safety standards?”</p><p>“Of course I have,” the instructor answered, scowling. “What kind of community pool do you think I’m running?”</p><p>Sam took a step back.</p><p>“Fantastic, we’re always happy to see a dedicated guy like yourself take responsibility. Pool safety is...” Sam trailed off. “... important. I guess. Thanks for your time.”</p><p>Sam joined his brother, who was interviewing a large woman with a bellowing voice. Dean nodded at Sam’s approach.</p><p>“Myra, could you tell my partner here what you just told me?” Dean asked.</p><p>Myra pulled her robe tighter around her.</p><p>“We was just doing our morning routine when the water started getting bubbly,” she boomed. “Slowly at first and then more and more, then it got hot. Real hot, but not enough to boil you. The weird thing was, Eunice and me were just saying that the pool was way too cold to be in it.”</p><p>Sam cocked his head. “Wait, you just said you were cold, then the water got warmer by itself?”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Myra said, nodding her bathing cap-clad head.</p><p>Thanking Myra, Sam and Dean walked away and headed back through town to the Impala.</p><p>“There are lots of references to water transformation in the lore,” Sam said. “Turning to blood, floods... and boiling.”</p><p>“So, it’s the frickin’ Apocalypse, the town is lit up with apocalyptic signs, but they’re... jokes?”</p><p>“You think it’s the Trickster?” Sam gulped. “Gabriel, that is.”</p><p>“Not a chance,” Dean said. “Not his M.O. He’s not one to leave survivors, you know?”</p><p>“So what is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Is My Little Pony one of the Four Horsemen?”</p><p>Dean parked in front of a battered motel. The neon sign read ‘Two Pines Motel,’ and sported two fluorescent pine trees blinking alternately, so it looked like they were swinging in a stiff wind.</p><p>“Oh good, there’s a fish cleaning station on the premises,” Dean said sarcastically.</p><p>“We’re in prime walleye country,” Sam noted. Dean hopped out of the car and headed for the motel lobby.</p><p>Two minutes later, Sam was startled by the thump of Dean banging on the hood. A key dangled from a fish-shaped key lug in his outstretched hand.</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>Sam pulled his duffel out of the trunk and followed Dean into a wood-paneled, simply appointed motel room.</p><p>Dean threw himself onto one of the beds.</p><p>“So where do we go from here?” he asked.</p><p>Sam pulled out a chair and sat down, tugging his boots off and kicking them underneath the wooden table.</p><p>“I guess we see if we can find anything on Justin’s father. Only real lead we have.”</p><p>An hour later, the boys were knee-deep in research. Dean was sprawled out on the bed, his laptop on his chest.</p><p>“Don Black’s DMV records are clean, so are his credit cards—meaning he doesn’t have any. Guy is just a poor schlub trying to make a living.”</p><p>With a couple of simple clicks, Sam had hacked into the local county records.</p><p>“Listen to this. From the family court records, Don Black owed $15,000 to his ex-wife in back child support. Yesterday he paid it all off, in cash. How do you explain that? And I took a look at the auto sales in a hundred-mile radius. Seems yesterday he walked into a dealership and bought a Prius, also using cash.”</p><p>Dean swung his legs onto the floor.</p><p>“Huh. Can’t say I can picture a demon driving a hybrid,” he said. “Okay, he’s the World’s Number One Earth-Loving Dad. He’s not Lucifer. Let’s get the hell out of here.”</p><p>“Can we at least talk to Justin’s mom before we leave?” Sam got up, pulled his boots and coat back on and opened the door.</p><p>Dean stayed where he was.</p><p>“He just paid her fifteen large in cash, you really think she’s gonna sell him down the river?” he asked.</p><p>“Best shot we’ve got,” Sam responded.</p><p>Dean looked at his brother hesitantly. “Where is she?”</p><p>“She works at a restaurant down the road.” Sam nodded his head toward the Impala, visible through the open door.</p><p>Dean dragged himself off the bed. He gave the room a scornful look as he walked outside.</p><p>“As long as it gets us out of this motel. Place smells like Ariel took a dump.”</p><p>A shrill bell announced their arrival at the diner. The small smattering of locals turned Sam and Dean’s way, then quickly went back to their lunches. A pretty redhead stood at the pass-through barking orders at an overweight fry cook.</p><p>“Tommy, how many times do I have to tell you, medium rare ain’t a bloody cow on a bun,” she yelled at him.</p><p>“Kathy Black?” Dean queried. “Ex-wife of Don Black?”</p><p>“Who’s asking?” the redhead demanded, her expression stiffening at the mention of Don. Her reaction was enough to confirm her identity.</p><p>“Listen, I don’t know where he is,” she continued, not waiting for a reply, “but if he owes you money I’m not paying it. And I keep a sawed-off under my pillow in case you have any ideas.”</p><p>“We aren’t loan sharks, ma’am,” Sam said. “We just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your husband.”</p><p>“As he said, ex-husband,” Kathy replied pointedly.</p><p>“Right, ex,” Dean said, stepping in. “My partner apologizes. He doesn’t know how to talk to women. Do you know where Don might be?”</p><p>Kathy frowned, the wrinkles becoming more pronounced on her otherwise attractive face. Years spent trying to wheedle information out of people had taught Dean a couple of things. Never ask questions that are going to waste busy people’s time, and never piss off an ex-wife.</p><p>“You cops?”</p><p>Sam shook his head. “No. Not cops.”</p><p>“‘Cause he hates cops.”</p><p>“So do we,” Dean said with a Cheshire-Cat smile. “Do you know if there’s some place he likes to hang out?”</p><p>Kathy’s gaze shifted to one of her tables across the diner.</p><p>“Listen, I gotta get that guy back there more coffee—“</p><p>“Please,” Sam interrupted. “We work at the dealership. My partner forgot to get Don’s signature on his new car’s registration, and our boss is gonna take it out of my ass—“</p><p>Kathy waved at Sam to stop talking.</p><p>“Fine. Whatever. If he’s around, he’s usually at Polly’s Bar, down round the corner, beige building on the right.”</p><p>Sam and Dean thanked her and left.</p><p>A few minutes later they were outside Polly’s Bar, an ugly old establishment squashed between two uglier buildings. Dean pulled open the door and ducked his head as he stepped through the low entrance.</p><p>As his eyes adjusted to the dimly lit room, he made out a narrow dingy-looking interior with a small number of patrons crowded into one corner. A high-pitched, fast-talking voice immediately drew his attention. Dean and Sam crossed to the bar, where a Hawaiian-shirted man was holding court with the townies.</p><p>“So then the priest says, ‘It can’t be my credit card, because I answer to a higher power.’” The townies snorted a laugh. “Okay, next round on me.” The man gestured around the bar wildly. “For everyone!”</p><p>Dean stood watching, Sam beside him, as the guy took in the small collection of half-hearted whoops and claps that followed.</p><p>“I gotta go to the head,” the man said, peeling off toward the back of the dark room. He entered the hallway, and his head was ratcheted against the wall with a thwack. Dean spun him around forcefully, knocking the wind out of the older man, and shoving his forearm under the guy’s chin.</p><p>Not to flatter himself, but Dean fully expected the guy to wet himself with terror—especially since he was on the way to the bathroom—but the man merely laughed.</p><p>“Hey, if it isn’t the Winchester boys!” he cried. “Ease up. Certainly took you guys long enough.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Shut it, pal. We know what you are, and we know just how to kill you.”</p><p>It was a less than accurate assessment, but Dean made sure his words overflowed with confidence. No sense letting on that this particular brand of freak had them stumped. Has to be a freak, Dean thought. Only the freaks recognize us. The pretense was betrayed by Sam’s stifled cough. Dean shot him a look—Shut the hell up. There was a reason Dean did the poker hustling in the family.</p><p>“Well, we sort of know what you are. You’re a douche, you’re causing problems here, and for us violence is usually the best solution.”</p><p>“Listen guys, I’ve been waiting more than a while... in a bar... for you to get here,” Don said with a bit of edge. “I’m not sure a human bladder can take much more pressure. Can this wait till after I hit the pisser?” He shifted his weight awkwardly back and forth between his legs.</p><p>Dean shoved the man roughly into a tattered booth tucked into the furthest gloomy back corner of the bar, far from the prying eyes of the watering hole’s patrons. Don’t need any of them sticking up for this guy if things go pear-shaped.</p><p>“Not likely, Hawaii Five-Oh. We’ve got to sort some things out first.” Dean cast a sideways glance at his brother. “Sam?”</p><p>With a nod, Sam reached into his jacket pocket for the bag of rock salt, but his hand came out empty.</p><p>“Damn left it in the car,” he muttered. Leaving Dean holding Don hostage in the booth, Sam headed back toward the throng of confused folks at the bar, all no doubt wondering what was happening to their free-drinks ticket. He returned with a handful of salt shakers, which he quickly began to twist open.</p><p>Should have brought the rock salt shotguns, Dean thought. Then we wouldn’t have to resort to these cheap tricks. If Don Black was possessed by a demon, he’d be vulnerable to salt, but it’d take more than a sprinkle. Things would have to get messy.</p><p>“If you really were expecting us, you know that we’ve taken down more than our fair share of your kind.” Dean’s bravado was reaching fever pitch. “Truth is, baby bro here doesn’t even need the salt. He uses his kung-fu grip, your ass is smote back to the pit.”</p><p>It was clear that all three of them knew he was bluffing. Anyone with a passing familiarity with the Apocalypse knew about Sam’s demon-blood addiction and where that dark road had led him.</p><p>Don chuckled softly.</p><p>“You think... you think I’m a demon?” With a bemused look, he lifted one of the salt shakers from the table and upended it, spilling its contents into his mouth. After a moment, he nonchalantly spat the salt onto the table. “Bam.”</p><p>Well, since he’s not choking to death on his own boiling entrails, I guess he’s not a demon. Dean considered the situation, but didn’t see any other alternative. Might as well ask the bastard.</p><p>“Fine then. I give. What the hell are you?”</p><p>“Hell? That’s your problem, Dean. Always looking in the wrong direction.” Don reached out and grabbed Dean’s chin, and before he could object, tilted it upward.</p><p>“Whoa, buddy,” Dean snapped, “bad touch!”</p><p>In an instant, Sam was holding the blade of Ruby’s demon-killing knife to Don’s throat.</p><p>“You guys aren’t great listeners. What is a cursed knife gonna do to an angel?”</p><p>Sam and Dean shared a stunned look. If Don was telling the truth, he had a point. Without an angelic blade, they might as well be throwing peanuts at him.</p><p>“An angel?” Sam asked, slowly pulling the knife away from Don’s jugular. “What kind of angel goes around boiling little old ladies and setting off apocalyptic omens?”</p><p>A jackass angel, Dean thought, which doesn’t exactly narrow it down.</p><p>“I really did think you’d be here a week ago,” Don said sheepishly. “I left plenty of harmless clues. I didn’t get to the frogs and the boiling and whatnot until I realized you weren’t catching on. Isn’t one of you supposed to be smart? A doctor or something?” Sam looked away, a little embarrassed.</p><p>“Lawyer, actually. Ain’t that right, Sammy?” Dean said, slapping his brother on the back with a smirk.</p><p>Don seemed to struggle to hold back his laughter.</p><p>“Lucifer’s vessel on Earth is a lawyer? How perfect is that?”</p><p>“I dropped out of law school,” Sam interjected pointedly. “And I’m nobody’s vessel.”</p><p>“That’s the spirit, Sam. Not to mention exactly what I brought you here to talk about,” Don said a little too excitedly.</p><p>“Next time you want to talk, try calling before you hurt any kids,” Sam said.</p><p>“Nobody got hurt. It was a bunch of frogs. And it’s kind of hard to get in touch with you two, what with the mojo carved into your ribs.” Don said, referring to the Enochian Sigil, an ancient and complex pattern that the angel Castiel had burned into Sam and Dean’s ribcages as protection against both sides in the Apocalypse: the angels and the demons. Without it, Michael and Lucifer would be on them faster than Dean on a bacon cheeseburger.</p><p>“Fair enough,” Dean relented. “So what now? You stick the rest of the angels on us, we bolt, and we start this dance all over again tomorrow?” Even as the words came out of his mouth, Dean knew the ‘bolting’ part wouldn’t work. If it came to blows, the odds were in the angel’s favor. They weren’t leaving the bar unless Don wanted them to.</p><p>Don sat up straight.</p><p>“Not at all. This has nothing to do with them, and everything to do with helping you.”</p><p>“Only help we need is keeping off angel radar,” Dean growled.</p><p>Sam’s eyes darted over to meet his. Dean knew that meant only one thing: he was about to cause trouble.</p><p>“You said you wanted to talk about me... about being Lucifer’s vessel.” Sam began, and then paused, as though trying to find the words. “Everyone we’ve talked to, on both sides, acts like it’s inevitable. That the battle is between Dean and me.”</p><p>Don nodded gravely.</p><p>“But there has to be another way,” Sam said. “There always is.”</p><p>“You’re right. Becoming Lucifer’s vessel isn’t the only way to end the war; it’s just the fastest. I can’t guarantee you’ll love the alternatives, but they are out there.”</p><p>“Sam, don’t let this guy get inside your head,” Dean said, worried. “We don’t know for sure who he is, and even if he is an angel... well, their track record ain’t so great.”</p><p>“Look who’s talking,” Don responded. “At least I didn’t bring on the End Times. And Dean, let’s not forget about your part in this little dance.”</p><p>This guy’s just as much of an asshole as the rest of the angels, Dean thought. Despite their common reputation as agents of God’s will, forces of good, and the gold standard for morality, all the angels Dean had met over the last year had been shifty, manipulative dicks. Except Cass, of course. Castiel had rebelled against the rest of the Heavenly Host when the angels conspired to bring about the Apocalypse.</p><p>“Why would you help us?” Sam asked. “Why break from the party line?”</p><p>“Fellas, I have a vested interest here,” Don said in a low whisper. “I’ve been cooped up for thousands of years, couldn’t even get a weekend off to visit your lovely little corner of the world. Now everything’s changed. It’s all hands on deck for the Apocalypse, and here I am. In the paradise God made for you.” He gestured at the bar. “I love it here.”</p><p>Dean stared the angel down.</p><p>“So, what? You want us to keep running? Keep the Apocalypse raging until you’ve filled up on piña coladas?”</p><p>“Not in the slightest. I can show you how to defeat Lucifer without becoming the Michael Sword.” Don’s gaze drifted to Sam. “And without Lucifer playing house inside of Sam. It just so happens that I’d get to stay on Earth as well. Win, win, win.”</p><p>Dean saw Sam’s Adam’s apple bob up and down as he swallowed hard. He could see the wheels spinning in his brother’s head, trying to work out the possibilities here. All told, Sam was in a much worse spot than Dean. Win or lose, Sam had flicked the switch on Judgment Day, and if the battle between the Winchester brothers did come to pass... Well, either the Devil would win, or Sam would be dead.</p><p>“We’re gonna need more than that,” Dean said. “We’ve got no reason to believe any of this crap.”</p><p>“Then let me give you the full picture,” Don said, anger brimming in his voice. “I’ve spent the last few thousand years as a warden with a very high-profile prisoner—until the day you boys let him spring the coop.” Don leaned in close, his breath washing over Dean’s face. Dean flinched. Guy should lay off the onion rings.</p><p>“I was stuck in Hell,” Don continued, “guarding the gates like a good soldier while you were off drinking demon blood and betraying your race. I had to watch souls screaming with no reprieve while Satan and his pals tortured them.” With that, he gave Dean a knowing look.</p><p>Dean felt his blood boil.</p><p>“That’s enough,” he growled, struggling to control himself. He had spent some quality time in Hell, and after experiencing the equivalent of thirty years of torture, he had accepted a bargain... Dean had tortured other souls in exchange for being taken off the rack himself. That moment of weakness had broken the first of the sixty-six Seals that had freed Lucifer.</p><p>Don looked over at Sam.</p><p>“And you just opened the back door for him,” he spat.</p><p>Sam’s fist clenched around the demon-killing knife. The blade pushed into the table’s wooden surface, carving out a deep gouge.</p><p>“I suffered for my work. For my creator. But now that Lucifer’s free, there’s nothing for me to guard. I get called up here, and what do I find out? God’s gone. MIA.”</p><p>“That’s not true,” Sam said softly, his eyes on Ruby’s knife. He had always had more faith than Dean, but that faith was being sorely tested these days. The archangel Raphael had claimed that God was gone, but how were they really to know? How was anyone—even the angels? If God didn’t want to be found, he wouldn’t be found. That didn’t stop Cass from searching for him (or her, Dean thought) across the whole damn planet.</p><p>“All that time spent in the pit, you hear things,” Don continued, ignoring Sam’s quiet riposte. “A lot of truly awful things, but every now and then... a secret. Something Lucifer didn’t want me to hear. A tiny clue as to how he can be defeated, earned by years of my suffering.”</p><p>“Can’t be true,” Dean said with a gravelly edge. “You’d have told the rest of the angel gang and we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”</p><p>“You don’t understand,” Don scolded. “Do you think, when all is said and done, that Michael will just kill Lucifer?”</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said grimly. For Sam, that was the central dilemma.</p><p>“Then you don’t know how Michael’s mind works. He’s going to defeat Lucifer, and then humiliate him. He’ll invent a new level of suffering even worse than Hell and stick Lucifer in it to wallow, and who do you think he’ll get to guard it?” Don was seething now, almost spitting as he spoke. “I’m not going back to Hell. Not after living up here.”</p><p>“And you know how to—“</p><p>“Kill Lucifer entirely? Remove the need for there to even be a Hell? Yes.” Don was suddenly icy calm, which was somehow creepier than his anger. “I’m gonna give you boys a minute to wrap your brains around all this,” he added with a broad smile as he stood up. “Even angels have to pee.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam watched Don disappear into the back hallway of the bar, uncertain if he should try to stop him. At this point, it didn’t seem like he was going to run off.</p><p>“What the hell was that?” Dean asked, his hands at his temples. He didn’t handle information dumps well.</p><p>“If it’s true—“</p><p>“Of course it’s not true,” Dean interrupted. “You think something like that would slip Cass’s mind? That Michael isn’t even going to off Lucifer?”</p><p>“He’s our friend, but he’s still an angel. He hasn’t always been honest with us before.” Sam knew that was hard for his brother to hear—Dean had been growing closer and closer to Cass since the angel had rebelled against Heaven.</p><p>Dean squinted at Sam, stupefied. “You’re not considering this, are you? Some crazy comes up from Hell and has an offer that’s too good to be true? This sounding familiar?”</p><p>“Is this about Ruby?” Sam asked pointedly. After all of the work the brothers had done to fix things between them, Sam’s relationship with Ruby was still a delicate subject. It would be off limits completely, if anything was off limits to Dean.</p><p>“This is about us wanting to get off the hook, to throw the yoke off our backs and let somebody else pull the load.”</p><p>Dean wasn’t entirely wrong, but that didn’t change the fact that they needed options. Before they met Don, their choices were either to accept Michael and Lucifer, or to let the world fall apart while they looked on.</p><p>“It’s not just our Apocalypse,” Sam said. “If Bobby came to us with another way to end the war, you’d listen.”</p><p>“Bobby’s different. Bobby’s human.”</p><p>“Who’s Bobby?” a voice asked from behind them. It was Don, back from the bathroom. Looking refreshed, he held up his hand to the bartender. “A round for me and my two new friends.”</p><p>The bartender threw a hardened, distrustful glance at Sam and Dean, then started to pour their beers.</p><p>“Bobby ain’t on your radar, and he’s not gonna be,” Dean replied.</p><p>Sam leaned toward Don cautiously, trying to extend an olive branch.</p><p>“Say we believe you. Say we’re even willing to help you. What happens next? Why do you need a couple of humans?”</p><p>“Because the book was written for humans,” Don responded, as if it was obvious.</p><p>“The book?” Sam asked, confused. “I thought you heard this from Lucifer directly?”</p><p>“That’s right. I heard about the book from Lucifer.”</p><p>“And?” Dean asked, annoyed.</p><p>“And what?”</p><p>“And what is it?” Dean spat out, the words almost falling on top of each other.</p><p>“A manual. A book of strategy, if you like, a... a war guide... A cheat sheet for the Apocalypse.”</p><p>“Written by?” Dean demanded.</p><p>Don grabbed a beer from the bartender’s outstretched hand.</p><p>“God,” he answered.</p><p>“And you walked away?! I knew y’all were idjits, I just didn’t know the extent.” Dean was always relieved to hear Bobby Singer’s voice, no matter how annoyed he sounded. He may not be blood, but he was the only family the boys had left.</p><p>“Told him we needed some time to think it over,” Dean said, shifting his cell phone away from his ear to protect his hearing from the auditory onslaught. Dean was alone in the fish-scented motel room while Sam had gone out for food. Dean found it hard to think on an empty stomach, and there was no way he was gonna share a meal with Don the d-bag angel.</p><p>“I bet you did. Did you also tell him to come and bring me some new damn legs?” Bobby responded with his usual rancor. Dean had forgotten momentarily about Bobby’s disability. Bobby had been stabbed by Ruby’s knife a few months back and become paralyzed, left to live out the Apocalypse in a wheelchair. It was the worst possible fate for a man who prided himself on being self-sufficient.</p><p>“I kept you out of it. The less the angels know about you, the better. For all of us,” Dean said.</p><p>“What, because I’m a slow-moving target now? I can take care of my damned self, Dean.” Bobby’s voice cracked slightly, betraying the hardship his impairment had caused.</p><p>“I know you can, Bobby,” Dean said, and then tried to reroute the conversation back into productive territory. “Do you know anything about this book? It’s called The War of the Sons of Light Against the Sons of Darkness.”</p><p>“Everybody’s heard of it,” Bobby replied, sounding more like his usual self. “It’s a segment of the Dead Sea Scrolls, and one of the most widely read apocryphal texts in Christendom. Trouble is, nobody’s read the ending.”</p><p>“Why’s that?”</p><p>“Because it don’t exist. When the scrolls went up for sale in ‘54 there was a big to-do. Somebody broke into the Waldorf Astoria, where they were being auctioned, and the next day they couldn’t find the last page, what they called the ‘War Scroll.’ Lore says it was destroyed... That the Devil didn’t like what it had to say.”</p><p>So much for an easy answer, Dean thought. But at least Don’s story checks out.</p><p>“And the bit he said about it being a field guide to the End Times?”</p><p>“More like a field guide to gutting the Devil,” Bobby said grimly. “It gets pretty specific. Battle formations, a timeline, you name it. But that last page... how to defeat Satan himself? That could change everything.”</p><p>“Thanks for keeping expectations low, Bobby. So if it’s been destroyed, how does Don the angel lead us to it?”</p><p>“Should of asked him instead of storming off, dimwit.” There was a pause on the other end of the line. “Could be it wasn’t destroyed, just hidden. Put someplace safe where Lucifer knew no one would find it.”</p><p>“So all we have to do is find something hidden by the Devil himself. Easy peasy.”</p><p>Dean heard the door open behind him, letting a gust of cold air rush in, rustling the drapes and sending a chill down his spine. He turned to see Sam enter the room, a guilty look on his face.</p><p>“Bobby, I’ve gotta go...”</p><p>And then Dean saw him. Don the angel, striding in right after Sam.</p><p>“Sam, what the hell’s going on?” Dean dropped the cell phone to his side, but could still hear Bobby’s tinny voice calling out from the speaker.</p><p>“Dean, I’m sorry. Really, I am. But you’re not the one that’s facing an angel firing squad no matter what he does.” Sam tried to hold eye contact with Dean, but the older Winchester looked away. He stared instead at Don, who was still wearing that damn Hawaiian shirt.</p><p>“What did you say to him?” Dean asked the angel harshly.</p><p>“I told him the truth. That you’ll understand it all in time.” Don’s words were the last thing Dean heard before the sudden, precipitous drop.</p><p>Sam awoke to the sound of screaming, terrifyingly close. It was accompanied by the thrashing wails of some sort of otherworldly creature. The noise rattled the air around him, and then gave way to a man’s shouting. And was that... music? What the hell happened? He was totally alone in a dark, curving hallway, both ends of which were obscured by turns. Coming from one direction was the sound of screaming. From the other, silence. This is how a hunter’s instincts can get you in trouble, Sam thought as he slowly stood, his legs faltering, and walked carefully toward the maelstrom. Most people would run away from screaming. Thanks for the death wish, Dad.</p><p>As he rounded the corner, he started at the sight before him. His brother, clearly in a similar state of shock, stood in the flickering light of an old-fashioned movie theater. On the silver screen, a massive squid attacked a submarine while sailors threw harpoons at its colossal eye. Sam reached way back into his childhood memories. The Nautilus? Is that 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea? Sam was stupefied. What did Don do to us?</p><p>He saw an exit sign and pushed his stupefied older brother toward it. They stumbled outside and squinted as the afternoon sun temporarily blinded them. Blinking, Sam looked up at the impossibly bright sky and saw the silhouette of a massive building. The Empire State Building, he thought. A classic cherry-colored car motored past them, in pristine condition. Happy families strode down the sidewalk, wearing outfits straight out of Back to the Future. Sam stared at them. Something’s gone really wrong.</p><p>He looked over at Dean, who looked back at him, an I-told-you-so look on his face.</p><p>“Dude. I think that dick sent us back to 1954.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The time-travelers stood on the sidewalk, completely stunned. A crowd of women in full skirts, hats and gloves, and men in sharp suits and derbies flowed around them. In their Levi’s and leather jackets, Dean realized the Winchester boys looked out of place in the smart corporate landscape, to say the least.</p><p>That winged chimp really has sent us back to what looks like New York in 1954, he thought, his brain struggling to process. It seemed Don had dropped them smack dab in the middle of Times Square, but there wasn’t a camera-wielding tourist anywhere in sight. The place was also suspiciously clean and quiet, no crumpled piles of paper or garbage, and no blaring rap music emanating from any of the stores nearby.</p><p>“First, we get our bearings, then I beat your ass,” Dean announced.</p><p>“I didn’t—“ Sam began.</p><p>“Don’t, Sam. Nothing you can possibly say will make up for you throwing us under the bus, again.”</p><p>“You’re not the only one with a stake in this, Dean. That means, sometimes, you follow my plan.”</p><p>Dean scanned the bustling crowd, wary of continuing this discussion in public.</p><p>“Alright, smarty-pants. You wanted to do the time warp again, so what’s the next move?”</p><p>“We get off the street.”</p><p>On that point, Dean had to agree with his brother. Trying their best to blend into the crowd, they quickly turned and headed north toward Central Park.</p><p>Dean deftly grabbed a New York Herald Tribune from a green newsstand that squatted on the corner of 47^th^ and Broadway. Some things don’t change, no matter what era you are in; sleight of hand is still sleight of hand. Dean peered at the date: June 26^th^, 1954. He shook his head. That asshole had shot them back almost half a century without even an explanation of where or how to find the War Scroll.</p><p>Despite their predicament, Sam was smiling.</p><p>“This is amazing,” he said.</p><p>“What are you, Buddy the Elf, fresh from the North Pole?” Dean chided. “We’ve been to New York a dozen times.”</p><p>“Yeah, but how many times have we been to the fifties?” Sam retorted.</p><p>“The real fun starts in the sixties.”</p><p>As they crossed a busy intersection, a man in a trench coat clipped Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>“Hey, watch it buddy,” Dean said with automatic vitriol, but when he looked at the guy, for a half-second he thought he saw the face of Castiel. The man looked up in alarm, and Dean realized his mistake. It wasn’t Cass, and they didn’t know anyone in 1954. There wasn’t a friendly face for miles, or decades for that matter.</p><p>The boys were no strangers to angelic time jumps—they had been through this before, when Anna tried to kill John and Mary Winchester in 1978, and when Cass took Dean back to 1973. The past wasn’t something Dean liked to visit or even remember, and now he was back. Plus, he was super hungry—another drawback to time travel.</p><p>Sam looked over his shoulder at the man in the trench coat, and then back at Dean.</p><p>“Dude, this isn’t the New York we’re familiar with. Try to be a little less conspicuous.”</p><p>As they left Times Square, Sam took one last look. Rather than the giant three-story-high video screens back in the present day, the streets were lined with theaters and coffee shops. The iconic signs that had made the square famous were mazes of neon. A two-story-high Pepsi Cola bottle-cap sign mooned over the square, which was filled not with mid-western tourists in fanny packs, but a vital post-war workforce eager to create the American dream. The fifties saw the beginning of the consumer society that perpetuated after World War II; buying things created a wealthy America, and the indications were all around them. A Chevrolet sign topped a building, under which was a Canadian Club Scotch Whiskey sign, and below that was the large-toothed smiling face of Ed Sullivan, hanging off the side of the building in front of them.</p><p>Sam grabbed Dean’s arm.</p><p>“We could go see The Ed Sullivan Show!”</p><p>Dean looked at his brother scornfully.</p><p>“Sam, I’m not hanging around here playing Mad Men with you. We get the page from those scrolls, and somehow have Don get us back to 2010. Nothing else.”</p><p>“I just thought we could take in this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see living legends... living.”</p><p>Dean made his way up Broadway, and Sam followed a few steps behind. Dean took a right at 55^th^ Street, and he seemed to know exactly where he was headed as he crossed the street, dodging in between cars. Good thing there are no jaywalking tickets in the 1950s, Sam mused.</p><p>Dean pushed in the door to the Carnegie Deli and Sam dutifully followed him inside, knowing there was no point in resisting his brother’s appetite.</p><p>They slid into a booth looking out onto 7^th^ Avenue. Dean didn’t need to look at a menu; this was the only place in the whole wide world where Dean’s favorite thing diverged from his usual bacon cheeseburger. A waitress appeared at their table in a full pink skirt edged with white bric-a-brac.</p><p>“What can I get you gentlemen?” she asked with a heavy New York accent.</p><p>Dean smiled for the first time that day.</p><p>“I’ll have a pastrami on rye, extra mustard, potato salad, and a root beer, please.”</p><p>Sam shook his head. Nothing makes Dean happier than a meal. He looked up from his menu.</p><p>“I’ll have the turkey Reuben, light on the Russian dressing, and a side of coleslaw,” he said. The waitress nodded and scribbled on her pad.</p><p>“Comin’ right up,” she said and smiled as she left to place the order.</p><p>Once she was out of earshot, Dean looked expectantly at his brother.</p><p>“Alright, captain. What’s the plan?”</p><p>Sam had been pondering their next move, but hadn’t come up with any bright ideas yet. They knew very little about the location of the War Scroll, only what was publicly available on the internet in 2010. What they did know was that a private sale happened at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on July 1^st^ —in just five days. But how would they even get close to infiltrating that transaction?</p><p>“Well, we could try to get jobs at the Waldorf,” he said. “We wouldn’t call any attention to ourselves if we actually worked there.”</p><p>Dean shrugged. Getting a real job wasn’t their usual process, mostly they just pretended to be FBI agents, or priests, or CDC inspectors. Doing actual work wasn’t part of Dean’s modus operandi. But, considering the circumstances, they didn’t have a choice. They didn’t know nearly enough about the time period to successfully pass as government officials.</p><p>Their sandwiches arrived, five inches of beautiful meat piled onto freshly baked bread. Dean was beside himself with joy.</p><p>Minutes later, Dean was finishing up his pickle and the last bite of his sandwich. As they got up to leave, Dean looked at the check and pulled a ten spot out of his pocket. They walked past the young waitress on their way out.</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said, giving her a big smile.</p><p>She coyly lilted back. “No, thank you.”</p><p>Dean pulled open the door of the deli and looked back to smile smugly at Sam.</p><p>“Looks like Betty Draper has a thing for me.”</p><p>“You’re gonna wanna run, Dean,” Sam said with an equally smug look.</p><p>Dean looked at him questioningly. Then they heard a woman’s voice yelling after them.</p><p>“Stop those men!”</p><p>They looked back at the waitress, who was holding the very modern ten dollar bill Dean had just put down.</p><p>Without a second thought, Sam bolted down the street with Dean a step behind him. They dodged through stalled traffic at the intersection, nearly causing a pile-up when the light turned green.</p><p>Moments later they were casually sauntering east on 54^th^ Street.</p><p>“To the Waldorf?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Guess so,” Sam replied. He took out his BlackBerry, intending to Google the hotel’s location. Instead, he stared at the mess of jumbled pixels on the phone’s LCD. Not only would it have no signal in the fifties, the phone’s hardware had been damaged. Either time travel does a job on electronics, or it broke in the fall, he sumised. He quickly put it back in his pocket, not wanting to draw any more attention to them with his anachronistic device.</p><p>“Hey, what time is it?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know, my phone’s useless,” Sam answered.</p><p>“Yeah, mine too. Won’t turn on.”</p><p>Sam shielded his eyes and looked up at the sun.</p><p>“Maybe an hour till sunset,” he said. “On second thought, let’s find a place to crash first. I don’t know if it was the time travel or the dine-and-dash, but—“</p><p>“But little Sammy could use a nap?” Dean quipped.</p><p>“Take a look in the mirror,” Sam replied. “The bags under your eyes have bags under their eyes.”</p><p>“And whose fault is that? You think maybe all of your shenanigans are finally taking their toll on me?”</p><p>The brothers continued to bicker until they passed a block of pre-war apartments called the Villard Houses. A sign in front advertised a ‘vacency,’ which Sam figured was close enough, and they strolled into the building and up to apartment 3E.</p><p>An old woman answered the door, and directed them to take a look at the apartment across the hall. It had clearly once been part of a larger penthouse, but had been walled off into a smaller dwelling with a half kitchen, bedroom and adjoining living room. After years of living in dilapidated motels and the backseat of the Impala, the boys weren’t picky. With literally no money to their names—at least any they could actually use—Dean asked the landlady if he could give her the rent at the end of the week. She agreed; she just needed their names. They offered up two aliases. Sam was so tired that he couldn’t even place which band they said they came from.</p><p>Unfortunately for the Winchesters, the one thing the apartment didn’t have was a bed.</p><p>“Couldn’t we have just stayed at the Waldorf?” Dean said grumpily.</p><p>“You think they’d let us pay at the end of the week, genius?” Sam replied. Before Dean could respond, Sam went to the bathroom. He climbed into the claw-footed bathtub and rolled his coat underneath his head. It wasn’t nearly big enough for him, but he didn’t care.</p><p>Within a minute, he was asleep.</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Barney Doyle’s back was killing him. Most boys his age were learning to drive, dating girls, and having fun, but that wasn’t a possibility for Barney. His mother had been taken ill, forcing the fifteen year-old to find a job and take responsibility for her care.</p><p>There weren’t any grown men left in the Doyle’s Breezy Point, Queens house—just Barney and his mother. His father had passed away three years before, so when his uncle James had said that there was an opening for another security guard at the Waldorf Astoria, Barney’s mother believed it was a sign from Heaven. She was Catholic, of course, and she took her brother’s news as an answer to her prayers.</p><p>Although he normally hated his job, Barney had been looking forward to today. He and his uncle had taken one of the hotel’s trucks and were on their way over to Red Hook to pick up a box that had been shipped over from Israel, or someplace equally exotic.</p><p>Barney hadn’t paid much attention while he was still in school, so he wasn’t quite sure where Israel even was. He knew that it was a new country, and was somehow controversial, especially with his mother. Barney wished he had been better about his studies, not that it mattered now. He was stuck in this job and as far as he could see you didn’t need much learning to be a security guard.</p><p>When James and Barney arrived at the Red Hook Docks, a worker signaled for them to park at dock thirty-six. The truck bumped its way over the pier. They waited. The diesel engine was spewing exhaust almost directly into the cab, but Barney didn’t mind. This was a nice change from the boredom of the hotel.</p><p>A large burly guy in a white T-shirt banged his fist on the front of the truck.</p><p>“You guys from the Waldorf?”</p><p>James pulled his heft out of the truck to answer the guy face-to-face.</p><p>“Sure are.”</p><p>“Sign here,” the burly guy said as he shoved a clipboard at James. He signed without reading the form.</p><p>Handing it back, he asked, “Where is it?”</p><p>The burly guy motioned behind him.</p><p>“Carton five. Says it’s extremely fragile.” he replied, then walked away.</p><p>Barney leapt out of the truck to help his uncle with the carton. It was about four feet by two feet wide, made of fresh pine. The pungent tar smell tickled Barney’s nose as he bent down to inspect the roughly hewn container.</p><p>“Stop dicking around and help me get it into the truck,” James growled as he attempted to get his short arms around the base. Barney complied, hastily grabbing hold of his end. “Lift up your side more,” his uncle said.</p><p>“I am lifting,” Barney replied, watching as his uncle struggled to negotiate the carton over his stomach. His side was already much higher than James’s on account of his height, plus he wasn’t nearly as tubby.</p><p>Holding the container awkwardly between them, they managed to crab walk around to the back of the truck and the closed back doors.</p><p>“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph. Why didn’t you open the doors beforehand?” James demanded, breathing heavily.</p><p>“‘Cause you didn’t tell me to,” Barney said, staring at his uncle.</p><p>“Well, put your side down first and open the door.”</p><p>Barney squatted, holding his side of the carton. As he got it to knee height, his uncle’s grip faltered. The shift in weight distribution caused Barney to lose his hold, and the corner of the wooden crate hit the ground with a heavy thud.</p><p>Barney looked up in shock as his uncle swore at the top of his lungs. As he made the sign of the cross over his chest, James simultaneously cursed Barney to Hell.</p><p>Barney blushed a deep scarlet. “It’s fine, Uncle James. Let’s check it. I’m sure it’s fine.”</p><p>They pried a corner of the carton up, and Barney saw that the contents were packed densely with hay. James pushed Barney out of the way and with one hand pulled the rest of the top off. Stuffing his pudgy hand into the hay, he revealed a clay pot. It was tall, burnt orange in color, with a good bit of dirt on it. James wiped away more of the hay, and revealed three more jars.</p><p>As James inspected the first jar, its cover slid off the top and onto the ground, landing with a heavy crack. A strange, putrid smell emanated from the urn, which reminded Barney of the stench when the pilot light on their gas oven went out.</p><p>When his uncle opened his mouth, Barney readied himself, sure that his uncle was going to berate him, despite the accident being his fault. However, before James could start yelling, the oddest thing happened—he choked. It was as if he was vomiting in reverse, with oily bursts of black smoke flying into his mouth and down his throat.</p><p>Barney gaped as his uncle reached out toward him, and then everything went dark.</p><p>Sam and Dean sat on a hard fake leather couch outside the Waldorf’s general manager’s office. The rickety side table next to Dean was piled with magazines. He slid one off the top and showed it to Sam.</p><p>“Yum. Eva Marie Saint.” Dean leered at the picture of the young starlet with her blonde hair swept back, very nicely filling out a blue sweater. “From TV stardom to the movie Waterfront,” Dean said, reading off the cover.</p><p>“She’s an old woman.” Sam said, rolling his eyes at his brother’s incredible capacity for horniness.</p><p>“Not now she isn’t.” Dean almost jumped in excitement. “Marilyn, I want to meet Marilyn, do you think she stays here?”</p><p>“We didn’t travel over five decades back in time so you could sleep with a couple of starlets,” Sam replied.</p><p>Dean furrowed his brow. “It wasn’t my idea to travel here, period. Besides, these women are icons, Sam. Completely different. If we have any free time after we nick the War Scroll, I’m going to find Marilyn.”</p><p>“Okay, Dean.” Sam shook his head.</p><p>“Sam and Dean Winchester?”</p><p>Dean flinched at the sound of his own name before quickly remembering that Sam had given it to the receptionist when they applied. Apparently, being this far removed from their own time meant that caution could be thrown out the window.</p><p>The man who had spoken wore a three-piece suit and was holding open a door that lead into an interior office.</p><p>“I’m Ernest Harold, General Support Manager at the Waldorf. Please come in.” The man graciously swept his hand toward his office.</p><p>Sam and Dean settled into a couple of leather chairs on one side of the man’s very messy desk.</p><p>“Terribly sorry about the clutter,” Mr. Harold said, shuffling some papers around. “I have 200 employees to oversee and I can’t seem to manage all the paperwork. As you know, this is a prestigious establishment, with a rich history of providing impeccable accommodations to the most discerning travelers, statesmen and royalty throughout the world.”</p><p>“And Marilyn Monroe,” Dean offered.</p><p>Mr. Harold frowned. “The privacy of our clients is of the utmost importance in this position. You will work closely with people that you see on the silver screen every day. We do not allow any... fraternizing with the hotel’s guests.”</p><p>“Of course not.” Sam leaned forward. “We completely understand. My brother is a fan, but he’s a very reserved fan. Aren’t you, Dean?”</p><p>Dean smiled tightly. “Yes. Haven’t fraternized in months, myself.”</p><p>“Of course. So, tell me a little about yourselves,” Mr. Harold said, leaning back in his chair. “Whatever you would like to share.”</p><p>This struck Dean as sort of funny—What could they possibly share with this over-stuffy dope? He decided to be straightforward.</p><p>“Sir. Mr. Harold—Ernest. My brother and I are new in town. And, frankly, we don’t have any money. But we are hard-working, strong, and charming. We can do anything you need us to.”</p><p>The dude seemed to be impressed.</p><p>“You remind me of someone,” he said, peering at Dean. “Have you been to the pictures and seen On the Waterfront yet?”</p><p>Dean leaned back, smiling. “Classic Brando.”</p><p>“Classic? He’s a very new actor. At least, I believe he is.” Ernest looked confused.</p><p>Dean stuttered hastily. “I meant to say a new, classic-looking actor.”</p><p>“Ahh, you’re right. I do love a good picture.” Ernest swept his hair out of his eyes, then turned his attention to Sam. “And you.”</p><p>“I’ll do whatever you need me to do, sir,” Sam said.</p><p>“Well, you both are fine fellows.” Ernest got up and moved around his desk. “But I have only one position available. Congratulations, Mr. Winchester.” He stuck his hand out toward Dean.</p><p>“Thank you, sir,” Dean said with a smile as they shook hands. “You won’t regret it.”</p><p>“I’m sure I won’t. Go see Mable in uniforms. She’ll set you up. I have paperwork for you to fill out, but we can do that later. I expect you’ll make about twenty dollars in tips—“</p><p>Dean nodded. “Not bad.”</p><p>“—a week,” Ernest finished.</p><p>He shuffled them out the door.</p><p>“Go up these stairs and all the way to the end of the hall. And Sam. Might I suggest you get a haircut? This isn’t Amsterdam.”</p><p>For Dean, it was the perfect end to a perfect interview.</p><p>“Sorry Sammy, guess you’re too European to work this town. Maybe try again in the 1970s.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I’m going to the public library to see what I can find. Besides, I think you’re better cut out for this part of the plan. You know, the mindless labor.”</p><p>Dean nodded proudly and disappeared into a door marked “Uniforms.”</p><p>Sam’s immediate concern was to find someone in the city who could translate the scrolls. Without Bobby as a resource, and with all of their lore books sitting in the Impala’s trunk back in 2010, it would be nearly impossible for Sam to do the translating himself. Not that I’m entirely sure what language they’ll be written in. Thinking things through, he realized that they were going to need some heavy-duty artillery—it was unlikely the scrolls’ owner would hand them over without a fight. Anyway, Sam felt naked without a firearm.</p><p>While Sam was contemplating that dilemma, Dean appeared in the doorway wearing a burgundy wool bellhop jacket with golden rope tassels hanging from the sides and gleaming brass buttons down the front. A petit fez perched on his head, with a braided, golden chinstrap pinching his scowling face.</p><p>Sam smirked.</p><p>Dean stepped past him.</p><p>“Don’t say anything.”</p><p>That afternoon, Dean found himself lugging a seemingly endless stream of leather suitcases up to various different guests’ rooms. He quickly bonded with Rick, the African-American elevator operator, and they were soon discussing baseball as Dean rode between floors.</p><p>After a particularly heavy set of bags, Dean was not-so-attentively leaning against the lobby’s centerpiece—a large, statuesque clock trimmed in gold leaf—when a girl who looked to be in her mid-twenties approached the front desk. She was wearing a royal blue suit with a pencil skirt, and a pillbox hat that matched her canary-yellow shoes. A cabbie brought a suitcase in and dropped it at her feet. She tipped him elegantly and he bowed his head before heading back outside.</p><p>“Ms. Julia Wilder checking in, please,” she said to the receptionist. Her brunette hair was pulled back, and Dean noticed with surprise a long scar on the side of her neck.</p><p>The young woman turned her head toward Dean, looking him up and down. Her glare was so intense that Dean felt as though she’d just given him the third degree without even speaking a word. She turned her head back to the front desk and demurely pulled her hair over the scar. Dean kept staring, transfixed by her lithe but strong legs and her serious demeanor. She’s hot, he thought. Maybe I won’t have to track down Marilyn after all.</p><p>Dean sidled up to her, completely forgetting he was supposed to be working.</p><p>“Hi,” he said giving her the full-on hundred-watt Dean Winchester smile.</p><p>The girl ignored him. Had she known more about Dean, she wouldn’t have bothered.</p><p>“You here for business or pleasure?” he asked. “Or just to see the big clock?”</p><p>She looked at him. “May I help you?”</p><p>“No. But I could help you,” Dean whispered. “Maybe I could buy you a drink?”</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“You here with your husband?” Dean probed.</p><p>“I’m not here to socialize. I’m here for an auction.”</p><p>“Dead Sea Scrolls?” Dean asked without thinking.</p><p>She squinted at him.</p><p>“No,” she said.</p><p>“Excuse me, boy,” interjected the desk clerk. “Are you going to get the lady’s bags?” He eyed Dean with venom.</p><p>“Of course.” Dean bent down, but before he could grab the suitcase, Stevie, a smelly kid from New Jersey who wore his bellhop pants a little too tight in Dean’s opinion, swiped the bag and placed it on a cart. He wheeled away, Ms. Wilder striding behind him.</p><p>Dean stood by the reception desk shell-shocked, though still alert enough to salute when Ms. Wilder turned to take one last look at him before entering the elevator. It was rare for a woman to truly grab his attention as she had. Of course, he’d faked interest plenty of times; it used to be a hobby of his while he and Sam were in between cases. Dean would bet himself just how many minutes it would take him to convince the bartender, waitress, or lonely female patron into his bed. Dean’s belt notches were many. But this girl... this girl seemed special.</p><p>Not far away, Sam sat in the main branch of the New York Public Library. Rows of shelves lined every inch of the room; thousands upon thousands of books, and not an Internet connection in sight. Sam didn’t mind doing the research, but Google had become his crutch, and he felt handicapped without it.</p><p>First he pulled a series of books on archeological digs, but found very little information. After trawling through the card catalog, he decided to look at the archived New York newspapers. The scrolls, Sam remembered, had been first discovered in 1947, so there must be at least one article somewhere that could lead them to a contact. After fruitlessly pouring over several months’ worth of broadsheets, Sam was flipping through a June 1^th^Wall Street Journal when he spotted a small ad in the classified section:</p><p>Four Dead Sea Scrolls, Biblical Manuscripts. Would make an ideal gift to an educational or religious institution.</p><p>The ad gave a local number and an address, which Sam jotted down on a scrap of paper and slipped in his pocket. That was as solid a lead as he was going to find on the scrolls themselves—now they just needed a translator. He wished that Don had briefed them a little more thoroughly before the unceremonious time-jacking. Sam regretted going behind Dean’s back to talk to the angel, but at the time, there seemed to be no other choice. The secret fear that Sam had been carrying around since they got to 1954 was that they would never find their way back. What if they were unable to procure the War Scroll—would Don just leave them to rot?</p><p>Without occult books to refer to, Sam was limited to commonly available biblical texts. I don’t even know Don’s real name, Sam realized. All I know is his job description: guardian of Hell’s gates.</p><p>Luckily, that was all he needed.</p><p>Flipping through an especially old book, Sam found a list of angel names and one in particular stuck out: Abaddon, Guardian of the Gates. Don, Abaddon—has to be the same guy, Sam thought. Further down the page, the book traced Abaddon’s motley history. Scholars couldn’t seem to decide on the angel’s true nature, some believed that he was among the most powerful of the Heavenly Host, others claimed he was fallen and in league with Satan. In fact, in some places, Abaddon was used as an alternate name for Hell, and even the Devil himself. Great, Sam thought.</p><p>For the moment, Sam decided that he wouldn’t share those particular juicy details with Dean. I’m in enough hot water with him as it is, he figured. But, to be safe, he discreetly tore the relevant page out of the book and slid it into his pocket, alongside the scrap of paper with the information from the advert. If it turned out that Don had less than angelic intentions, Sam wanted to be ready.</p><p>Dean tugged at the chinstrap on his hat. He needed a break. Mercifully, the lobby was quiet and the dickhead front desk guys were engrossed in their work. He made his way downstairs and threaded his way through the halls under the building, finally reaching a set of steel doors. Throwing caution to the wind, he swung them open.</p><p>A hotel security guard stood on the other side with his back to Dean, and a box truck idled outside the loading dock. The man was tubby and middle-aged. He turned around slowly, looking as if he’d been caught committing a crime.</p><p>Dean politely nodded a greeting. “Guess I’m lost,” he said. “Where’s the little boys’ room?”</p><p>Instead of answering out loud, the man simply pointed back the way Dean had come.</p><p>“Great,” Dean said. He was about to call off his reconnaissance mission, when he saw what the security guard had been hovering over—it was a simple wooden crate, damaged on one end, covered in strange characters. Probably worth getting a better look at, Dean decided. “Actually... I think I can hold it,” he said. “I’m gonna get some fresh air.”</p><p>Under the guard’s watchful eye, Dean maneuvered his way past the crate and to the edge of the loading dock, but he wasn’t able to get a better look at the contents. Damn security goon and his thighs, Dean thought. He jumped off the loading dock and walked down the alleyway, rounding the corner onto Park Avenue, then stopped.</p><p>Hebrew? Could the lettering have been Hebrew? By pure chance, he may have just come impossibly close to the scrolls, and he couldn’t pass up such an opportunity—even if that meant beating the ass of a civilian. He turned around and started back to the loading dock.</p><p>James peered inside the truck. Barney’s crumpled body was pushed to one side on the floor, his neck twisted at an unnatural angle. The sight of his nephew’s corpse prompted no reaction in James. If anything did, it was the smell. Meat, James thought. Still fresh.</p><p>James turned and grabbed a black rubber hose attached to a waterspout. He turned on the water and sprayed down the inside of the truck. The water ran pink as it flowed out and over the bumper. He turned off the hose and pulled Barney’s body onto the dock. Then he picked the body up easily with one hand, opened the top of the crate and pushed it inside.</p><p>Clunking the crate closed, James wheeled the carton into the back of the Waldorf Astoria.</p><p>It’s still safe, he thought with pride. She’ll be pleased with me.</p><p>Holding onto his stupid bellhop hat, Dean hurried back down the alleyway. He slid back around the corner just as James disappeared into the hotel. With finesse, he jumped onto the dock and banged through the steel doors.</p><p>The security guard and the carton were gone.</p><p>After a couple more unproductive hours at the library, Sam decided to stop off at the new apartment; he wanted to call Dean. As he fiddled with the key in the lock, he noticed out of the corner of his eye one of their neighbors walking toward him down the hallway. He half-nodded a greeting as the young woman brushed past him in the narrow corridor, briefly glancing up to admire her petite dark-haired figure as she moved away from him, before carrying on fiddling with the stubborn lock.</p><p>Finally there was a click as the key connected with the mechanism and Sam managed to get the door open. By this point his mind had wandered far from the mission at hand to fantasies about living a normal life—one that held room for girls and movie dates and romantic dinners. It all came crashing back as he took in the sight before him. The apartment had been completely ransacked.</p><p>Sam wondered how, after being in 1954 for less than twenty-four hours, he and Dean had already made an enemy.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>No sulphur, Sam noted, sniffing the air. It wasn’t a demon.</p><p>He kicked at the shards of glass that littered the scummy tile floor of the apartment’s tiny bathroom. The intruder had been thorough, upending or smashing just about every object in the small space that wasn’t built into the floor. They even smashed the toilet, Sam realized. The bathroom mirror had also been broken, which accounted for all the glass on the floor. Just what we need, he thought, more bad luck. Sam closed the water valve leading to the sputtering half-toilet.</p><p>It wasn’t like there was much to steal. They had been whisked through time with only the clothes on their backs and the contents of their pockets. Who had done this? Were there angels here too? Sam wondered, a nervous chill running through him.</p><p>He felt helpless. Lost in an unfamiliar time and place, with all his usual tools unavailable to him, and the end of the world in sight. Because of me, he remembered. I did this.My fear, my weakness, brought on the end for everybody. In these moments, when the guilt overwhelmed him, and images of the billions who would die filled his mind, Sam craved the blood. It didn’t make any sense. Demon blood had given him strength, but it had also clouded his judgment. It had made him turn his back on Dean, the only person who could ever truly understand Sam’s situation.</p><p>It had made him start the Apocalypse.</p><p>Despite all of that, Sam craved it for one simple reason: it made him feel powerful. The demon blood unlocked something deep within him, something that had been left there by Azazel, the yellow-eyed demon who had killed their mother, Mary Winchester, and marked Sam as part of his growing army of special, part-demonic children. Sam was the only one left alive. Was that why I was chosen to be Lucifer’s vessel? Because Azazel made me this way? Because I was the most special of the special? Or simply because I survived?</p><p>Sam moved cautiously back to the main room, pushing those uncomfortable thoughts from his mind. The lock on the front door didn’t show any signs of being forced, though it had been difficult to open. Sam was definitely paranoid enough to have checked the locks in both the door’s handle and the deadbolt when he left a few hours earlier. He scanned the main room of the apartment for other entry points. There was a small, metal-barred window overlooking the street.</p><p>Looking down, Sam saw the bustle of a New York street at midday. The window was high enough up that it would take a ladder and some patience to get to it, making it unlikely someone would be able to break in without attracting attention. Not that Sam was sure the good people of New York would bat an eyelash at broad-daylight larceny, but the window’s metal bars were still firmly in place.</p><p>Attached to the main room was a small kitchenette, much like the ones in motels that the Winchesters had become intimately familiar with over the last few years. Scratch that, Sam thought, I’ve become familiar with. Dean never, ever cooked... unless you counted assembling bread and shoplifted deli meat as cooking. Even when they were kids and Dean was ostensibly the caretaker, Sam had had to fend for himself.</p><p>Inside the kitchenette was a window, taller than the one in the living room, and covered by a garish red curtain. Pushing the curtain aside, Sam saw the rusted metal of a fire escape. Mystery solved.</p><p>Put bars on the inaccessible window, but don’t even put a lock on the fire escape? Different time, Sam thought. The question now was the motivation for the break-in. Sam and Dean didn’t look rich, or important. Could someone already know about us? About our mission here?</p><p>Sam briefly considered keeping the burglary to himself and avoiding Dean’s inevitable freak-out. The boys had spent a considerable portion of their time together on the run—from law enforcement, vampires, shapeshifters, demons, Hellhounds... and now the forces of Heaven. Knowing they were being followed after less than a day in 1954 wasn’t going to go over well.</p><p>Sam reached for his BlackBerry, realizing again as he did so that it wouldn’t work. Living without technology is a bitch. How did Don Draper do it? But calling Dean wouldn’t have been an option anyway, since his BlackBerry wasn’t in his pocket.</p><p>It was the one thing he had left in the rented apartment, knowing that it would be useless in 1954. Stupid, he berated himself. It was a rookie mistake, one his father would never have made. Sam checked his other pockets, finding his wallet intact alongside a pack of gum. Reaching into his jacket pocket, Sam’s heart sank. Something else was missing, and it was a much bigger deal than a useless cell phone.</p><p>Ruby’s knife.</p><p>The one weapon the boys had had with them had vanished from the inside pocket of Sam’s jacket somewhere between the library and the apartment. It was, as far as Sam and Dean knew, one of a kind.</p><p>And now it was gone.</p><p>Dean may not have been the smartest Winchester, and he certainly wasn’t the one you wanted to help translate an ancient document, but after years of digging through yellowed lore books, he had picked up a few things. He knew, for example, that when he saw crazy-ass lettering, he was better off calling Sam than trying to figure it out himself. Dean figured his value came more from his ‘give ‘em hell’ attitude than from his G.E.D.</p><p>The symbols on the side of the crate certainly fell into the ‘crazy-ass’ category. Was it Hebrew, or something older? A crate with biblical text on it getting dropped off at the Waldorf? This is almost too easy, Dean thought. All he had to do was follow it to its destination, grab the scroll, and get clear of the place before any more hot girls saw him in his embarrassing monkey suit.</p><p>Trouble was, Dean had already lost the crate. The workman who had delivered it must have slipped into the service elevator while Dean was sorting all of this out in his head.</p><p>He hurried along the loading dock to the service elevator’s oversized doors. As he reached out to press the ‘down’ button, assuming that’s where the crate was headed, the doors sprang open.</p><p>“A lot of guests need their luggage taken to the loading dock?” asked the mustached man who was waiting in the elevator. Dean recognized him as one of the asshole desk clerks from upstairs.</p><p>“Uh, yeah, lady wanted to see the...” Dean trailed off, looking around the poorly lit dock for anything that could possibly interest a guest, “the place where we keep the carts.” He gestured weakly toward a line of derelict luggage carts parked in the corner.</p><p>The clerk stared hard at Dean for an excruciatingly long moment, then cracked a wry smile.</p><p>“Kind of an unspoken rule that we wait until our shift’s over, buddy,” the man said, patting Dean on the back. “If a lady wants to see your, uh, cart, she’ll still wanna see it after you’re done working.” He pulled Dean into the elevator by the shoulder, but Dean resisted.</p><p>“Maybe give me a minute here?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You got a phone call. Your dad.”</p><p>Dean shrugged the man’s hand off his shoulder and forced open the closing elevator doors. John Winchester had been dead for years, or, depending on how you looked at it, was not even born yet.</p><p>“My what?” Dean demanded, suddenly deadly serious.</p><p>“Or brother? Or your cousin? I don’t know. Some guy. Sounded kind of annoyed. And annoying, for that matter.” The man pulled Dean’s hand off the elevator door, which continued to close. “And here’s a pro tip. Don’t actually try anything on those carts. You’ll end up rolling all over the place, the lady will bonk her head, and it’ll be all tears and whining for the rest of the night. Trust me.”</p><p>It wasn’t a dignified position to be in, but Sam didn’t have a choice. He was on his hands and knees, clawing around the base of the phone booth for dropped change. He had only had a few coins, and Dean was taking his sweet time to get to the phone. Probably got distracted, Sam thought. If he’s with a woman...</p><p>“Sam, that you?” a voice sounded through the phone.</p><p>“Dean! I’ve been waiting a—“</p><p>“Yeah, ‘bout that, couldn’t you have waited a little longer to check in on me, Mom? Made me lose a lead on our scrolls.”</p><p>“I’m not checking in,” Sam said, aggravated. “I thought you’d want to know we got robbed.”</p><p>“We? I didn’t get robbed. All I own here is this stupid hat, and I sure as hell still have that.”</p><p>“Our apartment was broken into—“</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“They tore the place apart.” Sam started to pace with the phone, then realized there was only a foot of space for him to move either way in the booth. He suddenly understood why cordless phones had been invented.</p><p>“Calm down, big guy. You sound a little pissed.” Dean said, lowering his voice.</p><p>“They took... my BlackBerry.”</p><p>“Yeah, that’s rough Sammy,” Dean said, obviously faking sympathy. “Seriously though, who the hell cares? Who you planning on texting in 1954?”</p><p>“You don’t get it,” Sam responded. “They took my 2010 phone, full of 2010 technology, meaning we could have a serious Back to the Future II situation.”</p><p>“What, so Biff is going to steal our Delorean?”</p><p>“No, we could seriously alter the timeline. Introduce things now that aren’t supposed to exist for decades—“</p><p>“Am I gonna have to kiss Mom?” Dean said, his smirk evident even over the phone.</p><p>“Dean.” Sam knew he had to break Dean out of his streak or he was going to be hearing Marty McFly jokes for the rest of the day. “Please.”</p><p>“Fine. Remember what Cass told me, though—whatever we do, that’s what happened. We can’t change history, we can just live in it for a bit. We break something, it was always broken, that’s how it was—always.”</p><p>“Cass told you that because he was trying to prove a point. Why would Don send us back if we couldn’t change anything?” Sam asked. “If the scroll really was destroyed in 1954, we are going to change that.”</p><p>“Well don’t count on the d-bag coming by to clarify any of it.”</p><p>“There’s something else,” Sam admitted. “Whoever broke in was thorough. Not just a smash and grab job.”</p><p>“So they were motivated. Had something particular in mind,” Dean said.</p><p>“Could someone have overheard us, someone else who wants the scroll?”</p><p>Dean exhaled loudly. “This is gonna be harder than I thought.”</p><p>“In 2010, the last thing I loaded on the phone was the Wikipedia page for the scrolls. Probably no one will ever be able to recover it. But what if they can? What if there is someone out there—“</p><p>“Who is a technological genius fifty years ahead of their time, and also cares about the scrolls? I don’t think so,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam was silent. He knew he had to tell Dean the rest of the story, but couldn’t face letting his brother down. Finally, he gulped down a breath and bit the bullet.</p><p>“There’s one more thing that’s missing. Ruby’s knife.”</p><p>“Damn it, Sam—“</p><p>“I know,” Sam replied, trying to head off Dean’s inevitable tirade.</p><p>“You left the knife in the apartment? What were you thinking? I thought I was supposed to be the dumbass?”</p><p>“I didn’t leave it. Someone must have taken it off of me.”</p><p>“What, so now we have ninjas after us?” Dean asked, exasperated.</p><p>“There was this girl, in the hallway...” Sam trailed off, letting Dean’s imagination fill in the rest.</p><p>“That’s just perfect. I mean, we’ve been porked before, but this takes the cake.” Dean took a breath. “Sammy? You there?”</p><p>“Yeah, Dean. I’m here.”</p><p>“With or without the knife, we gotta move forward,” Dean said, then added in an undertone. “This crate I saw, it had a bunch of markings on it, I think in Hebrew.”</p><p>“Sounds right.”</p><p>“My point is, if the package is in Hebrew, imagine what language the scroll itself will be in—“</p><p>“You’re just thinking of that now?” Sam chided. “According to the books I found, similar texts from that region and time period were written in early Herodian square script, but that’s more the symbology than the language. The language would be Aramaic.”</p><p>“Save it, Dan Brown. My point is, how are we gonna read this thing?”</p><p>“I’m working on it,” Sam said. “Let’s worry about finding the scroll first.”</p><p>“Good chat, Sam,” his brother responded, an edge in his voice. “I’ll try to track down the scroll before the Hamburglar catches up with me. Try not to lose your pants.”</p><p>“Wait,” Sam spat out, “when are we meeting up?”</p><p>“Meet me back here when my shift ends. Eight o’clock.”</p><p>Sam heard Dean hang up.</p><p>He stepped out of the phone booth and back into the swirling storm of people outside. I guess Dean can handle himself for a few hours, Sam thought, turning south, away from the Waldorf and back toward the library.</p><p>Two hours later, Sam was no closer to speaking Aramaic. Being in one of the biggest libraries in the world, the texts were certainly available, but the language was far more complex than Sam had imagined. Without help, it could take months to get an accurate translation.</p><p>I wonder if Bobby knows Aramaic? It wasn’t that crazy a notion, since a large portion of the biblical lore books that Bobby studied were in ancient languages. Not that we have Bobby here, Sam thought. For a brief moment, he considered looking up the Singers in the phone book. Bobby was born in the fifties; it was possible that at that very moment an infant Bobby was first learning to scowl.</p><p>Sam again wished that he had gotten more information from Don before being sent back. What were they supposed to do once they found the War Scroll? Translate it in the past, or hide it Bill &amp; Ted-style for their future selves to find?</p><p>The boys didn’t often get a chance to plan ahead, so when the opportunity presented itself, Sam decided he was going to take it. He found a phone book in the lobby and used his last ten cents to call the American Bible Society—apparently it was home to the greatest concentration of biblical texts outside of the Vatican. It was as good a place to start as any.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The benefits of Dean’s job were manifold. The women he helped to their rooms were uniformly stunning, from which Dean surmised that even in 1954, enough money could buy you beauty. They were also generous. The twenty dollars a week the manager had quoted turned out to be on the very low end. Dean had no idea how much his tips could actually buy, but he imagined it was a lot. He wondered if most people knew such arcane facts—had Dean been out hunting demons on the school day when the kids learned about inflation rates?</p><p>The most obvious benefit to the job was access, but that was also the downside. He was tantalizingly close to the scrolls, but he was now under the close supervision of the more dickish of the two desk clerks. After several hours of work, he still hadn’t been able to venture down to the vault.</p><p>His opportunity came shortly after sunset, when the clerk finally left the front desk. Dean pushed his luggage cart into the elevator and asked Rick to leave it on the top floor, hoping that nobody would come looking for him this time. Slipping into the employees-only corridor that led away from the ornate lobby, Dean marveled at how quickly the hotel went from world-class to low-class. Water stains ran down the cheap wallpaper, bringing to mind the Winchesters’ usual stomping grounds. While Dean enjoyed the change of pace that the Waldorf represented, the drab familiarity of the hallway helped put him in hunting mode.</p><p>Not taking a chance on the service elevator being in use, Dean took the back stairwell. Calling it dank would be an understatement. The bare-bulb lighting was hardly enough to see by, but probably helped cover up the unfortunate state of the stairs themselves.</p><p>Toward the base of the stairwell, he heard a low scraping noise and slowed his pace. It sounded like something was being dragged across unfinished cement.</p><p>“My God, I...” intoned a man’s voice, before fading to a murmur. Glass clinked against glass, followed by the sound of a bottle slowly pouring out its contents.</p><p>Dean padded down a few more steps and craned his head around the corner. He was glad, for once, that Sam wasn’t stomping his heavy feet beside him. There were advantages to being the less muscle-bound Winchester. Despite that, the stair he was perched on felt less than stable.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to do it,” the man said, his voice full of quiet desperation. “You know I would never...”</p><p>Leaning forward as he listened for a reply, Dean nearly slipped off the crumbling concrete step, and pieces of the slab skittered downward. The voice stopped and moments later Dean heard feet pounding away from him. Crap, he swore under his breath, the noise had clearly spooked the man enough to send him running.</p><p>Dean slammed his shoulder through the doorway into the sub-basement hallway, sending a radiating pain through his arm that probably wouldn’t go away for a week. The man hadn’t gotten far, having slipped to the ground less than ten feet from the stairwell.</p><p>“Whaddaya doin’, trying to... ugh,” the man said, gulping down air. “Trying to give me a coronary?”</p><p>“Slow your roll, dude,” Dean answered as he approached. The man’s face was flush and covered in sweat, and Dean recognized him immediately as the guard who had brought the War Scroll crate into the Waldorf earlier. He also recognized the bottle of Wild Turkey that was upended and dripping onto the cement floor. “Hard day, I take it,” he said, leaning in to read the man’s ID badge. “Mr. McMannon?”</p><p>The man shuddered back a sob and lifted the bottle to his lips to swill down what hadn’t spilled.</p><p>Dean inclined his head at the sorry sight. “Been there.”</p><p>Was it possible that this mess of a guy was responsible for guarding the vault? If so, it was just a matter of keeping him acquainted with that bottle. Dean had no qualms about robbing a passed-out drunk.</p><p>“Hasn’t been a great few days for me, either. Hell, hasn’t been a great decade,” he said.</p><p>Lumbering to his feet, McMannon gave Dean a wary look.</p><p>“Decade just—“ he began, then hiccupped, “started.” Clearly, the guard wasn’t ready for a heart-to-heart with an intrusive bellhop.</p><p>Dean gave him his best car salesman grin.</p><p>“How ‘bout I get us another bottle?”</p><p>James McMannon was in control of himself for the time being. He couldn’t exactly recall how he had come to be in the sub-basement, or even what day it was, but at least he felt in control.</p><p>He watched the bellhop scurry back up the stairs to get another bottle. Something about the man—was it his smell?—was unsettling. James briefly considered killing him when he returned, but quickly banished the thought. Why would I do that? Why would I even think it? It was then that the image popped back into his mind: his nephew, Barney, head hanging like a rag doll’s, his eyes totally lifeless.</p><p>Where had he seen that? Was it a terrible dream? Deep down, a part of James knew that he had done an unspeakable thing—but that part of his brain was currently drowning in Bourbon. At any rate, it wasn’t James that had killed Barney; it was the strange animal living inside him, and that animal seemed to be, for the moment, asleep.</p><p>He shook his head to banish the strange thoughts. Now where was that kid with the new bottle of whiskey?</p><p>Paranoia was deeply ingrained in the hunter lifestyle, and Sam Winchester had been checking for tails since he was five years old. Walking through the maelstrom of mid-town Manhattan was proving to be unimaginably difficult for him, especially with the knowledge that he’d been followed once that day already.</p><p>Double back, wait a few minutes, then keep moving, Sam repeated to himself over and over. It was his father’s mantra, and it was clearly designed for small town America, not the overflowing streets of New York City.</p><p>The towering brick building that housed the American Bible Society was located at 57^th^ Street and Park Avenue, a few blocks north of the Waldorf. Sam had resisted the temptation to check in on his brother while walking past, but he was still feeling the frustration of living without a cell phone. He imagined Dean had already made another attempt to get near the scroll, but it would be a few hours before his shift was over and Sam could find out for sure.</p><p>Sam’s contact was waiting for him in the Society’s front lobby. He was a well-built man stuffed into a suit that was too small for him. His thin necktie accentuated the unflattering fit. His arm was in a canvas sling, leading Sam to wonder what sort of trouble the man had gotten himself into.</p><p>“Mr. Sawyer?” Sam asked.</p><p>The man nodded and gestured toward a set of chairs.</p><p>“Please, call me Walter. Have a seat. Can I get you a drink?”</p><p>Before Sam could respond, Walter dropped ice cubes into two tumblers and poured amber liquid into each one.</p><p>“I regret I couldn’t be more helpful on the telephone,” Walter said as he handed Sam his drink. “I’m not sure I understand what you’re looking for.”</p><p>“I’m not sure either, not yet. I’m in the process of buying a religious relic, something of family interest—“</p><p>“You’re Jewish?” Walter interrupted with a slight squint.</p><p>“No, it’s not... not that, exactly.”</p><p>Walter knocked back his drink absently, his attention fully on Sam.</p><p>“But you mentioned something about Hebrew relics, Old Testament manuscripts.” He paused for a moment, his eyes asking the obvious question. “If you don’t mind my asking, what’s the ‘family interest’?”</p><p>“In-laws,” Sam said with a shrug.</p><p>The scholar seemed to accept that, for the moment.</p><p>“And once you have acquired the documents, you’ll need them interpreted.”</p><p>“Translated,” Sam corrected. “I think biblical interpretation is best left to the individual.”</p><p>Walter pulled a crooked half-grin. “Fair enough.” He brushed a lock of his unkempt brown hair from his forehead. “Does this have something to do with the Dead Sea Scrolls?”</p><p>Sam was careful to keep his face neutral. “What do you know about the scrolls?” he asked.</p><p>“They’re the most important historical discovery of the century,” Walter said with precise, almost rehearsed diction, as if he had said it many times, to many people. “Any century, really. Though whether people accept that is a different matter entirely.”</p><p>“It’s not the first apocryphal Old Testament text,” Sam replied, studying Walter’s reaction.</p><p>“Apocryphal. What makes it any less relevant than Genesis or Revelations? Or Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, for that matter?” Walter spat with thinly veiled distaste.</p><p>“Have you read them? The scrolls?”</p><p>Walter didn’t respond immediately, instead he looked into Sam’s eyes as if he was passing judgment, determining whether he was worthy of sharing what he knew of the scrolls.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Sam forced a smile and took a sip from his very strong drink. Straight whiskey, he realized. At least it was afternoon. As he set the glass on the nearby end table, he noticed a red blot seeping across Walter’s canvas sling.</p><p>“Your arm alright?” he asked, indicating the bloody stain.</p><p>Walter glanced at it carelessly. “Ah. I should really be more careful on the subway,” he said, and stood up. “Let’s go to my office and talk about the scrolls.”</p><p>The sub-basement of the Waldorf Astoria was spinning around Dean Winchester. His head was rested against the cushion of a tall-back chair, his feet propped up on the security desk outside the hotel’s vault. His sobriety was long since gone.</p><p>“You think you’ve had a crap week, let me tell you something, James,” Dean said, gesturing wildly with an almost-empty bottle of vodka, the only liquor he had managed to swipe from the bar upstairs. “I come from... the future.”</p><p>For his part, James wasn’t listening to a word of Dean’s rant. He was far more than three sheets to the wind, his pudgy cheeks and eyes were both red, his eyelids drooping with exhaustion.</p><p>“The friggin’ future, man.”</p><p>James studied his hands intently, as if they were part of somebody else’s body.</p><p>“We have this thing, the internet, it’s like porno city. Anything you want. What are you into, man? Asians? They’ve got Asians,” Dean said with a knowing look. Boy did they have Asians.</p><p>James’s head drooped toward the floor. Dean, realizing that this was his moment, shut up and watched for any sign that James would snap out of it. Instead, he dropped to the floor entirely, his girth hitting the concrete with a slap.</p><p>“Gonna feel that tomorrow,” Dean said as he moved toward the vault door. In his inebriated state, he stumbled over James’s legs and nearly face-planted himself.</p><p>The vault was like that of a small bank, with a heavy combination-locked door which no doubt lead into a room full of safety deposit boxes. Dean knew that breaking into the main vault would be relatively straightforward—after all, he had a bit of experience in that regard—but finding the War Scroll inside might prove trickier. He’d seen James bringing the large crate in earlier, but he had no idea how big the scroll itself was, or whether it had been filed into an individually locked safety deposit box.</p><p>As he listened to the tumblers on the main door click into place, he heard James twitch on the floor. Poor bastard, Dean thought, seems like he’s got enough problems as it is. This ain’t gonnahelp. Not that Dean knew what James’s problem was, since he hadn’t been particularly chatty during their marathon drinking session.</p><p>After a few minutes, the heavy door swung open. All of Dean’s fears about finding the scroll were immediately relieved, as the center of the vault was filled with several large jars. They looked to be thousands of years old, and each was capped with a lid inscribed with symbols. Dean moved quickly toward them. He lifted the lid off the nearest jar, to find, to his surprise, a shape was carved onto the inside of the lid—a rudimentary Devil’s Trap. The holy symbol that could contain a demon.</p><p>Before Dean could react, a throaty growl sounded behind him.</p><p>James McMannon stood outside the vault, totally sober, his eyes jet black. While Dean took a heartbeat to consider how totally screwed he was, James charged.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Despite his considerable heft, James’s possessed body moved with the speed and lightness of a man half his weight. His meaty hand grasped Dean’s neck as he slid him off his feet and up against the wall of the vault. Dean’s feet strained for the solid floor, his toes dangling inches above the cement.</p><p>James looked at Dean with a discerning eye, as though he had just discovered a brand-new species of insect. He rolled Dean’s head from side to side as Dean gasped for breath.</p><p>“Listen buddy,” Dean managed to choke out. “I know you’re super glad to get into a new meatsuit—though frankly you could have picked someone in better shape. How ‘bout you leave the poor shmuck alone?”</p><p>James brought Dean’s face close to his own and sniffed him.</p><p>“Whoa, guy, I’m not into the kinky stuff,” Dean squawked, noticing the wild look in the man’s eyes. “This is a little too Mutual of Omaha’s Wild Kingdom for me. How about you let me go?”</p><p>With a swoop of his arm, James threw Dean clear out of the vault. He sailed over the ramshackle table outside and hit the concrete wall, head first. He slumped to the ground, consciousness fading quickly. The last thing Dean heard before blackness took him was a howling, ferocious bark.</p><p>When Dean woke up, the asshole desk clerk was looming above him. Dean turned his head with difficulty. He noticed the vault was closed and James McMannon was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Dean lifted his arm to the desk clerk. “Can I get a little help?”</p><p>“You’re fired. Return your uniform and get out.”</p><p>Dean managed to lift himself up on one elbow.</p><p>“You mean I don’t get to keep this cute little hat?”</p><p>The desk clerk sneered, turned, and walked away.</p><p>Dean felt the goose egg on the back of his skull. So much for working from the inside.</p><p>As he got to his feet, Dean had to brace himself against the wall. He stumbled a little—he hadn’t been unconscious quite long enough for all that vodka to metabolize.</p><p>After returning his bellhop monkey suit, Dean stumbled out onto the dark sidewalk. The sun had set, but when? How long had he been out? His watch had stopped when he came to in 1954, and he hadn’t managed to get it going again. He looked both ways, trying to figure out which direction the apartment was. Then he heard the quick clip of shoes on the sidewalk. Two NYPD officers were quickly approaching him, and that couldn’t be good news. Dean spun on his heels and tried to cross the street, but the officers quickly grasped both his arms.</p><p>“Had a little too much to drink did you, guy?”</p><p>Dean looked at them, a tad bleary-eyed.</p><p>“Not at all officers. I just woke up. Had the most wonderful night with Marilyn Monroe. She’s a hell cat.”</p><p>“We should let DiMaggio have a bat at your face for that one,” said one of the officers, as the other hailed a paddy wagon.</p><p>When it arrived, they shoved Dean roughly into the back of the vehicle and sped away.</p><p>By the time Sam got to the police station, Dean had been sitting in a cell for a couple of hours. The station chief led Sam down into the holding cells beneath the old building, where he discovered his brother sitting contently on a clean bunk drinking coffee and playing poker with his cell mate, a guy in a rumpled suit who looked like his three-martini lunch had got out of hand. Dean jumped up when he saw Sam.</p><p>“You have ten bucks on you?”</p><p>“Dean, I can’t use any of my money. It’s useless.”</p><p>“Exactly, so give me a ten,” Dean whispered, indicating the guy behind him.</p><p>Sam dug in his pockets and pulled out a bill. Dean took it and threw it down on the ground between the cots.</p><p>“I’ll see your five and I’ll raise you five,” Dean said. He then sat back against the wall.</p><p>“Too rich for my blood,” the guy said.</p><p>“Guess the pot is mine then.” Dean pulled a pile of change and bills toward him. “Thanks for a good game.”</p><p>The guard unlocked the door.</p><p>“Thanks Joe, keep up the good work.” Dean smiled at Sam as he held up his winnings in 1954 dollar bills.</p><p>The boys made their way out of the station.</p><p>“Nice going with staying under the radar, Dean.”</p><p>“I didn’t have a choice. I was this close to nabbing the scroll. And news flash! McTubby the guard wasn’t any regular guard. He was possessed by a demon, and now he’s on the loose. And it really doesn’t help that you lost Ruby’s knife.”</p><p>They stepped out onto the street.</p><p>“Wait, what do you mean he was possessed?”</p><p>“You know, black eyes, super-human strength, the whole shebang, right here in 1954.”</p><p>“What did he want?”</p><p>“To eat my liver? How should I know?”</p><p>“Well, did he say anything?”</p><p>Dean paused, trying to remember. “He didn’t so much talk, as... bark.”</p><p>“What, like a dog?” Sam asked, amused. When Dean’s facial expression remained stony, he realized it wasn’t a joke. “Wait, really? Like, a demon guard dog?”</p><p>“Half dog, half man? Sort of a man-dog. More dog than man. Whatever. It doesn’t matter. The most important thing right now is staying out of its way long enough to get the scroll. Getting back to 2010 alive would be a nice perk.”</p><p>By the time the Winchester brothers made it back to their small apartment, it was almost three in the morning. They spent half an hour comparing notes and going over the events of the last twenty-four hours. Sam told Dean everything he had learned at the library and from Walter, minus the information about Abaddon.</p><p>Given all they had discovered, the boys were now faced with a couple of problems. Though they knew when the transaction was going to take place, they didn’t know who the actual buyer of the scrolls would be. They knew that a banker had been involved in the sale, but it would take some legwork to find out who that was. Even if they did find him, it would be much easier to take the scrolls before the actual transaction, rather than trying to grab them at the Waldorf Astoria, especially now that Dean had lost his job. They also had no weapons, and no idea how to contact Don once they actually had the War Scroll.</p><p>The one mercy granted them that night came from an unexpected source. Their next-door neighbors had been going at it with some vigor the whole night, to the point that the wall was shaking. At the height of the banging, a Murphy wall bed sprang loose from the wall where it had been hidden from view.</p><p>“The good news,” Sam said, “is that the thief didn’t find it either.” He then claimed the bed and was asleep in minutes.</p><p>Dean lay on the worn couch. Feels like I haven’t slept in years. His thoughts drifted to the leggy brunette in the lobby of the Waldorf Astoria. In 2010, it wasn’t unusual to see a woman traveling by herself; in 1954 it was another story. He wondered who she was and where she had come from. There was something about how she carried herself. He was drawn to her confident walk and the way she had looked right at him—almost into him. Dean thought that after hunting down the demon-possessed guard, he might hang around and try to run into her again. He fell asleep trying to craft an opening line that would be suitable for the era.</p><p>In the morning, Sam and Dean sat on the steps of the New York Public Library sipping cups of coffee. Dean couldn’t believe coffee was just five cents, and a whole pizza was seventy-five cents. It was like living in food paradise.</p><p>They discussed what their next move was. They decided that Sam would send a telegram to the address on the Wall Street Journal classified ad, saying that he was interested in buying the scrolls.</p><p>Dean wanted to go back to the Waldorf and find James— it couldn’t be a coincidence that demon was hanging around the site of the upcoming auction. But before returning to the hotel, he headed to a secondhand store determined to buy a suit, after which he planned to get a close shave. If he was going back to the Waldorf as a civilian, he didn’t want to look out of place.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam found a Western Union and sent a telegram to the party selling the scrolls.</p><p>INTERESTED IN BIBLICAL SCROLLS SEEN IN CLSFD AD IN WSJ STOP HAVE FUNDS STOP SERIOUS BUYER STOP PLEASE RESPOND QUICKLY STOP SINGER</p><p>In fact, they didn’t have any funds, but Sam was going to cross that bridge when he came to it. He thought the little hat tip to Bobby was appropriate, and he wished more than ever that Bobby was there to help them.</p><p>Sam told the clerk where he could be reached, and said he would stop back in an hour to see if there was a response. He then made his way to Gimbels.</p><p>Browsing the men’s section, Sam found a wool suit for twenty-eight dollars. He had the money—Dean’s tips and his poker game in the holding cell had netted them about a hundred bucks—and Sam decided the suit was worth it. He wore it out of the store, his regular 2010 clothes stuffed into the Gimbels bag.</p><p>Sam noticed a barber shop right outside the department store. Only “a little off the top”, turned out to be about four inches. Sam stared at himself in the shop’s mirror. Now that is different, he thought. The barber smoothed his hair back with a little Murray’s Pomade and he was ready to go.</p><p>When he stopped back at the Western Union, a telegram was waiting for him.</p><p>SINGER STOP WILL CONSIDER GENEROUS OFFER STOP MEET AT 21 CLUB AT 11 AM STOP ASK FOR FELDMAN</p><p>Sam looked up and saw a clock on the outside wall of a nearby a bank; it was 10:30 a.m. He asked a passerby for directions, and then started north up Sixth Avenue; he would get there right on time.</p><p>At the 21 Club, Sam admired the lawn jockeys mounted on the porch roof of the street level restaurant below. He had never been here before. Whenever the brothers had been in New York, it had always been on a hunt. They had never really got to enjoy the culture of the city.</p><p>Sam entered the dark restaurant. Red leather booths ringed the room and every inch of it was strung, hung or hugged with a toy of some sort. A maître-d’ ushered Sam to a table where a young man in a dark-brown suit was already sitting, Sam was sure he couldn’t be a day over twenty-five. He wondered how this kid could possibly be in the business of selling ancient biblical texts.</p><p>“Mr. Feldman?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No, I’m his attaché, Mr. Benjamin Shochat.” The man stood up and shook Sam’s outstretched hand. “I speak on Mr. Feldman’s behalf. You’re Mr. Singer, I presume?” The man had a lilting accent that sounded Middle Eastern.</p><p>“Yes. Good to meet you,” Sam replied. He sat down and motioned for the waiter to bring him a glass of water. “I’m interested in the scrolls and I’d like to bid on them, but I want to see them first.” Sam had clocked that the man was empty handed when he walked up to the table. If he could convince Shochat to take him to the Waldorf and show him the scrolls, he was in business.</p><p>Mr. Shochat studied Sam’s face. “You are working for someone, yes?”</p><p>“I’m not at liberty to say just yet,” Sam improvised smoothly. “But if I was speaking on behalf of someone else, it would be a very serious buyer with a large amount of capital. This person would like me to examine the merchandise first, however.”</p><p>“Not possible,” the young man responded with a snort. “They are being kept in a vault, under heavy security.”</p><p>“At the Waldorf Astoria,” Sam said with a smile, metaphorically laying his cards on the table.</p><p>“How do you know that?” Shochat was clearly ruffled and trying not to show it.</p><p>“I know things. I’d like to see the scrolls.”</p><p>“How do I know you have sufficient funds?”</p><p>Sam stood up. “I think I’ve already proven how serious I am Mr. Shochat. Kindly have Mr. Feldman contact me if he wants to do business.”</p><p>Shochat was looking increasingly nervous. It was clear he was in over his head, and was afraid that if he didn’t act carefully, he was going to let a big fish go.</p><p>“Okay, wait,” he said hastily. “Please sit.” He drank a little from his water glass. “Mr. Feldman has another interested party, and they’ve made an initial offer of 100,000 US dollars. Are you willing to go higher?”</p><p>Sam realized that since he didn’t actually have any money at all, he could say anything he liked. He sat back down at the table.</p><p>“If the scrolls are genuine, twice that price would be a bargain,” he said blithely.</p><p>Shochat leaned back in his chair, clearly impressed. Then Sam remembered that in an era of twenty-eight-dollar suits and seventy-five-cent large pizzas, 200,000 dollars was an enormous amount of money. He waited while Shochat thought it over. I just need an invite to the auction, that’s all. He and Dean could do the rest themselves.</p><p>“I’ll get back to you,” Shochat said at last and stood up. “I’ll speak with Mr. Feldman. I can’t negotiate for him.”</p><p>“Fine,” Sam said standing up as well.</p><p>The young man set a derby on his head, tipped it in Sam’s direction, and left.</p><p>Dean stretched comfortably in the large leather barber’s chair. He was impressed by the incredibly close shave he’d been given. Why did men ever give these up? he wondered.</p><p>He had bought a secondhand dark-colored suit, a white shirt, and a black derby. Dean had never been a hat guy, per se, but he liked the feel of the derby. He wondered if he could conceal a weapon of some kind in it.</p><p>Out on the street, close shaven and besuited, he felt completely incognito. Now he could slip around the hotel unnoticed, giving him another chance at the scrolls.</p><p>A few minutes later, Dean stepped into the opulent lobby of the Waldorf Astoria. No alarms went off. Disguise is working, I guess, he mused. Using a key set he had neglected to return the day before, he accessed the back stairwell. Slipping quietly into the sub-basement, he immediately realized his plan wouldn’t work.</p><p>Apparently, someone had taken his intrusion yesterday very seriously—there were now three guards waiting outside the vault, and all of them were armed. Before they noticed him, Dean slipped through a half-open door to his left.</p><p>He found himself inside a dank supply closet, containing a single metal chair with a man slumped in it, his back to Dean. Cautiously, Dean moved toward him.</p><p>It’s James the security guard, he realized. Fast asleep—Wait, do demons sleep? Since he wasn’t carrying any weapons, he decided to let the sleeping dog lie. Then he caught sight of the burlap sack in the corner and remembered a handy factoid: During the nasty New York winters, janitors used salt to melt ice on the sidewalks in front of important buildings like the Waldorf Astoria. And it looked like the hotel’s salt supply was stored in this very cupboard.</p><p>Dean ripped open the corner of a bag and emptied half of it. He’d need to move fast if this was going to work. He hefted the sack in his arms.</p><p>“What the St. Mary are you doin’?” James asked, suddenly awake and wiping saliva from the side of his mouth.</p><p>Dean hesitated, the bag of salt raised above the guard’s head. Making a quick decision, he lowered the bag to his side.</p><p>Neither man spoke for several seconds, then Dean cleared his throat.</p><p>“Getting salt,” he said.</p><p>James rubbed his eyes, which were a normal greeny-blue color.</p><p>No sign of demonic possession. Nevertheless, Dean knew that the demon could still be inside James, biding its time.</p><p>“Do you remember me?” Dean asked.</p><p>James leaned forward in the chair, running his hands through his short hair.</p><p>“No, buddy. Why would I?”</p><p>Looks like he has the world’s worst hangover, Dean thought. Oddly, he felt some sympathy for the man.</p><p>“It’s nothing. Thought maybe you went to my church,” he said.</p><p>James looked up at Dean, his face blotched and red.</p><p>“Take your salt and leave me alone,” he said, without a hint of recognition on his face.</p><p>He really doesn’t recognize me, Dean thought. Maybe Cujo’s moved on? He did as he was told, hefting the bag of salt and starting toward the door. He considered ‘accidentally’ dropping the sack into James’s lap as he walked past, but he controlled the impulse. There were three guards outside the door, each one capable of putting a bullet in Dean if they realized he was back at the Waldorf.</p><p>Slipping back into the stairwell, Dean dumped the sack of salt and considered the situation. If James was still possessed, it was one of the strangest demons Dean had ever encountered. The hosts usually retained the memories of the demon, and vice-versa. Maybe it’s not a demon at all. Maybe it’s something else—that could explain the barking.</p><p>Back in the lobby, Dean crossed to one of the bars. He ordered a Seven and Seven and sank into a deep red-velvet club chair.</p><p>“May I join you?”</p><p>Dean looked up. The girl from the day before stood in front of him. She was dressed in a slim burgundy suit, with a skirt that stopped just below her knees. Not waiting for an answer, she sat down opposite him.</p><p>“So, one day you’re a bellhop, the next you’re at the bar as a guest. That’s peculiar,” she said, looking him over. Her eyes seemed to tick off each article of clothing Dean was wearing, as well as taking note of his features.</p><p>He leaned forward. “It’s also peculiar that you noticed,” he said.</p><p>The girl smiled, but didn’t blush.</p><p>“How could I forget? It’s not often a man offers to buy me a drink within thirty seconds of meeting me.”</p><p>“Give it a little time. When the sixties hit, girls like you will be—“ Dean stopped himself. Why ruin the swinging sixties for her? “Anyway, I apologize for being so forward. It’s not like me at all.”</p><p>“You’re already lying to me? That’s not a great sign.”</p><p>“Okay, it is exactly like me,” Dean said, leaning back in his chair.</p><p>“It’s okay, it’s refreshing. It means you’re not that complicated.”</p><p>“Is that supposed to be a compliment?”</p><p>The girl laughed. “Sort of.”</p><p>Dean lied again. “I didn’t catch your name yesterday.”</p><p>“Julia. Julia Wilder.”</p><p>She held out her petite gloved hand and Dean shook it politely, grinning at the strange formality of the gesture.</p><p>For half a second, he almost told her his real name. “I’m Malcolm. Malcolm Young,” he said instead. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>“You didn’t answer my question, Malcolm. How are you a bellhop one day and a guest the next?”</p><p>“Big promotion,” Dean said carelessly.</p><p>She beckoned over the bartender.</p><p>“Scotch, please. One ice cube,” she instructed.</p><p>Dean raised a brow. That was a stiff drink for such a small woman. As though she could read his thoughts, Julia leaned forward.</p><p>“My father and I have lived all over the world. I’m very adept at drinking liquor. It’s unusual for a woman, I know.”</p><p>Dean smiled. “I was actually going to say impressive.”</p><p>“So Malcolm Young, tell me about yourself.”</p><p>“Not much to tell, really. I’m in New York on business with my brother.”</p><p>“What kind of business are you in? Besides carting bags, that is.”</p><p>Dean adjusted his secondhand suit jacket.</p><p>“Family business. Extermination. I was in the bellhop outfit so I could explore the hotel without alerting the guests.”</p><p>“Are you saying there are bugs in the Waldorf Astoria?”</p><p>“You didn’t hear it from me.” Dean raised his glass. “To being bug free.”</p><p>Julia Wilder clinked his glass, then, with a lady-like swig, emptied hers. She stood up and smoothed her skirt.</p><p>“Very nice meeting you, Mr. Young. Again.”</p><p>“You’re leaving?”</p><p>“I have an appointment. Are you going to be in the city much longer?”</p><p>“We’re waiting for a bid, then we go home,” Dean said. It wasn’t a total lie.</p><p>“Perhaps I’ll see you again.” She smiled and then walked across the lobby to the guest elevators.</p><p>Dean watched her and sighed. Why do all the cool girls live in the past?</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam stopped by the Western Union, and found another telegram from Mr. Feldman was waiting for him.</p><p>JULY 1^ST^ NOON PRESIDENTIAL SUITE WALDORF ASTORIA</p><p>Sam had done it, he had gotten them an invite to the auction. Now the challenge was getting hold of the scroll itself. Could get dangerous, especially if Dean is the one who comes up with the plan.</p><p>The obvious next step—they needed guns. Their usual contacts in New York were for the most part not even born yet, so Sam had to come up with an alternate solution. He decided to make his way to Little Italy. Thanks to his older brother, Sam had seen all the Godfather films dozens of times, and figured it couldn’t all be fictional. After all, Mario Puzo knows what he’s talking about.</p><p>Leaving Canal Street Station, Sam aimed for some of the smaller side streets of Little Italy. Ten minutes later, he stood in front of a restaurant with a CLOSED sign in the window. Inside, he could see several middle-aged men sat talking around a large table. A similarly weathered-looking man sat out front, picking grape seeds from between his teeth.</p><p>“Hi,” Sam began hesitantly. “I was hoping to speak to someone, about a... business arrangement.” Now that he was standing in front of what could be a real Mafioso, he had no idea what to say.</p><p>“Members only,” the man said looking up. Sam noticed that one of his eyes was swollen shut.</p><p>“That’s quite a shiner,” he commented.</p><p>“Look kid, move along if you know what’s good for ya.”</p><p>Normally, Sam wasn’t one to cause a scene. In this case, with the weight of the world resting on his shoulders, he was willing to break with tradition. He took a deep breath and plunged in.</p><p>“Listen, guy, I don’t have time for subtlety. I need guns. Lots of guns.” Sam pulled his remaining dollar bills from his pocket and waved the wad at the guy. “I’m willing to pay—“</p><p>“Whoa. Put that away.” The guy looked both ways along the street. He got up and pushed Sam roughly inside the foyer and against the wall and frisked him. Sam stood completely still. He knew better than to wiggle around when a Goodfella was getting handsy.</p><p>“Up there, second floor.”</p><p>Sam thanked him and headed for the stairs, passing the small cluster of guys who it turned out were playing a poker game in the main room—he made a mental note to tell Dean, in case they needed to replenish their cash reserves.</p><p>A small man, about forty years old and wearing a cable-knit sweater, sat at a desk on the second floor landing. Two bigger guys stood by the wall, their hands clasped in front of them. They were clearly packing some sort of weapon.</p><p>Sam cleared his throat and explained what he needed: two shotguns, two handguns, and no questions.</p><p>The transaction went very smoothly, all things considered. In the end Sam was only able to afford the two shotguns and ammunition, but within a few minutes he was holding a packed duffel and surrendering the last of his cash.</p><p>As he was preparing to leave, Sam hesitated.</p><p>“Um, actually,” he began. “I don’t know how I’m going to get these back uptown. See, I gave you all my money, and—“</p><p>“Bambi will drive you,” the cable-knit guy said. He motioned to the slightly bigger of the two men near the wall. Bambi nodded.</p><p>A black 1953 Cadillac idled in the back alley. Bambi held open the trunk while Sam dropped the duffel inside. Then Sam reached to open the back door of the car.</p><p>“Upfront,” Bambi ordered. “I ain’t a chauvinist.”</p><p>Sam was pretty sure he meant ‘chauffeur,’ but regardless, he did as he was told, and they were on their way. As they cruised up 5^th^ Avenue, Sam stole a couple of glances at his driver. His mouth looked like it had been cut with a meat cleaver, with pock-marked skin that hung in indefinite wrinkles down his face.</p><p>Sam attempted small talk. “So, why do they call you Bambi?”</p><p>“‘Cause of my doe eyes,” Bambi growled and looked at Sam with big droopy, brown eyes. They would have been adorable, if they weren’t filled with murder.</p><p>“Ahh.” Sam realized he was in a car with a complete sociopath. Give him a demon any day.</p><p>When they reached the apartment, Sam pulled the duffel bag from the trunk and said goodbye to Bambi. The car departed at speed.</p><p>Sam carefully stashed the shotguns in the small apartment, and smiled to himself, pleased with his hiding place. He then decided to see if Dean had made any progress at the Waldorf.</p><p>When he arrived at the hotel, he immediately spotted Dean. He was sat at the bar, chatting to the bartender, who clearly thought he was a lunatic.</p><p>“Aww, he’s great,” Dean slurred. “When they play ‘Stairway to Heaven’ he goes like, da dah daaaah.” Dean mimicked an air guitar. “You’re going to love them. Led Zeppelin—look out for them.”</p><p>Sam tapped his brother on the shoulder. Dean turned toward him, bleary-eyed. “Hey bro. How ya doing?”</p><p>“Dean, we’re in the middle of a job. What are you doing?”</p><p>“We’re in the middle of the century! Sit down, have a drink.”</p><p>“Not now Dean. Come on man, let’s go home.”</p><p>Dean scowled and slid off his seat. “Okay, fine.”</p><p>Dean stumbled away from the bar with Sam holding his arm. Then he looked at his brother, suddenly dead sober.</p><p>“What took you so long? I’ve been playing drunk for hours. That girl over there to the left—I had a drink with her. She said she had an appointment and she’s been lurking around the lobby ever since.”</p><p>Sam looked around, but he couldn’t see any girl. He wasn’t entirely sure that Dean was just playing drunk.</p><p>“Sam, I think she’s here for the auction. For the first hour, I just thought it was my animal magnetism, but I’m starting to think she’s onto us.”</p><p>“You don’t say,” Sam replied, pulling Dean along by the arm. “By the way,” he said, “I haven’t been sitting around wasting time at a bar. I scored us an invite to the scrolls auction, and the hardware we need to pull it off. Three days from now. Noon. Here.”</p><p>As the brothers walked out the door, the girl who called herself Julia Wilder followed close behind. She was now wearing a blonde wig and a light-green suit. It was the best disguise she could put together from her suitcase upstairs. Now that she had confirmed that the two young men were working together, she allowed them to escape from her sight and made her way to the lobby phones.</p><p>“Columbia 367,” she directed. After several seconds, a voice answered the phone. “Hi. It’s me. You were right, they’re together. Definitely casing the place.”</p><p>As the other party spoke into her ear, Julia’s face fell.</p><p>“No, I know. They won’t. I won’t let them,” she said.</p><p>With that, she hung up and went back to her room.</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In Dean’s pretty extensive life experience, there really wasn’t very much that could compare to a good bacon cheeseburger. Despite that, the hot dog—with everything—that he devoured as he and Sam marched back to their apartment came close.</p><p>Sam was decidedly less enthusiastic about their dinner.</p><p>“Nothing like mystery meat you bought from a guy wearing a skirt,” he said distastefully, swallowing the last of the bun and flicking ketchup off his fingers onto the sidewalk.</p><p>The sun had set behind the towering buildings, casting long inky shadows over the boys’ route. But as the city fell into darkness, it seemed to be coming alive.</p><p>“Can you imagine the kind of supernatural critters that must be running around these alleys?” Dean asked as they passed a particularly decrepit-looking apartment complex.</p><p>“Dad’s journal had a lot on New York,” Sam replied. “Wouldn’t be surprising if there were other hunters working the city—we know there are in the future,” he said thinking of General Cox. Sam gave his brother a cautious look, as if he was worried Dean wouldn’t like what he was going to say next. “It might be something to consider if we need backup.”</p><p>“Backup schmackup,” Dean responded. “What do we need other hunters for? We’ve got guns. Plus, you think we’d be able to convince anyone to help us once we start talking about the Apocalypse... and coming from the future?”</p><p>“Guess you’re right.”</p><p>“Damn straight. We tell anybody what we’re doing here, we risk them interfering,” Dean said definitively, knowing that interference may well be the least of their troubles. That certain people—and/or forces of Hell—would kill or worse in order to stop Sam and Dean was left unspoken. They both knew it, so it bore no repeating.</p><p>They walked up the cracked steps of Villard House. The sound of an ancient television set echoed out of the landlady’s open door as they passed by.</p><p>“Lady’s watching the DuMont Network in there,” Dean said with a grin.</p><p>“The what?” Sam asked, his brow furrowed.</p><p>Dean just stared at him, incredulous. He sometimes forgot how young Sam was. Not that Dean himself had been alive to watch the DuMont Network, which, in 1954, was due to be shut down in two years, but he watched enough TV to be familiar with its history.</p><p>“Cavalcade of Stars? The Honeymooners? Not ringing a bell? Seriously?”</p><p>“Do you watch those shows before or after Dr. Sexy, M.D.?” Sam asked, derisively.</p><p>“I’m off Dr. Sexy,” Dean said.</p><p>“Tell me again about the girl,” Sam said, his voice serious.</p><p>“Julia.”</p><p>“She was tailing you?”</p><p>Dean slipped the key into the door of their apartment.</p><p>“She was definitely interested,” he replied.</p><p>“Becky Rosen interested, or demon Meg interested?” Sam probed.</p><p>“Listen buddy, both of those chiquitas were after you,” Dean said, trying to keep the vision of Becky rubbing Sam’s chest out of his mind. “So, where are they?” Dean looked around the room. “You lose the guns just like you lost the knife?”</p><p>“Dean, it was stolen,” Sam retorted. Then, realization dawned on him. “... By a girl. Brunette, cute, about five-foot six?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Could be the same girl that brushed past me in the hall,” Sam continued. “Right before I realized the knife was gone.” He walked to the Murphy bed, pulled it down, and extracted the gun-filled duffel from the bed’s cavity. “As for these, they’re safe and sound.”</p><p>Dean watched Sam wistfully. The kid really has become a good hunter, despite everything, he thought. He grabbed the weapon-laden bag and opened it.</p><p>“Fifties women, dude,” he said as he appraised the contents. “It’s like a big riddle, and Betty Draper is the... thing you get for solving a riddle.”</p><p>“Wait, are you still into the girl who you know is on to you? We got robbed already, Dean. We don’t have time for you to get played.”</p><p>“Don’t start. I know. I’m not hitting on anything that was born before the microwave.” Dean hefted one of the shotguns, and expertly tilted the weight of it back and forth to feel its balance.</p><p>“I was thinking...” Sam began, then trailed off.</p><p>“Spit it out, big guy,” Dean said. “Thinking about taking a crap? Thinking of getting us some toothpaste? ‘Cause your breath is ripe.”</p><p>“If this wasn’t 1954, we’d be loading these with salt, right?” Sam asked, grabbing a few of the shotgun shells. “But here, we’re not. Because we’re not just fighting demons and ghosts and things that go bump; we’re robbing humans. Humans who didn’t do anything to us, or to anyone, didn’t do anything wrong, and we’re going to hold guns to their heads? Doesn’t it faze you even a little to be the bad guys?”</p><p>“We ice Lucifer, nobody’s crying over a little bit of armed larceny,” Dean retorted.</p><p>“So the end justifies the means?” Sam paused. “‘Cause it sure didn’t when it meant me juicing up on demon blood.”</p><p>Sam’s words drilled into Dean.</p><p>“That was different,” he growled.</p><p>Sam shook his head and started to pace the room, the creaky floorboards giving slightly under his weight.</p><p>Dean looked at his brother impatiently. Why does he always have to make things so complicated?</p><p>“It was different,” Dean persisted. “Look, I’m willing to go pretty damned far to get this stupid scroll. Whether that includes killing or maiming some poor bastard who gets in our way, I’m not sure yet. Won’t know that till my finger’s on the trigger. But Sammy, I sure as hell am not willing to lose my little brother.” Dean let out a sigh. “Saving you is the reason we’re here.”</p><p>But Sam’s face was resolved.</p><p>“Nobody else gets hurt,” he said. It wasn’t a statement, it was a command. “I have enough blood on me already.”</p><p>Dean reached into his pocket, felt the wad of bills, and started toward the door.</p><p>“Where are you going?” his brother demanded.</p><p>“To buy salt,” Dean responded, and the door shut on him.</p><p>James McMannon stood on the threshold of his sister’s brownstone house, bathed in the flashing red and blue of a police cruiser’s revolving lights. Peering through the open curtains, he saw his sister. Maria’s face was blotted with tears, her left cheek pressed into the thick of an older man’s shoulder. Maybe a neighbor, James thought, not recognizing the man. At least she has someone. If he went inside, they’d ask him to explain something that couldn’t be rationally explained, to tell a story that no sane person would believe.</p><p>Two uniformed officers were visible as well, both of them wearing the forlorn grimace of men sharing bad tidings. Your son is dead, they’re saying. We found his body. James didn’t need to read their lips, all he had to see was his sister’s anguished face.</p><p>The sight drove James off the stoop and back onto the narrow sidewalk. He began to shamble slowly northward.</p><p>Over the course of the evening, he had managed to piece together his shattered memories of what had happened to Barney—what he had done to Barney. He had never felt particularly in control of the direction his life was taking, but this was something different entirely. For a good chunk of the past few days, James hadn’t been in control of his hands, his feet, or anything in between. Now he felt like a stranger in his own body, just stopping by until the next occupant moved in. Every few hours, he would simply wake up in a new place, unsure of how he had got there. The memories might eventually return, or they might not. Only one had stuck—</p><p>I killed Barney. And people are going to be looking for me. New York was a city with a million small, dim corners to hide in, and his only option was to find one of them and disappear into it. My sister’s son, he thought, the words burning into his psyche. The only person she had left. Facing her was not an option. He had to vanish.</p><p>However, as the swirling light from the police cruiser faded into the distance, James found himself doing something peculiar. He was walking back toward Manhattan, toward the first place people would be looking for him—the Waldorf Astoria. A nagging voice in the back of his mind insisted that everything could be worked out, if only he was back at the hotel.</p><p>If only he was near the vault.</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam left the apartment before the sun had crept above the skyline, knowing it would be hours before Dean woke on his own. They weren’t accustomed to staying in one place for this long, and with the auction still two days away, there wasn’t a particular need to roll out of bed early. For Dean, that was an overdue invitation to get more than four hours sleep. For Sam, it was an excuse to get some time to himself.</p><p>Dean had indeed bought salt for the shotguns, but he had stayed out nearly the whole night finding it. Sam didn’t want to know how Dean had spent the rest of his time, considering Dean’s tendency to fraternize with less-than-virtuous characters. I suppose I’m one of them, Sam realized. Nothing less virtuous than jump-starting Armageddon.</p><p>After a twenty-minute walk, Sam arrived at the clerk’s office for the borough of Manhattan. It was just before eight in the morning, but there was already a line forming at the information desk. A young woman, probably twenty years old and wearing a slightly too-tight sweater, stood behind the desk.</p><p>By the time it was Sam’s turn, she was starting to sound frazzled.</p><p>“Can I help you, sir?” she asked, the tone of her voice indicating that she hoped she couldn’t.</p><p>“Long morning already?” Sam responded with a smile, thinking that charm would be the best way to pull this off.</p><p>“No, sir. Did you have a records request, or is this a social visit?” she said tersely.</p><p>Sam was momentarily thrown.</p><p>“Uh, yeah. Yeah I do,” he stammered, and pulled out his wallet. He flipped through the selection of counterfeit IDs and badges, none of which were appropriate to the era. Settling for the most promising one, Sam flashed it at her briefly, then folded it back into his wallet before she could get a good look.</p><p>“Secret Service,” he intoned, changing tack to sound more serious.</p><p>The girl glanced over her shoulder at a morose-looking man sitting behind a typewriter, toward the back of the cluttered office. Her boss, Sam decided. He didn’t look any happier to be there than she did.</p><p>“Just one moment,” she said, getting up to talk to her boss. After a brief back-and-forth, the man came to speak with Sam directly. His narrow tie was knotted too tightly around his neck, making his head look like a bright-red balloon about to pop. Must be part of the dress code, Sam thought.</p><p>“Can I help you?” the man asked gruffly.</p><p>“Hi...” Sam replied, looking down at the man’s nametag, “Mr. Walker. The Secret Service requires a selection of blueprints for the Waldorf Astoria hotel.” Sam pulled out the fake ID again, intending to flash it for only a moment, but Walker grabbed the wallet out of his hand.</p><p>“Counterfeiters,” he barked.</p><p>“Uh, excuse me?” Sam responded, his hand reaching protectively for his wallet.</p><p>“What does this have to do with counterfeiters?” Walker asked, handing the wallet back to Sam.</p><p>“Oh, right. I don’t deal with counterfeit money,” Sam said, then he lowered his voice. “I protect President...” His mind raced, Who was the President of the United States in 1954? After Truman, before Kennedy. “Eisenhower. Sorry, we usually refer to him by his code name.” He leaned in, whispering, “It’s ‘Papa Bear.’”</p><p>The girl, who was now standing next to her boss, gave Sam a curious look, but Walker didn’t seem to have noticed Sam’s lapse.</p><p>“That right?” he said.</p><p>“He’ll be staying at the Waldorf Astoria in a few days. In the Presidential Suite,” Sam said.</p><p>“I’ll be damned. Ike staying right down the street from us!” Walker said, excited.</p><p>“Yes,” Sam agreed. “It’s very exciting for the people of New York. We—my colleagues and I—need to review the plans to look for security weaknesses in the hotel.” It was half true. With the plans, Sam was hoping to find an alternative entrance into the suite that wouldn’t draw suspicion from the Waldorf’s security, who would recognise Dean.</p><p>“They ain’t got that at the hotel? Seems they probably got a better idea about their plans and such than we would.” Walker had a point, of course, but the Waldorf employees would also know that Eisenhower had no plans to visit in the near future. This was the only way.</p><p>“Just doing my due diligence,” Sam replied.</p><p>“Marcia, see if we ain’t got that in the records,” Walker commanded, sending the girl scurrying away into the back room. “Say, what’s old Ike like, anyhow?”</p><p>“Oh, he’s... great. Just a swell guy. Really... tall.”</p><p>“Yeah? Got any stories?”</p><p>“Of course, but, you know, they’re top secret,” Sam said, trying to hold his poker face.</p><p>“Ah. ‘Course.” Walker said, disappointed. He looked like he was going to persist when, to Sam’s relief, Marcia returned to the desk with the plans.</p><p>Finding a corner table in the Records Office reading room, Sam poured over the blueprints, searching for a back door, a nearby service elevator—anything that would make their trip in and out of the Presidential Suite easier. He couldn’t help but think about how much simpler this would be in 2010. Electronic records had saved them more times than Sam could count, and symbols that were taking him ages to decipher could have been explained with a ten-second Google search. He’d definitely appreciate that convenience more when—if—they ever got back to the present.</p><p>Just as Sam was about to give up, Walker barged into the reading room, another rolled-up set of blueprints under his arm.</p><p>“Can’t believe I forgot about these,” he said, plopping the prints onto the table in front of Sam.</p><p>Sam looked at the designs, but wasn’t able to make head or tail of it.</p><p>“Being as he’s the President, it seems appropriate that he use the Presidential Siding,” Walker explained.</p><p>“The what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Are you kiddin’ me?” Walker’s face creased. He pointed at a knot of intersecting white lines against the field of blue paper. “You don’t know what’s under the Waldorf?”</p><p>And with that, Sam’s plan began to come together.</p><p>Dean woke up with a start to the noise of a dump truck reversing down the street outside. The sun blazed in through the small, barred window, brightly illuminating the fact that Sam wasn’t in his bed.</p><p>“Sam?” Dean called out. “You up?”</p><p>When no one responded, he slid off the couch and headed for the shower. Eight hours of sleep plus time for a hot shower. Dean hadn’t had both in months, probably not since Lucifer had been popped from his cage.</p><p>After his shower, he went straight to work disassembling the shotgun shells Sam had bought and refilling them with rock salt. He was nearly finished when the sound of keys rattled in the door’s deadbolt.</p><p>“Sam, that you?”</p><p>“It’s me. Don’t shoot,” came the muffled reply. As the door swung open, Dean’s eyes caught on the brown paper bag in Sam’s outstretched hand. It bore the unmistakable grease stains that came along with a cheeseburger, and instantly dispelled any hard feelings Dean had left over from the previous night’s conversation.</p><p>“Fastest way to a man’s heart, right?” he said, grabbing the bag and opening it. The smell was amazing, just the thing to remind Dean why life was worth living. “Where you been, anyway?”</p><p>Sam sat down next to Dean on the couch and grabbed his own burger from the bag.</p><p>“Clerk’s office, looking for blueprints,” he said.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And the good news is I may have found us an exit. The bad news is there’s only one elevator that services the Presidential Suite, and a security desk is right outside it.” Sam set his burger down without even taking a bite.</p><p>“You not eating that?” Dean asked, mouth full, then registered Sam’s annoyance. “What?”</p><p>“This would be a lot easier if you hadn’t been banned from the hotel,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean nodded toward the stack of rock salt shells he’d been working on.</p><p>“Hey, I’ve been doin’ my part. ‘Sides, you’re the one that dumped us on the Magic School Bus for this field trip.”</p><p>Sam didn’t protest, but he also didn’t jump in to apologize. Dean shrugged. Sam’s stubbornness was genetic—their father had it as well, and it was the thing that had driven them apart. Ironically enough, Dean, the boy who worshipped the ground his father walked on, was less like John Winchester than the son who wanted nothing to do with him.</p><p>“Look, you wanna do your part, find another way to get into that meeting,” Sam said.</p><p>“Maybe we need to consider you flying solo,” Dean suggested.</p><p>“Are you serious?” Sam asked. “A few weeks ago you weren’t sure I was even cut out for hunting anymore, now you want me to commit armed robbery by myself?”</p><p>“You don’t think you can do it?”</p><p>“Of course I can do it,” Sam answered, agitated. “But is that our best plan? I show up, claiming to have 200,000 dollars in a briefcase, grab the scroll and run?”</p><p>“Sounds like a Winchester plan to me,” Dean said, licking his fingers clean of burger grease.</p><p>“Sounds like a stupid plan.”</p><p>“Usually it’s both.”</p><p>“Then let’s come up with a better one,” Sam offered. “From what Walter Sawyer told me, there could be a dozen people and institutions interested in the scrolls, so security is going to be tight. Maybe we can use that to our advantage. Create a diversion.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like where this was headed.</p><p>“By diversion, you mean me doing something stupid so you can smash-and-grab the scroll.”</p><p>“They know you,” Sam replied. “The guards upstairs will recognize you, so it won’t be hard for you to get a little attention.”</p><p>“And then they shoot me, you take off with the War Scroll, they shoot you, and our angel buddy can zap our corpses back to 2010,” Dean scoffed.</p><p>“What if your distraction isn’t, you know, violent?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Like I ask politely?”</p><p>“Like you pretend to be a Fed,” Sam said. “Or somebody who doesn’t believe the documents are genuine, come to warn the buyers that the seller’s a fraud.”</p><p>“Alright,” Dean said, gears clicking into place in his head. “Say that works. I bust up the proceedings, your boy Feldman is distracted, you grab the scroll... What about the demon?”</p><p>Sam’s face fell. If the demon was acting as a protector of the scroll, there was no telling what it would do.</p><p>“Last I saw, that guard seemed back to normal,” Dean said. “So it could be in anyone. Assuming it is some kind of protector, he’ll be there at the sale.”</p><p>“And we don’t have the knife.”</p><p>“You mean you lost the knife,” Dean pointed out.</p><p>“If we could get up there early, we could set up a Devil’s Trap, lure him into it,” Sam said, blowing past Dean’s accusation.</p><p>“But we can’t, so plan B,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam nodded toward the stack of rock salt shells Dean had spent the morning preparing.</p><p>“Salt shells will keep a demon at bay, but how do we get a couple of shotguns upstairs?”</p><p>“Easy,” Dean said. “We find a case big enough to fit ‘em, and you waltz right in carrying it. 200,000 bucks must take up a lot of space.”</p><p>“Security, Dean. They’ll check the case.”</p><p>As it was still untouched, Dean took another large bite out of Sam’s burger, letting the taste linger in his mouth for a bit. He did his best thinking while eating.</p><p>“Luggage,” he said finally.</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“We wait around the loading dock till it’s unattended, which it will be, because those bellhops are frickin’ lazy, trust me,” Dean answered. “Then we throw the shotguns in a bag headed for the suite. They’ll be there waiting for us.”</p><p>“That’s never going to work.” Sam let out a sigh.</p><p>“Don’t see you coming up with a better plan,” Dean said angrily, though he knew Sam was right. Getting the guns upstairs was one thing, getting access to them and pulling off the heist was something else entirely.</p><p>“We’re a little outside our comfort zone, Dean, but we’ve got to figure this out.”</p><p>“I know. Stop the Apocalypse, kill the Devil, reunite the Spice Girls, there’s a lot on our plate,” Dean said, starting to pace the small room. “Maybe we’re looking at this wrong. Maybe we go after the scroll once the buyer leaves with it. Jump ‘em outside.”</p><p>“How are we supposed to know who the buyer is?” Sam asked. “We wait outside, they could walk right past us with the scrolls in a briefcase and we’d never know.”</p><p>Picking up one of the rock salt shells, Dean started to flip the cartridge between his fingers.</p><p>“Well, whoever has a frickin’ demon following him, screaming bloody murder, that’s probably him.”</p><p>The discussion went round and round, not leading any place productive for over an hour. Dean wanted nothing more than to get out of the cramped apartment, but this particular dilemma needed all brains on deck. Finally, Sam relented and stepped into the bathroom, giving Dean the perfect opportunity to escape outside for some air. No one wanted to be near the bathroom when Sam was in it.</p><p>Seated on the front stoop of the apartment building, Dean watched as a stream of New Yorkers marched past, hurrying away the afternoon. They don’t know what’s coming, he thought, feeling for a moment like Sarah Connor in T2, the harbinger of doom nestled amidst the blissfully unaware. Of course, these people have fifty-six good years left. Not like us.</p><p>Sam joined him after a few minutes, both of them listening intently to the sound of traffic, taking in all of the sights and sounds of the run-down neighborhood.</p><p>As if he could read Dean’s thoughts, Sam suddenly laughed.</p><p>“Admit it,” he said. “You miss Dr. Sexy.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Early the next morning, Sam and Dean headed uptown to the Waldorf. Sam had insisted on another walkthrough of the lobby, and if they could get up as far as the Presidential Suite without arousing suspicion, then all the better.</p><p>While Dean skulked around the loading dock, Sam headed to the stairwell. He wanted to make sure that the exit strategy he had formulated from the blueprints would hold up in real life.</p><p>Slogging his way up the many flights of stairs was the most exercise Sam had done in weeks. Around the twentieth story, ascending to the top began to feel like an impossible task. It’d be pretty sad to die of a heart attack now, Sam thought. Whether that would be a good or bad thing for the world was another matter.</p><p>In the middle of contemplating that idea, a thunderous bark echoed up the stairwell, jolting Sam to attention. A second later, another bark pounded his eardrums, and he gripped his hands against his head tightly. If that’s a dog, Sam thought, I don’t want to meet its owner.</p><p>With the third bout of vicious howling, Sam realized that the noise was getting closer. It was coming up the stairwell—and fast. Dean said the demon barked. I don’t really want to find out if he’s right. He took the steps two at a time, hoping to outrun whatever hellish beast was downstairs. Hellish beast, Sam thought. It sounds exactly how I always imagined a Hellhound to sound.</p><p>Satan’s guard dogs, Hellhounds were the invisible beasts responsible for keeping up the nasty end of Hell’s bargains. If the demon that Dean met was somehow a Hellhound, or something like it, they were in even more trouble than they had thought.</p><p>The sound of water dripping was driving Dean crazy. Somewhere, some jackass hadn’t tightened a valve, or a nut, or whatever it was that kept water from leaking, and now it was ruining both Dean’s day and his nice new suit jacket.</p><p>He had been forced to hide in a storage locker when a truckload of perishables was delivered to the loading dock, only to have the kitchen staff take their lunch break right outside. It wasn’t the most undignified place Dean had ever hidden, but it was up there.</p><p>“Have I told you what happened at the Yankees’ game?” a muffled voice said outside the locker. For a moment, Dean pictured himself holding a baseball bat and using it to punish the kitchen workers for the twenty minutes of dull-as-shit conversation he’d been forced to endure. I bet Sam’s having fun, he thought bitterly.</p><p>The metal edge of the stair rushed at Sam’s face, catching him between the ear and eyebrow and momentarily blurring his vision. He had tripped while running up the flight of stairs, and from the sound of it, the Hellhound—or whatever it was—was only seconds behind him. Pushing himself upright, Sam risked a glance down the cavernous opening in the middle of the stairwell. It led all the way to the ground floor, maybe even underground.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Hellhounds are invisible, Sam reminded himself. Keep running.</p><p>Lactic acid burned in his calves as he sprinted upward. Ahead of him, the door to the fortieth floor was only meters away. A terrible growling reverberated through the stairwell. Any moment Sam expected to feel the dig of teeth clamping onto his leg, but the sensation never came.</p><p>He darted into the hallway of the fortieth floor, slamming the door shut behind him. He scanned the space around him, but didn’t see anything that could be used to barricade the door. He did, however, hear something. The familiar electric buzz of a vending machine was coming from a nearby room. Bolting inside, Sam quickly locked the door. He found himself in what looked like a staff break room.</p><p>The snack machine weighed far more than Sam expected it to, and as he attempted to slide it along the floor it tipped over on its side. The laminate flooring shook with the massive crash, and Sam flinched. Everyone on this floor must have heard that. On the plus side, the machine was much easier to move now it was on its side. Sam slid it toward the door, effectively blocking it.</p><p>Bags of pretzels hung haphazardly inside the vending machine, with big chunks of Kosher salt on them. Sam kicked through the glass and pulled out as many bags of pretzels as he could. He crushed them in his hands and poured the contents across the vending machine. Whether that was enough salt to keep a demon or Hellhound at bay, Sam wasn’t sure.</p><p>He took a few moments to catch his breath, his ragged gasps for oxygen overpowering any noise from beyond the door. Leaning against the downed vending machine, he held in his breath for five seconds, allowing him to hear a raspy intake of air from the other side of the door. Some of the pretzel crumbs retreated under the door with the beast’s inhale.</p><p>It’s sniffing me out, Sam realized. It knows I’m here. But the door never rattled and the beast never brayed. Instead, Sam heard the hollow clomping of feet on metal stairs. The creature was moving on.</p><p>Sam waited a couple more minutes, then pushed the vending machine away from the door. He stepped over his makeshift salt and pretzel line and sighed. That was close.</p><p>“You must of been hungry,” a voice said from down the hall. Sam looked up to see an elderly woman standing there, wearing a plaid bathrobe and holding an empty ice bucket with both hands. She nodded toward the pile of snacks that had spilled out of the machine, and the accompanying broken glass.</p><p>Sam shrugged. “It stole my quarter.”</p><p>For Dean, sweet relief came in the form of a hotel supervisor, who marched down to the loading dock and admonished the kitchen staff for letting the perishables sit for so long without refrigeration. Dean was spared. As they exited, a burly-sounding line cook with a Jersey accent said something about a package being moved through the kitchen, but Dean couldn’t hear the full exchange. The one phrase he definitely heard was “big-ass jars.” They must have been moving the scrolls upstairs, Dean thought. Hope Sammy hasn’t run into any trouble.</p><p>Wringing the moisture out of his jacket, Dean exited the loading dock and headed back toward the Park Avenue entrance where he was supposed to meet Sam.</p><p>Oddly, Sam wasn’t waiting. Being the more punctual of the two of them, it wasn’t like Sam to miss a rendez vous. Taking a chance on not being recognized again, Dean smiled at the hotel doorman and strode boldly into the lobby. The dick desk clerk was on duty, so Dean joined a large crowd that was milling near the lounge’s piano. Sam wasn’t in the lobby, but the stairwell he’d taken would spit him out right in front of the crowd. A red-haired man was playing the piano with some proficiency, although Dean didn’t recognize the song.</p><p>Trying to blend into the group, Dean watched as a woman approached the pianist. She patted him kindly on the shoulder, whispered in his ear... and with the practiced skill of a professional, lifted the wallet from his jacket pocket.</p><p>She moved off quickly, but Dean was only seconds behind her. As she made her way toward the elevators, Dean grabbed her by the arm and spun her to face him.</p><p>“Should have friggin’ guessed,” he said.</p><p>The woman was Julia.</p><p>“Ah, how nice to see you again, Mister... I’m sorry, I’ve forgotten your name,” she said formally.</p><p>“Don’t sweat it, it wasn’t my real name anyway,” Dean responded bitterly. “Let’s go have a chat with the nice piano man.” He tugged at her arm, pulling her back toward the lobby. But she resisted, digging her heels into the floor.</p><p>“I’m sorry, but I really have to get back to my room,” she said.</p><p>“We’re not done talking yet,” Dean threatened.</p><p>“Let go of my arm.”</p><p>“Give the ginger back his wallet,” Dean hissed, nodding toward the guy at the piano. Julia began to visibly struggle against Dean’s grip, attracting the attention of several other guests.</p><p>“Is there a problem, here?” a man asked, looking concerned.</p><p>With forced theatricality, Julia squeezed out a tear.</p><p>“This man has me confused with someone else,” she said with a sob.</p><p>Dean realized he had no choice but to let her go, and released his grip on her arm. She immediately hurried toward the elevator. Dean made to follow her, but was blocked by the hairy forearm of the dick desk clerk.</p><p>“You’ve been banned from the building,” he said. Then yelled, “Security!”</p><p>Julia stepped into the elevator and spoke quietly to the operator. Dean grabbed his opportunity, jamming his hand against the closing doors, halting them before she could disappear.</p><p>“What do you want with us?” he demanded. But before he could continue, he was pulled away by a trio of burly hotel employees and dragged roughly outside. He’d never been so quickly and efficiently bounced from an establishment before, and it seemed strange that it wasn’t for drunkenness.</p><p>Sam was waiting outside, eyes wide and with a fire in them that Dean hadn’t seen in weeks.</p><p>“What’s the haps? Where you been?” Dean asked, but Sam ignored his question.</p><p>“We need to leave. Now,” he said.</p><p>“So, is it a Hellhound, or a dude?” Dean asked, nursing a beer. “I’m lost.”</p><p>“I don’t know. It sure as hell sounded hellish, but I didn’t actually see anything.”</p><p>“Yeah, ‘cause you were hiding in the snack room.”</p><p>They had spent the rest of the day and into the evening trying to figure out exactly what the new developments meant for their plan. Dean had insisted that they hole up in a nearby dive bar, despite Sam’s protests. With the deal taking place the next day, they hardly had time to drink, but that had never stopped Dean before.</p><p>“You couldn’t have peeked out for a second?” Dean persisted.</p><p>His brother rolled his eyes, fed up with the circular conversation.</p><p>“I never saw the one that gutted you, either.”</p><p>“‘Cause that’s fair,” Dean muttered. “But you didn’t see its, like, hoof-marks—“</p><p>“It’s a dog, not a horse.”</p><p>“Whatever, but you didn’t see —“</p><p>“I didn’t see anything,” Sam shot back impatiently.</p><p>Their waitress came by with another pitcher of beer, but Sam shook his head at her. He then waited until she was out of earshot before continuing.</p><p>“So we have a demon, possibly a Hellhound, a scroll that could kill the Devil, no workable plan for how to get it, and apparently a pickpocket who has her eye on you.”</p><p>“Yeah, we’re doing pretty well, all told,” Dean said with a smirk. He pushed back his chair. “Time for bed.”</p><p>Sam followed his brother out of the bar and into the cool night, torn between needing his bed and wanting to better figure out their strategy for the next day. They had walked several blocks toward their apartment before he spoke up again.</p><p>“It’s my life on the line. I’m not sure we should be winging this.”</p><p>“We’ll do our best, Sammy. That’s all we can do.”</p><p>Just before midnight, James McMannon found himself standing in the hallway outside the Presidential Suite, walking the distance between the elevator, the stairwell and the suite’s door with an even cadence. He couldn’t particularly remember why he had chosen this hallway to walk in, or what he had been doing before he got here, but he knew that what he was doing was important. Someone has to be here, he thought.</p><p>Inside the Presidential Suite, something was giving off an incredible aroma. Like nothing James had ever smelled before. It made him feel very protective, as if it was his own child beyond that door.</p><p>Child. Nephew. Barney. Dead.</p><p>The words made James furious, but he couldn’t remember why. Did something happen to Barney?</p><p>No matter. James had to concentrate on whatever was inside the suite. The smell.</p><p>If anyone tries to take it away, I’ll kill them.</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam looks goofy in his suit, Dean thought with a chuckle. It was the morning of their big day, and Sam was doing his best to look respectable, but as usual the formal clothing just didn’t look right on his tall frame. They’d been over their plan several times already, but Sam demanded they run through it again. It still wasn’t much, but Dean had come up with a new idea overnight that might get them out alive. Whether or not they got the scroll was another matter.</p><p>Once Dean had suited up, the two of them made their way uptown to the Waldorf. They were about an hour early, which gave them time to move cautiously. Getting caught with a duffel bag full of shotguns and shells probably wouldn’t go over too well with the NYPD, even in the fifties. They’d bought a briefcase at a pawnshop for Sam to carry into the meeting, but with no way to procure the necessary funds, it was packed with old newspapers to give it some weight, and secured with an impressive-looking lock. Their entire plan hinged on Security not kicking Sam out for being broke before the auction had even begun.</p><p>Setting down the duffel on the street outside the Waldorf, Dean looked up at the building’s façade and smiled. What he saw there put his part of the plan in motion. Jesus, he mused, this could actually work.</p><p>The elevator rattled disconcertingly as it made its way up to the Presidential Suite. Sam tried to ignore it. He already felt like his stomach was in his throat, what was a little bit of motion sickness compared to the prospect of armed robbery?</p><p>Standing outside the elevator were two Waldorf security guards and a uniformed police officer. The cop looked annoyed to be there, probably thinking that no one would care enough about some old pieces of parchment to cause any trouble. Boy was he wrong.</p><p>“I’m here for the auction,” Sam said, aware that he was stating the obvious. The entire floor looked to be shut down for the event. A desk had been set up perpendicular to the elevators, effectively barricading one entire side of the corridor. The uniformed officer sat behind the desk.</p><p>“Your name?” he asked dully.</p><p>“Bob Singer,” Sam replied. “Maybe under Robert.” The policeman looked up at him with exasperation. “But you probably could have guessed that.”</p><p>“Yeah,” the cop said. “Thanks.”</p><p>Sam took a step toward the suite and felt a hand on his shoulder. It was one of the two Waldorf employees—the grungier of the two; the guy looked like he hadn’t slept in a week. Before Sam could say anything, the man narrowed his eyes and sniffed the air. Like a dog, Sam thought. That’s creepy.</p><p>“James, what the hell?” the other employee said, breaking the tension.</p><p>“He smells like death,” James said, his nose furrowing. As Sam girded himself for what seemed like an inevitable brawl, James cracked a smile, then started patting Sam down, looking for a concealed weapon. Yeah, still creepy, Sam thought.</p><p>Without meeting James’s gaze, he turned and grabbed the door handle to the Presidential Suite. Guess Dean’s man-dog theory was right. Not that it made any sense.</p><p>“Your briefcase, sir?” the other guy said.</p><p>“What about it?” Sam responded.</p><p>“We do not require the combination, sir, but we do require that you leave it outside of the suite. The Waldorf Astoria will take full responsibility for its contents during the auction.</p><p>Perfect, Sam thought. As long as they don’t get curious, I’m home free. He handed the briefcase off to the policeman at the desk and entered the suite. Paintings cluttered the walls of the entranceway, which was by itself fancier than any place Sam had ever stayed. It was a good thing he’d studied the blueprints of the place, or he’d have been too much in awe to keep his focus. To the right, a hallway led to the master bedroom—The bedroom where Kennedy will someday sleep, and Obama, Sam thought. To the left, an archway led into a small dining area, the table set with silver utensils and fine crystal. The suite had its own kitchen, and Sam spent a moment picturing Bill Clinton raiding the fridge in the middle of the night looking for spare ribs.</p><p>Across from Sam, past a small couch and chaise longue, was the main room of the suite. A cluster of people stood inside, chatting softly under the light of a chandelier. Nicer surroundings than our usual jobs, Sam thought. The only person in the group he recognized was Benjamin Shochat, Mr. Feldman’s aide. As he entered the main room, Sam noticed the collection of ornate clay jars on the center table.</p><p>“Welcome, Mr. Singer,” Shochat said with a wry grin. “So glad you could attend. Let me introduce you to my employer.” He waved his hand toward an elderly gentleman who was hunched protectively over the jars. The man looked at least eighty years old, but as he looked up at Sam, his eyes betrayed his still-sharp wit. His olive brow was deeply creased, a telltale sign of a stressful life. The complete absence of laugh lines further proved Sam’s assumption— this guy meant business.</p><p>“Mr. Singer, this is Mr. Feldman. The owner of the scrolls,” Shochat introduced him.</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Singer,” Feldman said, his voice like gravel. “You have me very curious. Benjamin told me you were a young man, but I hadn’t fathomed the, well... extent of your youth.” He gestured toward the other potential buyers, all of them middle-aged. “I thought this to be an old man’s game.”</p><p>“I’m, uh, flattered, Mr. Feldman. But I’m merely a representative,” Sam responded.</p><p>The old man pursed his lips, considering that.</p><p>“As long as they have the money, anyone is welcome here,” he stated.</p><p>Sam took that as his cue to mingle. He approached a nervous-looking man, whose red hair seemed to glow in the chandelier-light.</p><p>“Mr. Singer—“ Sam began, but he was cut off abruptly.</p><p>“I know your name,” the man blurted excitedly. “You just said it. Why wouldn’t I have heard it?”</p><p>“Uh, sorry, just being polite.” Sam wasn’t going to make any new friends in this room, that much was clear.</p><p>“Aren’t you going to ask my name?” the red-haired man demanded.</p><p>“Wasn’t planning on it,” Sam replied, his attention now fixed on a table of hors d’oeuvres. He clocked a plate of deviled eggs, but was blocked by the red-haired man’s hand.</p><p>“Eli Thurman,” he said, and Sam found himself forced into a long and awkward conversation about what he felt the Dead Sea Scrolls meant for modern theologians. As the discussion twisted around topics Sam barely understood and certainly didn’t care about, he had to bite his tongue to stop himself from bringing up the Apocalypse. “Hey Eli, did you know I unleashed Satan?” he wanted to say. The socially-awkward yet talkative man would probably drop dead on the spot.</p><p>Twenty minutes of boredom later, Shochat brought the room to attention with a clink of his wine glass.</p><p>“Our last guest is arriving now, so we’ll be starting the sale.”</p><p>After all of the surprises the last week had brought, Sam was too worn out to act shocked. Instead, he just looked the newest arrival in the eye and extended a hand. “</p><p>Hi, Walter. Wasn’t expecting to see you here.”</p><p>Dean appreciated irony the most when it involved smashing public property. Yesterday, dripping water had nearly ruined his jacket, and now, the water that sprayed out of the broken Park Avenue fire hydrant would save his ass. The first phase of Dean’s plan was complete, and all it took was a wrench and the chutzpah to cause a ruckus in front of all of New York.</p><p>Scores of people assembled to watch the plume of water soak the sidewalk, Park Avenue, and a good portion of the Waldorf façade. One of those people, exactly according to plan, was the dick receptionist. A pleasant side effect of Dean’s mischief was the squeals of hoity-toity women trying to exit the Waldorf without getting wet. Ain’t happening, ladies.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Dean was able to slip into the loading dock and enter the service elevator, the duffel bag of shotguns slung over his shoulder. The next portion of his plan could very well be the stupidest thing Dean had ever tried, but there was no knowing for sure unless he did it.</p><p>The elevator’s dial pushed up to the forty-seventh floor. He’d have to hoof it from there. Exiting the elevator, Dean quickly found the roof-access stairwell and made his way back out into sunlight.</p><p>“That you, Johnny?” a voice demanded from across the roof. Most likely the person Dean was looking for.</p><p>“It’s, uh, Tony. Johnny’s... sick,” Dean said, hoping thatwould at least prevent the man from calling Security. There was a long pause and Dean took the opportunity to unzip the duffel, readying himself for a fight.</p><p>“Well, you here to help or what?” the man called.</p><p>Dean took the unexpected charity fate had given him. He zipped the bag back up and hoisted it onto his shoulder. Quickly bypassing a large power converter box, he got a glimpse of his target—a mustached man of Italian heritage who could have easily been cast as the third Mario brother. He was seated precariously on the building’s ledge, nonchalantly eating a Reuben sandwich.</p><p>“You the window washer?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No, I just come up here for the fresh mountain air,” the guy said dryly, kicking at the large squeegee lying on the roof next to him. “Now get strapped in, I’ll lower you down with the rest of the guys.”</p><p>As Dean stepped closer, he got a look over the edge and into the deep canyon that was 50^th^ Street.</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll just str...” he trailed off, looking at the mechanism in question. “Son of a bitch,” he said, eyeing a mangled knot in the system of ropes, levers and pulleys anchored to the hotel’s roof. I’m supposed to go over the edge of the building strapped to that?</p><p>“What’s the problem,” the man said. It wasn’t really a question. The prevailing implication was that Dean was a sissy, and that a real man wouldn’t doubt the efficacy of the system. A slice of corned beef worked its way out of the window washer’s sandwich, falling over the ledge and down into the abyss of New York City. The man leant further overthe edge and called out, “Sorry ‘bout that, Lenny.”</p><p>Several waves of vertigo washed over Dean, one after another, stopping him from moving any closer to the ledge. Dean hated flying, and standing at the edge of a 500-foot chasm was twice as bad.</p><p>Okay, maybe this isn’t gonna work.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Guess I’ll have to find another translator, Sam thought. Something tells me that Walter won’t appreciate having a shotgun stuck in his face. Five minutes into the sale, Walter had only made a single low-ball bid—whether that was due to strategy or limited funds, Sam couldn’t be sure. Of course, Sam didn’t have any money, either.</p><p>Of the half-dozen interested parties, only three of them were truly serious about buying the scrolls. Eli Thurman, Sam’s alter ego, Robert Singer, and a Midwestern man who had introduced himself simply as “Gerald.”</p><p>Eli had initially offered 100,000 dollars, which everyone knew was too low a price. Gerald quickly countered with 115,000 dollars, which Sam raised by another 10,000 dollars. In the early phase of the sale, Sam concentrated on Shochat, who was moving deliberately around the room, looking out the windows, checking the side rooms, and not-too-subtly fingering the safety on the gun in his pants pocket.</p><p>As the bids grew higher, the three less-serious buyers dropped out entirely. Gerald and Eli were the most active in the auction, with Sam chiming in every now and then to keep things interesting. It began to feel like the sale might finish without incident when the sound of a commotion interrupted the proceedings. A large mass thumped against the door, then slid slowly down it.</p><p>Sam was the first on his feet, but Shochat pushed him back down to the couch.</p><p>“Go, Benjamin,” Mr. Feldman said calmly. Shochat followed the order, heading slowly toward the suite’s entrance, his pistol raised.</p><p>Sam quickly realized that his brother could be the cause of the noise. It wasn’t what they had planned, but it might be Dean’s plan B. Sam leaned his weight onto the balls of his feet, ready to spring for the clay jars.</p><p>“Who’s there?” Shochat’s voice demanded. He was now out of Sam’s line of sight.</p><p>The room was silent as everyone waited for a response, but there was no answer.</p><p>Come on, Dean, don’t get yourself shot.</p><p>On cue, Sam heard the door swing open. Two heartbeats later, a gunshot rang out, sending Sam leaping to his feet.</p><p>“Stop!” Mr. Feldman cried, putting himself between Sam and the jars.</p><p>Sam had enough inertia to plow the older man through the window, but he wasn’t going for the jars. He was going for the entrance lounge, where hopefully Dean wasn’t lying dead on the floor. His haste caused him to crash directly into Shochat, as he stumbled back into the room, clutching his bloody hand.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam called out, pushing Shochat aside.</p><p>“‘Fraid not, sweetie,” a melodious voice replied. A young woman charged into the room, a black pistol in her hand. She was beautiful, and vaguely familiar. That must be the girl, Sam realized, Julia.</p><p>Across the room, Walter swallowed hard. “Dear, what did I tell you about collateral damage?” he said.</p><p>Julia rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Keep it to a minimum. I know, Dad.”</p><p>Up on the roof, Dean was experiencing full-blown panic. There was no way he’d be able to go through with the plan. Rappelling down the side of a skyscraper strapped to a leather harness is not a friggin’ option. Sam is just going to have to say “yes” to Satan and fight the good fight.</p><p>“You’ve gotta calm yourself down, buddy,” the window washer said encouragingly. “You get nerves on this job, you’re gonna end up schmeared on a taxi like cream cheese.”</p><p>“What’s your name again?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Marco,” the man replied.</p><p>“Listen Marco, I need you to shut the hell up for a second.”</p><p>In all of their years hunting, Dean had never been this crippled by fear. Well, except for the ghost sickness, he remembered, but that wasn’t my fault.</p><p>Sam is down there, counting on you. Man the hell up.</p><p>“Okay,” Dean said, mustering all of his courage. “This is gonna come as a shock, but I’m new at this.”</p><p>“You don’t say,” Marco replied, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“So if you could lose the d-bag attitude for a second and help me get this harness on—“</p><p>“D-bag? Like a duffel?”</p><p>“It’s something your kids are gonna call you behind your back,” Dean said under his breath, picking up the extra leather harness.</p><p>“What’s in your d-bag, by the way?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>Marco pointed at Dean’s weapon-filled duffel bag, which was still slung over his shoulder.</p><p>“Lunch.”</p><p>“Better eat it now. Leave it up here and it’ll be gone as soon as one of these guys comes up to piss.”</p><p>“Guess I’ll have to take it with me then,” Dean said.</p><p>With Marco’s help, he was soon strapped in and standing at the building’s precipice. Five other window washers were already suspended from the roof, working twenty flights above the roar of traffic below. The flood of taxis on 50^th^ Street looked the size of Hot Wheels, which didn’t help Dean’s vertigo in the slightest.</p><p>Dangling one foot over the ledge, he tried to count the floors down to the Presidential Suite. Thirty-fifth floor, he told himself. Twelve floors straight down. I can do this. Sam wouldn’t even think twice, and he’s a salad-eating nancy. With one last tug on the strap, he began to lower himself down the building’s façade.</p><p>“Hey, you forgetting something?” Marco called. In his outstretched hand he held a leather belt fitted with spray bottles and a squeegee. “Gotta say, Tony, even for a beginner, you suck at this.”</p><p>Taking the tool belt, Dean began his descent.</p><p>Walter and Julia weren’t wasting any time. They’d corralled Mr. Feldman, Shochat and the prospective buyers in a corner of the Presidential Suite, all of their faces wet with tears from the pepper spray Julia had used on the guards outside. No one had been killed, which was a relief, but Sam knew that could change in an instant if someone didn’t cooperate.</p><p>Blood from Shochat’s gunshot wound dripped onto Sam’s shoes. With Julia and Walter distracted by their examination of the clay jars, Sam pulled down one of the ornate curtains and ripped it into long strips, giving them to Benjamin to wrap around his hand.</p><p>“What do you think you’re doing?” Julia yelled.</p><p>“Keeping him from bleeding to death,” Sam replied angrily.</p><p>Before Julia could react, Walter interceded.</p><p>“It’s okay, Jules. We don’t want anybody to get hurt.”</p><p>Julia scoffed. She was clearly bad cop to Walter’s good cop.</p><p>“It’s too late for that,” Mr. Feldman said mournfully. His eyes weren’t on his assistant, but rather on the tallest jar, which Walter was carefully wrenching open. Sam noticed that he had dispensed with his sling.</p><p>“You think we want to do this?” Julia spat at Feldman. “This is for your own damn good.”</p><p>Sam caught a glimpse of the Devil’s Trap inscribed on the top of the lid as Walter set it back on the table.</p><p>“You don’t want to be opening that here, Walter,” he said.</p><p>“I know what I’m doing, Sam.”</p><p>“Sam?” Shochat questioned, looking puzzled. “I thought your name was Robert?”</p><p>“It’s Sam to my friends,” he said, with a hard look at Walter. “And people I thought were my friends.”</p><p>Walter looked away. Reaching into the open jar, he grasped at the contents. Sam flinched, the millennia-old scrolls would be impossibly delicate.</p><p>“Walter...” Sam said, again trying to warn him. But before he could continue Julia thrust her gun into his face.</p><p>“You want to let him concentrate,” she said through gritted teeth. “If this goes wrong, people are going to get thrown out the window.”</p><p>You have no idea, Sam thought.</p><p>Walter pulled a petrified-looking black object out of the jar with some difficulty. It clearly wasn’t a scroll, but rather some sort of stopper—an additional moisture barrier put in place to protect the fragile parchment, Sam guessed. Walter studied it closely, then set it aside, once more reaching into the jar. This time, his eyes lit up like a kid at Christmas. He must have struck parchment, Sam figured.</p><p>Outside the suite, something scraped heavily against the door.</p><p>“What was that?” Julia demanded.</p><p>“You tell me,” her father replied without looking up from his work. “You were supposed to handle them.” As he lifted the first scroll out of the jar, his joyous look faded. “Not the right one,” he muttered.</p><p>“Keep looking. I’ve got this,” Julia said, moving toward the door.</p><p>Sam took the opportunity to step out of the corner and over to Walter.</p><p>“You don’t have to do this,” he said softly. “You want to read the scrolls, wait for them to show up in a museum.”</p><p>“That’s not how it works, Sam,” the man replied. “The document I’m looking for is never going to be in a museum. If the wrong people get their hands on it...” He looked pointedly at red-headed Eli. “Well, that would be bad.”</p><p>Sam began to wonder exactly what Walter’s endgame was. Would he disappear with the scroll, abandoning his life in New York?</p><p>Julia returned from the door, pistol again trained on Sam and the others.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” she said. “One of the guards twitching in his sleep. Now let’s get out of here.”</p><p>“This is it,” Walter said, hefting a second piece of parchment.</p><p>The War Scroll.</p><p>That’s not good, Sam thought. They’re after the same page that we are. Chances are, they’re not going to just hand it over once they hear our story.</p><p>James McMannon woke with a start. His head was ringing, his body was slumped against an overturned desk and his eyes were seared by pepper spray. Where am I? he wondered, before recognizing the slightly blurred but distinct carpeting of the Waldorf Astoria underneath him.</p><p>Memories flooded back all at once; the girl pistol-whipping him, his nephew, the strange fixation he’d had with that smell... That smell... It suddenly filled his nostrils, and everything else faded away. He had to get to that smell. Someone was trying to take it away from him, and that must not be allowed.</p><p>“What the hell are you doing?” Sam yelled, getting dangerously close to the barrel of Julia’s handgun.</p><p>“Back up, or I swear to God I’ll put a hole in your face,” she shouted back.</p><p>Walter took the scroll and put it into his metal briefcase. In his haste to get it squared away, he fumbled the large clay jar, sending it crashing to the floor. As it shattered, everyone instinctively took a step back. Priceless history was buried in the mess of clay fragments, and no one wanted to be the one to step on it.</p><p>A look of immense regret washed over Walter’s face, then was replaced by abject horror. For an instant, an impossibly bright light spilled out of the jar’s broken remains.</p><p>That can’t be good, Sam thought.</p><p>As the sound of the crash subsided, it was replaced by a furious scraping from the entrance lounge. As before, it set the whole room on edge. This time, however, the tumult didn’t subside after a few seconds. Instead, it got louder and louder and was punctuated by the sound of something heavy hitting wood, as if an increasingly agitated animal was outside and wanted in. Like a dog, Sam thought. Perfect.</p><p>“Jules?” Walter said.</p><p>She raised her pistol to cover the entrance.</p><p>“Nothing out there we can’t handle,” she said confidently.</p><p>This would be a good time to interrupt, Dean.</p><p>With Julia’s attention on the entrance lounge, Sam crouched and began to pick through the clay shards. As he flipped one over in his hands, he found a rough pattern engraved on what must have been the jar’s interior surface. A sigil, he realized. Angelic magic. And now it’s broken. Whatever had been contained by it was now free.</p><p>The scraping stopped, the sudden and profound silence perhaps even more disturbing than the grating noise of claws on wood. Sam’s foot brushed away clay fragments, freeing a path between him and the entrance. Before he could move, Eli’s hand gripped his shoulder. The man’s eyes were as wide as saucers, betraying his desperation. He didn’t want Sam to leave them.</p><p>Then the world seemed to fracture. Wind exploded into the room, swirling the curtains and kicking up dust from the splintered jar. A cluster of glass slivers blew past Sam’s head, others lodged painfully in his back and neck. Knocked forward by the blast, it was impossible to keep his balance. Sam landed with a thud in the pile of parchment and clay, immediately rolling off to protect what was left of the scrolls.</p><p>As he sat up, he saw the oddest sight—Dean, hanging by a thread outside the suite’s now-empty window frame, a rock salt shotgun hefted offensively through the opening. He had come through on his part of the plan, although he was a little behind schedule.</p><p>“Sorry ‘bout that. Windows are mirrored.” Despite the needling pain from the glass and rock salt, Sam was incredibly grateful his brother had shown up when he had. But the sense of relief was short-lived.</p><p>In the entrance lounge, the door pounded off its hinges, catching Julia off-guard and smashing her against the wall. Walter, briefcase in hand, spun and ran back into the main room, but he couldn’t outrun the beast outside, which quickly overtook him. Claws dug into his leg, pulling him backwards.</p><p>From the main room, all Sam could see was Walter’s face as he disappeared out the door.</p><p>“Little help here?” Dean called out, still hanging outside the window. Sam moved to the hole, but instead of dragging Dean in, he pulled the shotgun out of his brother’s hand and rushed after Walter.</p><p>When he reached the entrance lounge, Sam stopped in his tracks. Walter was pinned to the ground not by a Hellhound, but by the ill-kempt security guard, James. His unnaturally long nails were digging like claws into the biblical scholar’s leg, leaving jagged gashes behind.</p><p>Sam leveled the shotgun and let loose a rock salt shell. The spread hit James square in the chest, hammering him into the far wall. But before Walter could move, the security guard was back on him, his eyes pitch black. Sam’s finger pulled back on the trigger once more, but nothing happened.</p><p>Damn it. Out of shells.</p><p>“Help me!” Walter cried as James took another swipe at him, gouging at his face. The demon then used his grip to lift Walter and slam him into the nearby sofa. Blood splattered across the cream wallpaper and a portrait of Harry Truman that hung nearby.</p><p>James then dived at the metal briefcase that had been hidden under Walter’s body. As he scratched at the lock, Julia scrambled up behind him, her pistol raised.</p><p>The shot nearly deafened Sam, who was mere feet from the business end of the handgun as it fired. The bullet tore into James’s back, exiting through his right shoulder and leaving a trail of gore across the couch. His limp body slumped over the briefcase, but Sam knew it wouldn’t stay down for long.</p><p>It took a lot more than that to kill a demon.</p><p>“Hey. Ass-hat.”</p><p>Sam turned to see his brother clambering over the jagged glass left in the window frame. Dean lobbed a set of shells toward Sam, who caught them deftly and began loading.</p><p>“Drop your weapons!” a voice shouted forcefully from the hallway. Sam looked up to see a brace of rifles pointed at him, a pair of burly police officers holding them. They were addressing both Sam and Julia, who was still holding her pistol as she tended to her father.</p><p>Sam was faced with about a dozen choices. Surrender, run, fight, try to talk... but he chose none of them. Instead he froze in place, fearfully eyeing James’s now-stirring body. Julia, on the other hand, spun around immediately and put the policemen in her sights. Like it or not, they were going to assume that Sam was working with her. That left him no option—he had to run.</p><p>As the officers opened fire, he dived for cover. Thankfully, their aim was wide, shattering the wood frame of the archway between the lounge and the main room instead of Sam’s head.</p><p>“Sam!” Dean yelled, his voice worried. He was struggling to unhook himself from his harness. He had his switchblade out and was sawing roughly at the fraying straps.</p><p>The sound of gunfire had pushed the rest of the room’s occupants further into the corner—except one. Shochat cinched the wrappings on his hand tight and moved toward the broken jar at the chamber’s center. Scooping as many of the fragments as he could into his good hand, he deposited them gently in his jacket pocket. Behind him, Eli was squealing helplessly.</p><p>Sam heard the sound of Julia’s pistol firing several times, then she stumbled into the main room. Walter’s briefcase was firmly in her grasp as she headed for the window—and Dean.</p><p>“Will that hold two?” she demanded.</p><p>“What the eff, lady?” Dean snapped back, stepping away from her.</p><p>Seconds later, James barreled into the room, his face twisted into a canine snarl.</p><p>Behind him, the police officers stared in awe at the mortally wounded man bounding across the room. Their rifles dropped to their sides as James hurled himself into Julia, who in turn fell into Dean. The trio stumbled, off-balance, then toppled out of the open window.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Friggin’ demons! Dean’s thoughts screamed as the cold New York breeze rushed through his hair. With Julia gripped tightly to his side, he swung nearly fifteen feet out of the window before gravity whipped them back against the Waldorf s stone façade.</p><p>Under the combined weight of two people, Dean’s harness was near its breaking point. That he had started to saw through it a minute earlier certainly wasn’t helping. As they impacted the granite wall, Dean could feel Julia’s grip loosen. Given the circumstances, it wouldn’t be the end of the world if she fell, he reflected. Non-crazy ladies don’t bum-rush you next to an open window on the thirty-fifth floor.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Dean spotted James clinging to a small outcropping. Guy must be built, he thought. I sure as hell couldn’t hold on to that tiny ledge. That thought was short-lived, however, as James spun toward the suspended couple and flung himself at them. He was risking a long drop if he missed,which was a good possibility considering the strong winds.</p><p>He didn’t miss. Julia’s grip slackened even further as James impacted her. The two of them flailed desperately, further straining the integrity of Dean’s harness.</p><p>“Pull me up!” Dean shouted at the open window above them. A second later, a policeman’s head popped out, but he didn’t grab the rope. Instead, twelve stories above him, Dean clocked Marco watching in shock from the roof. “Marco! Pull!”</p><p>Then Dean’s attention was drawn to the demon clawing its way upward, toward the object Julia was still clutching in one hand—the metal briefcase.</p><p>“He’s after the case! Drop it!” Dean urged, but Julia ignored him. Instead, she kicked at James, trying to dislodge him. The frayed rope connected to Dean’s harness began to twist apart, the strands snapping one by one.</p><p>“Drop it or we all die!” he yelled. Julia locked eyes with Dean, and he could see how torn she was. Guess that scroll’s just as important to them as it is to us.</p><p>“You can’t read it if you’re a corpse!” Dean asserted desperately.</p><p>Reluctantly, she held the case away from her body, as if she was about to let it drop. James dug his fingers into Dean’s legs, using them to push off toward the briefcase.</p><p>That guy’s suicidal, Dean thought. Oh wait—demon.</p><p>James thrashed through the air, grabbing the case tight and wrenching it out of Julia’s hand.</p><p>Both demon and briefcase plummeted toward the city street below.</p><p>Dean looked down at Julia, who was still barely clinging to his harness. Even with both hands free, she wouldn’t last much longer.</p><p>“You’re a crazy bitch, you know that?” he declared.</p><p>No one had noticed Eli’s exit. As the big guy’s partner dangled out of the window with the lady and the briefcase, Eli had taken the opportunity to leave the premises. He prided himself on recognizing opportunities as they presented themselves, and the opportunity to survive was an enticing one.</p><p>Upon exiting the Waldorf Astoria, Eli was thrust into a large crowd that had gathered around the security guard’s fallen body. The taxi cab the guy had landed on was totaled, its engine compartment several inches shorter than it had been a minute earlier. The sight of his body was sickening. It was as if he’d been hit by a freight train—every part of him smashed into an unrecognizable mess. Fully half of the assembled people couldn’t take their eyes off the gruesome display, while the other half gawked at the theatrics taking place 300 feet above, where the two idiots still swung perilously.</p><p>What no one seemed to notice was the steel briefcase that had landed a dozen yards from the demolished taxi.</p><p>What a day the Lord has made, Eli mused, as he casually picked up the briefcase and disappeared into the bustle of New York City.</p><p>Inside the Presidential Suite, chaos reigned. Sam had nearly jumped out of the window after his brother, but was quickly restrained by the two policemen. The room was in shambles, with broken clay, glass and furniture littering the floor. Mr. Feldman tried to relate what had happened to the officers as they cleared the adjacent rooms, but none of them could explain how the security guard had come back to life after apparently being fatally shot. It was nearly a minute before anyone else realized that Dean and Julia were still hanging outside the window.</p><p>“Everyone get back,” the older policeman ordered. “We have this under control.” The officer leaned his head out of the window and tried half-heartedly to grab the taut rope that they were dangling from.</p><p>I have to get to the roof, Sam realized. If they pull him in here, we’re going to be stuck in prison until the Apocalypse.</p><p>As the other policeman was occupied with trying to radio a dispatcher, Sam’s opportunity to escape had arrived. Leaving the main room, Sam saw Walter crawling toward the exit. He considered what Walter had said about the War Scroll: If the wrong people get their hands on it... Well, that would be bad. What were the chances that Sam and Walter were on the same side? Despite strong impulses to the contrary, Sam decided not to abandon the guy. Slinging a hand under the injured man’s arm, Sam quickly had him out of the suite and to the bank of elevators.</p><p>“Thank you...” Walter managed to gasp, his breath ragged.</p><p>“Don’t.” Sam didn’t want gratitude from the man until he had decided what to do with him. Entering the elevator, he pressed the button for the forty-seventh floor.</p><p>“Down,” Walter wheezed. “We need to get to the street.”</p><p>“Your daughter is hanging by a thread, Walter. You’re just going to abandon her?”</p><p>“She is? She’s alive?”</p><p>“Not if we don’t pull her up to the roof quick.”</p><p>They exited the elevator and worked their way up the service stairwell as fast as Walter’s damaged legs allowed. On the roof, they found a stocky, swarthy man already trying to reel in Dean and Julia.</p><p>“What in God’s creation is going on down there?” the man asked, nodding at Walter’s torn-up legs.</p><p>Sam searched for the words to explain what had just happened. As usual, the exploits of the Winchester brothers were beyond rationalization.</p><p>“Communists,” he said decisively. It was the best he could do.</p><p>“Help me lift them up.”</p><p>By that point, the rest of the window washers strapped to the side of the Waldorf Astoria had stopped working and directed their full attention to Dean and Julia. Dean had started to wall-walk horizontally away from the open window of the Presidential Suite. Sam noted at least three sets of uniformed arms reaching out of the window, indicating that backup had arrived. Won’t be long before they think to come up here, he surmised.</p><p>The mechanism for raising the suspended window washers was little more than a hand crank attached to the system of pulleys and levers. The man leaned into the crank with all his weight, but couldn’t get it to turn. Sam moved to help him, adding his strength to the guy’s considerable heft. Between the two of them, they got the crank to turn, but very slowly. It would take at least ten minutes to pull Dean and Julia up at that rate.</p><p>“Little help Walter?” Sam asked, but he could see Walter was in no shape to exert himself. His skin was pale from the blood loss. All of his energy was dedicated just to remaining upright.</p><p>“This gear ain’t designed for two,” the Italian stated.</p><p>Glancing around the roof, Sam tried to come up with another option. If he could tell which room Dean was outside of now, he could break the window and pull him inside. Of course, the police were just as likely to come up with that plan, and they were a lot closer to Dean.</p><p>“How long’s the rope?” Sam asked as mental gears clicked into place.</p><p>“Long.”</p><p>“Long enough to lower them to the ground?” The man mulled that for a beat, examining the thick coil of rope. “Should be.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t reassured but he knew they didn’t have another choice. He nodded and the two of them began rapidly unspooling the line. At ground level, a cluster of police cruisers had assembled at the 50th Street entrance.</p><p>Either way, up or down, I’m handing Dean over to the cops. Better that than waiting for him to fall, Sam thought, continuing to turn the crank.</p><p>When roughly half the line had been let out, a shotgun blast echoed between the buildings. Sam peered over the edge and saw Dean scrambling through an open window— presumably one he had just broken with the other shotgun in his duffel.</p><p>“Change of plans,” Sam called out to Walter, who was leaning woozily against the railing. “We’re going to the subway.”</p><p>Dean had chosen the window at random. That the room belonged to an attractive Asian woman was mere happy coincidence. That she was drying off after a shower had to be, in Dean’s opinion, God’s cosmic reward to him for saving Julia’s life. If there is a God, the logical half of Dean’s brain chimed in. All signs point to absentee Father.</p><p>Unfortunately, the situation demanded that Dean hurry along. Though if cell phone numbers had existed in 1954, he certainly would have left his.</p><p>Dean decided that the stairwell was less of a risk than the elevator. Skipping two steps at a time, he practically galloped down the stairs, his duffel jostling on his back. Julia kept up the pace despite everything her body had just been put through. When they reached the bottom floor, Dean knew they’d have to switch stairwells—and that meant going through the lobby.</p><p>“Do you know where you’re going?” Julia demanded.</p><p>Dean’s snort was his only response.</p><p>“Because if you don’t, I’d just as soon go my own way.”</p><p>“You and me both, sugar. But if you want to get out of here a free woman, the only way is my way.” That seemed to shut her up, for the time being. “From the look of things, you royally jacked our plan back there.”</p><p>“Likewise.”</p><p>“Hey! I saved your ass. Without me, you’d be just another spot of bird poop to clean off the sidewalk.”</p><p>Julia opened her mouth to respond, but no words came out.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s right. What have you done for me, ‘sides throwing me out of a window? I knew you were trouble the minute I saw you.”</p><p>“You wanted to sleep with me the minute you saw me,” Julia shot back.</p><p>‘But I didn’t. Because you looked like trouble.” They had arrived at the bottom floor, where a myriad voices were audible outside the stairwell door.</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Julia scowled. “You’re the one who’s ranting,” she hissed.</p><p>Timing their dash perfectly, Dean and Julia were able to slip into the Park Avenue lobby unnoticed. Most everyone had hurried outside after hearing that a man had jumped. Dean held open the door to the garage-access stairwell— but Julia was no longer behind him. Scouring the lobby, he clocked her walking toward the main entrance.</p><p>“You trying to get yourself arrested?” Dean asked as he caught up with her.</p><p>She turned to face him, now ice cold.</p><p>“I need what’s in that briefcase. You have no idea how important it is.”</p><p>“You’ve got it all backwards. I need that scroll. You don’t know how important it is. But neither of us is gonna go out there after it.”</p><p>“You can’t stop me.”</p><p>Dean leaned in intimately close. “If you’re going to go out there, at least tell me you still have your gun.”</p><p>Julia reached down to her waist, but the pistol wasn’t there. She looked mournfully out on to the street where it had fallen.</p><p>“Thought so. Let’s get one thing straight—I’m not helping you get away. You know things about the scroll, and I need to know those things too. You’re my prisoner.”</p><p>Slapping the side of his duffel, Dean smirked.</p><p>“Now unless you want to get an ass full of rock salt, how about you follow me?”</p><p>The Presidential Siding was a custom-built underground train station, constructed to allow Presidents, dignitaries and celebrities direct access to the Waldorf Astoria. Their train cars could pull directly up to the hotel, bypassing the need to secure Grand Central Terminal, or sit in New York traffic. Most of the time, the rail siding sat unused, which made it perfect for their getaway.</p><p>By the time Sam and Walter made it to the rail platform, Dean and Julia were already there. Sam wasn’t overjoyed to see Julia again after her actions upstairs, but watching the tender moment she shared with her father helped take the edge off the hostility.</p><p>“You okay, Dean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I will be, soon as we get out of here.”</p><p>Walter steadied himself against the platform wall.</p><p>“I’m almost afraid to ask, but are we meant to cross this?” He pointed at the vast expanse of tracks in front of them. Since they were underground, with almost no lighting, the tracks seemed to extend forever. A steady stream of trains was moving in and out of the area. The mayhem of Grand Central Terminal was just audible over the din of the engines.</p><p>“That’s the idea,” Sam answered. “Before anybody thinks to look down here.”</p><p>Julia’s eyes caught on her father’s pant leg, which was dripping with blood.</p><p>“He can’t dodge a train like that,” she said.</p><p>Dean pumped his shotgun with conviction. He threw the duffel at Sam.</p><p>“He doesn’t have to dodge one. He’s got to catch one,” he said.</p><p>The group made their way across the tracks in silence, none of them comfortable with their new-found fellowship. Sam noticed that Dean kept his shotgun leveled at Julia the whole time, which was probably a smart move. Even if they were playing for the same team, Julia had been a little too gung-ho during her aborted heist. He also still wondered if she had been the one to swipe the knife.</p><p>With some difficulty, they were able to hoist Walter onto the back of a south-bound train. For the first time in hours, Sam relaxed. They had completely failed in their mission, but somehow, they had survived. Seated across from him, Dean looked glum.</p><p>“What is it?” Sam asked.</p><p>Rubbing the train’s shoddy upholstery with distaste, Dean sighed.</p><p>“I miss the Impala.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-16">CHAPTER 16</span><a href="#chapter-16" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>James McMannon felt as if a heavy burden was lifting off his back. A white light appeared before him, and he wanted to go toward it.</p><p>There was an eruption of noise.</p><p>The light disappeared. James forced his eyes open. In front of him, he could see a wavering group of people—they looked like they were in an enormous, swirling heat devil— as if they were caught in the hot air that rose off the black streets of the city in the middle of summer.</p><p>He heard a voice in his left ear.</p><p>“Hey. Stay still, the ambulance is coming.”</p><p>James thought he was answering to the voice, but he realized that all he could hear was ringing. Then he saw that white light again. He got up, at least he thought he did, and walked toward its beckoning glimmer.</p><p>At that moment, everything that James McMannon had every thought, felt, or loved left his body.</p><p>All that was left was the animal.</p><p>In all of Hank Caprezie’s years on the force, he had never seen a man fall thirty floors and live, but here he was. And he was one of the family, a security guard.</p><p>“Are you sure you’re okay?” Hank peered into the guy’s eyes. “You need to go to the hospital, stay still.”</p><p>Without responding, the man slid himself off the crushed taxi. Standing in the middle of the crowd, he looked around, as though searching for something. His neck was at an unnatural angle, which he corrected by grasping it on both sides and twisting his head back into place. When he turned back to Hank, his eyes were pitch black. Hank took an involuntary step back.</p><p>“Hey man, I really think you should stay!” Hank called.</p><p>The guy didn’t listen. Instead, he walked toward the throng of people and disappeared.</p><p>I’m going to have a hell of a time explaining this to the captain, Hank thought.</p><p>Dean spent the train ride trying to interrogate Walter and Julia. Unfortunately for him, they weren’t talking. It was clear they knew much more about the scrolls than Walter had let on in his meeting with Sam, but their motivations were still hazy. Do they want to protect the scrolls, or destroy them? Dean wondered. It was possible that they were all on the same side, working toward the exact same goal, but without more information from Walter and Julia, Dean had no way of knowing.</p><p>When the group got off the train in lower Manhattan, the bleeding from Walter’s leg had slowed, but he was still in need of a doctor’s care. They looked at one another. They didn’t have the scrolls, nor any idea how to find them. They had reached an impasse.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean, his feelings obvious. It’s time to go.</p><p>Just like that, the Winchesters turned and started walking uptown.</p><p>“You’re just going to leave us here?” Julia cried. “I thought I was your prisoner?”</p><p>Dean turned on his heel. “I release you. And from what I can tell, sweet cheeks, you’ll do fine on your own. Both of you.”</p><p>“You’re going to need us,” Julia called as Walter faltered a step. Sam’s face registered a slight flash of sympathy. What Julia really meant, of course, was that she needed them. Are we really going to leave a bleeding old man on the street, especially if his daughter might be in possession of our stolen knife?</p><blockquote><p>Dean punched him in the shoulder. “Let’s get going.” Apparently, they were.</p></blockquote><p>That evening, Sam and Dean checked into a dive hotel on the Lower East Side. With all the chaos they had caused at the Waldorf that day, it was too much of a risk to go back to the apartment, even if they had used aliases. They bought a pizza and took it back to their room. Despite their exhaustion, they still had to eat, and neither of them was in the mood for the human interaction a restaurant visit would require.</p><p>Sam wondered how much Walter and Julia really knew. It seemed likely now that they had been the ones to ransack the Villard House apartment, and Walter had spoken at length about the scrolls at the Bible Society. But did they know the true significance of the War Scroll? Could they possibly comprehend how important it was for Sam and Dean to take possession of it?</p><p>Neither of them knew any of the answers. All they knew was that in the morning, they’d come up with a new plan. Until then, they’d eat pizza and bask in the hopelessness of their cause.</p><p>Long past nightfall, Dean stepped out onto the building’s front stoop. Sam was already there, staring quietly at the black sky.</p><p>“Can’t see stars for shit here,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam’s lips curled into a half-smile—the one he reserved for Dean’s attempts to cheer him up.</p><p>“I hadn’t noticed.”</p><p>“Good work today, Sammy.”</p><p>“Good work? We got hosed, Dean. We had to run away with our tails between our legs, and now we don’t even have a clue where the scroll is. For all we know, it really was destroyed.”</p><p>“You kept it together in there. Me, I wouldn’t have taken well to Julia barging in like that.”</p><p>Sam nodded. Then, after a moment’s silence, said, “Dean... is that a shotgun down your pants?”</p><p>Seemingly out of nowhere, Dean produced the shotgun, then hid it once more down the back of his jeans.</p><p>“After everything, I wanted to keep it handy. But I don’t want to get arrested for firearm possession after what we got away with today.”</p><p>“Actually, I think the only real crime was destruction of property,” Sam said, thinking back.</p><p>“Plus breaking and entering.”</p><p>“And resisting arrest.”</p><p>“And assault with a deadly weapon.”</p><p>Sam’s brow furrowed in confusion. “When was that? I didn’t shoot anybody that wasn’t a demon.”</p><p>Dean smirked. “I shot you.”</p><p>That was enough to get a small laugh out of Sam.</p><p>“Sorry about that, by the way.”</p><p>Sam reached for his neck, where tiny bits of glass and rock salt were no doubt still embedded.</p><p>“No, Dean, I’m the one who should be sorry.”</p><p>“Hey now, let’s not start with this. One ‘I’m sorry’ is the daily limit.”</p><p>“I’m serious. I’m sorry I brought us here. We didn’t know what we were getting into, and now...”</p><p>“Now we’re stuck, is that what you’re getting at?”</p><p>“Maybe. What if Don leaves us here to rot, chasing after a scroll that doesn’t exist?”</p><p>“No angel douche is gonna leave me stranded with the Cleavers. We’ll find a way, Sam. I promise you that.”</p><p>They sat quietly for a minute, then Sam said hesitantly, “Am I a coward?”</p><p>Dean didn’t know how to respond to that. In the end he just said, “No.”</p><p>“I mean, if it was you. If you knew the fight could be won, and all it took was your life—“</p><p>“That’s not all it takes, Sam.”</p><p>Sam nodded, but Dean could tell he wasn’t satisfied.</p><p>“That’s not all it takes. You saying ‘yes’ to Lucifer isn’t just about giving up your life, it’s about giving up everything. Letting the angels have their way with the Earth, with what’s rightfully ours. Sam, if I could say ‘yes’ to Michael and end this here and now, I would in an instant, but we both know it ain’t that simple.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean saying ‘yes.’ I meant...”</p><p>“What? Out with it.”</p><p>“I don’t know. Nevermind.”</p><p>“You’re tired. We both are. Get some rest, it’ll make more sense in the morning.”</p><p>When Dean reached the door, he looked back at his brother, still seated on the front steps. In so many ways, Sam would forever be the little boy that Dean had spent his entire youth protecting. A familiar fear raced through his mind. The same fear that had plagued him for months. More than anything else, Dean feared that Sam wasn’t strong enough.</p><p>He feared that, when the time came, Sam would say “Yes.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-17">CHAPTER 17</span><a href="#chapter-17" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam didn’t want to dream. He cherished the opportunity to sleep—it was the dreams that were the problem. After what he’d seen and experienced as a hunter, any therapist would expect his slumbering visions to be horrific—monsters, demons, death and dismemberment—but any of those things would be welcome in place of what he did dream about. Family. His brother, his father, even his mother, who had died before he could walk. They were the figures that filled his dreams, living happy lives, untouched by the dark plans of Azazel, Lilith, and Lucifer.</p><p>Untouched by Sam’s own actions. Breaking the Final Seal. The Apocalypse. The End of Everything. For months on end, the dreams were the same. The Winchester family sitting around a dinner table telling mundane stories about their small problems. Normal problems. Dean was younger, maybe seventeen years old, not yet the independent adult man he was in 2010. John was a mechanic, working long hours, but relishing every moment of it. Mary was... alive. What else mattered? Almost everything was exactly how Sam had imagined it as a child, while sitting alone in dank motel rooms waiting for John to come back from a hunt.</p><p>The only difference? Sam wasn’t there. Their perfect life was only possible because he didn’t exist. No Sam meant no yellow-eyed demon coming in the night, no fire destroying the house, no death sentence for Mary. No need for John’s twenty-year path to revenge. No meeting Jessica, no reason for her to become Azazel’s next victim. Sam couldn’t close his eyes without seeing it. Somewhere out there, Jessica could have been happy and alive without him.</p><p>Sam didn’t want to dream. Simple unconsciousness suited him much better.</p><p>In the morning, Sam and Dean gathered what little stuff they had with them and headed out. They decided that Sam would try to get back into the American Bible Society to see if he could find any information in Walter’s office. Meanwhile Dean was going to try to track down James the demon security guard. If he really was a ‘guard dog,’ he might lead them straight to the scrolls.</p><p>Sneaking into the American Bible Society was relatively straightforward. The rear entrance was locked, but Sam used one of his credit cards and picked it with ease. That’s an advantage of working in 1954, Sam thought. They’re not as paranoid about security. He briefly considered the possibility that the police hadn’t yet been to Walter’s workplace, but that was unlikely. Mr. Feldman knew Walter’s real name— indeed it was probably his distinction in the field that had convinced Mr. Feldman to let him bid in the first place.</p><p>Entering the busy maze of small passageways at the back of the building, it was nearly impossible to avoid encountering people. Luckily, every scholar he passed had their nose in a book.</p><p>Still, got to move fast.</p><p>Reaching Walter’s office, Sam found the place in chaos. Books littered the floor, a massive shelf was upended and resting at an angle across Walter’s desk, and his typewriter had been smashed to pieces.</p><p>Sam swung the door closed, hoping that no one would be curious enough to come looking through the ransacked room.</p><p>From behind a bookcase, he heard a voice.</p><p>“Don’t come any closer!”</p><p>Walter peeked over the edge of the fallen furniture.</p><p>“Sam?”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Sam asked.</p><p>“It’s my office,” Walter said, emerging and looking around. “Or at least it was my office.”</p><p>Sam noticed that he had clean pants on but was still struggling to put weight on his right leg particularly.</p><p>“Who did this?” Sam asked. “Cops?”</p><p>Walter shook his head. “The police came and went yesterday afternoon, according to one of my colleagues. This must have happened during the night.”</p><p>“So you made some friends yesterday,” Sam said.</p><p>“It would seem so.” Walter opened the notebook that he was holding. “Anyway, I couldn’t sleep last night. I’ve been here since four. I keep seeing that... thing.”</p><p>“James—the security guard?”</p><p>“That thing wasn’t a person. Doesn’t deserve to be called a person’s name. What about you? What are you doing here?”</p><p>Sam perched on the edge of the ruined desk.</p><p>“What do you know about demonology, Walter?”</p><p>The scholar swallowed, grimacing.</p><p>“It’s part of the Christian faith.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And I’ve read the Bible. I’ve read all the apocryphal texts. I know what they say about demons, I just—“</p><p>“Didn’t think you’d ever see one?” Sam offered.</p><p>Walter avoided Sam’s gaze. “My colleagues call this sort of talk ‘occult’—‘hidden,’ out of the ordinary man’s view. How is it that you know so much about it, Sam?”</p><p>“You could say I’m a bit of a scholar, like you. I just go about my research a little differently. More ‘hands on.’”</p><p>“So how does one kill a demon?” Walter asked.</p><p>Sam remembered Ruby’s knife, which was the quickest way of dispatching a demon. Has Julia got it? he wondered again. If Sam told Walter the knife’s purpose, it was possible he and Julia would go after James without Sam and Dean’s help. It seemed sensible to keep some information hidden.</p><p>Don’t give Walter too much rope. Or he could strangle you with it.</p><p>“There are ways,” Sam finally replied.</p><p>Nodding, Walter flipped his sketch over so Sam could see it. In broad gray strokes, Walter had laid out the basic shape of a hellish-looking canine creature, its snarling teeth dripping with blood. It uncannily resembled the mental picture Sam had of a Hellhound.</p><p>“Not drawing a kids’ book, huh?”</p><p>“For a second, while it was attacking me, I could swear it...” Walter stopped, collecting his thoughts. “I could swear it changed. Became something else.” He tapped the drawing with the pencil. “This.”</p><p>Now it was Sam who was confused.</p><p>“What do you mean, like a shifter?” He caught himself, remembering that Walter wouldn’t have a clue that shapeshifters existed. “I mean, did it physically change shape? Grow fur?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. I was distracted by all the scratching and biting.”</p><p>Sam took the notebook from Walter, squinting closely at the hellish image.</p><p>“I take it that’s not the typical demon’s M.O.?” Walter asked.</p><p>“No. Not at all.” What the hell kind of creature was this—could it be a Hellhound?</p><p>“You recognize it?”</p><p>Images of Lilith’s white eyes flitted through Sam’s memory.</p><p>“Kind of,” Sam said. “Do any of your books ever mention Hellhounds?”</p><p>Walter shook his head, no.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising, given the mythological nature of the beasts. Their connection to Christian theology was tenuous at best.</p><p>“You’ve run into one before?” Walter asked.</p><p>“We’ve run into a lot of things.”</p><p>As Sam pondered the possibilities, he realized a particularly dire one. In 1954, Lilith was still alive, probably roaming the earth, eating babies, as was her wont. Could she, or the yellow-eyed demon for that matter, be involved with this strange creature? Sam decided it was worth giving Walter a few more scraps of information.</p><p>“Hellhounds are brutal, fearless creatures. They’re Hell’s enforcers.”</p><p>“What, like, if you make a deal with the Devil?” Walter joked.</p><p>“Yes. Exactly.”</p><p>Walter blanched. “Oh.”</p><p>“The last time we saw one, it was obeying a very powerful demon named Lilith. She’s actually the reason we’re in this situation—“ Sam stopped when he saw the strange look on Walter’s face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Lilith?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“The demon Lilith, the first demon, Lilith.”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“You’ve met her?” Walter asked, his voice excited.</p><p>“I killed her,” Sam answered. Well, more or less.</p><p>For a second Walter was silent. Then he rubbed his hands over his notebook as he began to speak, half to himself, as though talking through a math problem.</p><p>“There’s lore about Lilith, you know. That she has a demonic dog as a companion.” Walter eyed Sam. “I may have never seen a demon, but I know my Bible, and it seems like that could be what nearly took my leg off yesterday.”</p><p>“It may have a dog’s bite, but it looked like a regular guy,” Sam said.</p><p>“Young man, we are talking about thousands of years of human history. Where Lucifer, demons and angels all inhabited the same dark universe. I would think those entities could think up whatever they damn well wanted to.”</p><p>Sam nodded, he knew that all too well.</p><p>“Do you know what it says? The War of the Sons?” Sam pressed.</p><p>“If I did, I wouldn’t need to steal it.”</p><p>“How do you know it’s important enough to steal without knowing what it says?” Sam persisted. “I mean, why were you after the War Scroll specifically, and not the rest of the set?”</p><p>“The rest of the Dead Sea Scrolls are phenomenally important, just not in the same way,” Walter said, bypassing Sam’s first question.</p><p>“Walter, you and I went through something yesterday that would send most people running for the hills, but here we both are. It seems as if we might be after the same thing. Either we can share information, or—“</p><p>“Live together, die alone?” Walter interrupted. “We don’t trust you. Julia nor me.”</p><p>“Well, no offense Walter, but we trust you two even less, and for better reasons,” Sam said. “So what do you know about the scrolls?”</p><p>Walter sighed. He seemed to contemplate his next sentence very carefully. “I know the War Scroll is important, because... because I’ve been waiting for it my entire life.”</p><p>“What, like you were destined to find it?”</p><p>“I don’t have a destiny,” Walter said. “All I had was a mother, who told me a story when I was little, the same one every night. A story about the day that good would finally triumph over evil, and how if I was lucky, I’d get to see that day.” Sam leaned forward, intrigued. “And if I was very, very lucky, I’d get to be a part of that battle.”</p><p>Sam’s jaw clenched. “Doesn’t sound that lucky to me.”</p><p>“The War Scroll is how good triumphs in that final battle. It’s a set of instructions, written thousands of years ago, by incredibly devout Jews during Roman rule in Judea. The Essenes spent their days in solitude, transcribing the Word of God. Some believe they were His prophets.”</p><p>“And you believe it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I never knew my mother to lie to me.”</p><p>Sam knew all about destiny, and about the weight of a parent’s expectations. It seemed as if Walter had allowed himself to be pushed down the path his mother had planned for him.</p><p>“Walter, I think we can help each other,” Sam said softly. “Why don’t you gather your stuff and come with me?”</p><p>“Right, my things...” Walter absently drummed his fingers on the notebook with the sort of deep deliberation that Sam didn’t see very often. Not from Dean, anyway.</p><p>“Wait,” Walter said suddenly, his eyes wide. He hastily pushed aside a pile of dusty tomes, revealing a much larger work underneath. It was roughly ten inches by twelve, set in a thick leather cover. As Walter flipped the yellowed pages, Sam could see they were filled with Enochian, the language of the angels. “Pages are missing,” Walter said, in despair. “Without them, I won’t be able to translate the scroll.”</p><p>“If the pages are gone, we’ll just have to—“</p><p>“No,” Walter said, voice filled with new hope, “I don’t think they would have found it.”</p><p>He led Sam through a small door in the back of the office.</p><p>“It’s in the toilet?” Sam said, seeing the tiny private bathroom.</p><p>Walter smiled broadly as he fumbled through a rack of magazines. Hidden amongst them was another ancient volume, with the thickness of a dictionary. If its cover once held a title, it had long since faded.</p><p>“You keep that in the pisser?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-18">CHAPTER 18</span><a href="#chapter-18" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Slipping into one of his most-often used aliases, an FBI agent, Dean visited the 51^st^ Precinct and got James’s last known address. His sister’s house in Queens. Great.</p><p>Dean hopped onto the subway and made the twenty-minute journey to the outer borough.</p><p>Burnt-out candles covered the front steps of the McMannon residence. Dean wondered if the vigil was for James, or if there was something else going on that he didn’t yet understand.</p><p>Knocking on the front door, Dean again pulled out his FBI badge. The woman who eventually opened the door looked battered and used up, her days-old makeup was smeared down her face. She had clearly spent the night weeping.</p><p>“Sorry to disturb you, ma’am,” Dean said kindly. “I’m Agent Page with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.”</p><p>The woman wiped a little mascara from the corner of her eye. “You’d better come in.”</p><p>The woman led him inside, where he found Julia sat on the living room couch, smiling like a wolf.</p><p>The woman introduced herself as Mrs. Doyle. “And this is Miss Sands,” she added, nodding at Julia. “The police sent her to visit me and check on my well-being. But I expect you’d know all about that.”</p><p>“I’m not sure, Madam,” Dean said, raising an eyebrow at Julia. “It seems strange that they would send such a young lady to do such an important job.”</p><p>“Oh, I know,” Mrs. Doyle said. “But she has been very kind.”</p><p>Julia glared at Dean. Ignoring her, Dean looked around the dark and pokey interior of Mrs. Doyle’s home—it was stuffed floor-to-ceiling with religious icons. The deep irony struck Dean immediately. The world could be cruel.</p><p>Dean took a seat opposite Julia. She had beaten him here. Somehow. Dean didn’t like how the day was going.</p><p>“Can I offer you a cup of tea?” Mrs. Doyle said, shuffling in from the kitchen.</p><p>Dean smiled politely and took the saucer and cup from her.</p><p>“Would you mind telling me when you last saw James McMannon?”</p><p>“I’ve already told the detectives everything I know,” she mumbled in reply. “He left with Barney to go to work, and neither of them came home that night.”</p><p>“Barney?” Dean asked.</p><p>“... My son.”</p><p>“Of course,” Dean replied gently, feeling for the woman. He was certain her son was already dead. “But James reported for work the next day?”</p><p>Mrs. Doyle broke eye contact with Dean, and began turning a Saint Christopher medallion over in her hands. “Yes.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a suspicious look. “Madam, have you been in contact with James?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“The only way we can find your son is if we know everything,” Dean persisted gently.</p><p>Mrs. Doyle recoiled in horror, her lip quivering intensely. She looked like she was on the verge of total emotional collapse.</p><p>“But...”</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“How could you not know? The detectives, they found...” she trailed off, tears spilling freely down her face. “They found his body.”</p><p>Smooth, Dean. Although Sam was the more emotionally sensitive of the Winchester brothers, Dean’s heart wasn’t made of stone. Mrs. Doyle had lost everything she had, and it was already too late for Dean to help her. After the gunshot wound and the fall that James had sustained, his host wouldn’t survive once the demon left his body. To all intents and purposes, James was just as dead as Barney.</p><p>“I’m very sorry, Mrs. Doyle,” Dean said sincerely. “Of course, had I known...”</p><p>“You wouldn’t be wasting your time talking to me,” the woman finished.</p><p>“That’s not true,” Dean said. “I’ve still got some questions about James.”</p><p>Mrs. Doyle’s face went even whiter, but she nodded okay.</p><p>“He ever come home acting strangely? Like he was drunk, or not himself?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“He hang out with any shady characters? People that weren’t so... wholesome?” he asked, pointing at the largest crucifix in the room.</p><p>“He’s a good man.”</p><p>“You don’t think it’s possible he’s involved with this?”</p><p>“He’s a victim. I know it. Both of them are.”</p><p>“Did James go to church with you, Mrs. Doyle?”</p><p>She nodded, hesitantly.</p><p>“But not every week,” Dean stated flatly.</p><p>“Some Sundays he’d have work.”</p><p>Julia leaned in and grasped the woman’s shaking hands.</p><p>“It’s terrible this has happened to your family, Mrs. Doyle. But if James was here this morning, then you need to tell the agent.”</p><p>Where’s she getting that from? Dean wondered. Was he missing something obvious here?</p><p>Mrs. Doyle faltered under Julia’s scrutiny.</p><p>“He didn’t do anything wrong, I just know it. Please don’t hurt him.”</p><p>I’ll be damned, Dean thought. Julia’s good for something after all.</p><p>“Was he here? Did he say anything?” Julia continued her grilling.</p><p>“No. He didn’t say much at all... That was the strange part. He came in, looking a real mess, went upstairs. I heard him shuffling around. Then he came back down and did something, I don’t know, not like him.”</p><p>“What?” Dean asked.</p><p>“He asked if I knew how to get to the train station. But that’s not how he said it. It was like he didn’t know the word he was looking for.”</p><p>“And why is that strange?” Julia queried, moving forward in her seat.</p><p>“Well, because he worked at Grand Central Station for fifteen years as a desk clerk. How could he not know where it was?”</p><p>Julia and Dean exchanged glances. That was strange indeed.</p><p>“That was before you heard from the detective?” Julia asked.</p><p>Mrs. Doyle nodded sadly. “I don’t know where he’s going. I just don’t want him to get hurt.” She looked at Dean desperately. “Promise me you won’t hurt him.”</p><p>“We just want to bring your brother back. That’s all.” If only that were true.</p><p>Dean followed Julia out of the dimly lit house and into the bright morning sun in a somber mood. Whatever the demon’s interest in the scroll, it was clear he was willing to kill.</p><p>“How the hell did you get here before me?” he demanded as soon as they were out of earshot of the house. “And what the hell are you doing?”</p><p>Julia accelerated her pace, leaving Dean struggling to keep up.</p><p>“Hey! I’m talking to you,” Dean said, grabbing her elbow.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Julia asked spinning around angrily. “You stop us from getting the scrolls, then you come barging in on my interview. You’re like a bull dressed in heels in a china shop. Skidding around, and breaking everything in its wake.”</p><p>“You’d never find me in heels.” Dean said, scowling. Then he smiled. “Listen, it’s clear we’re both after the same thing. And even though you’re obnoxious, it seems to me we’d be better off working together.”</p><p>“I get the jump on you one time and you want to team up?”</p><p>“I don’t need your help. I just don’t want to have to kill you.”</p><p>“Why should I team up with you? I’m always ahead of you, Dean Winchester.” Julia smiled, holding up Dean’s wallet. “And here I’ve been writing my love letters to Malcolm Young...”</p><p>Dean felt his jacket for his wallet.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me,” he gasped. “Impressive. Not very many women can dip like that.”</p><p>“I’m not most women. That FBI shield is a piece of crap, by the way, totally unrealistic.” Julia stopped in front of the steps leading up to the raised subway platform.</p><p>“So what do you say? Partners?” Even as he said the words, Dean knew he was going to have trouble convincing Sam. Even though his brother was always the more trusting of the two, knowing Sam, he wouldn’t want other people to get hurt finding their way out of this mess.</p><p>Julia surveyed Dean. “I guess. For now.” She turned and took the stairs two at a time.</p><p>“Hey, how did you know?” Dean asked, following her.</p><p>“Know what?”</p><p>“That James had been there.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? The whole place smelled like wet dog.”</p><p>Dean pushed coins into the payphone on the subway platform. He waited for the operator and then asked for the Turtle Bay hotel, room thirty-three. Dean listened as the desk clerk rang up to the third floor. In that era, it seemed some hotels only had one telephone per level. Through the receiver, Dean heard his brother’s heavy footfall as he approached.</p><p>“Dean? What’s going on?”</p><p>“Meet me at Grand Central. The guard dog is taking a train today. Don’t know where or what time.”</p><p>“When are you going to get there?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Soon as I can. I’m at 111th street in Queens. Oh, and Sam? I might have company.”</p><p>“Um... I was going to say the same thing,” Sam admitted. “Walter was at his office. He has a book, and some ideas about what is possessing James.”</p><p>“Fair enough. Julia got to James’s sister before I did. Anyway, we’ll meet you at Grand Central.”</p><p>Sam hung up and retreated back to the room where Walter was rewrapping his injured leg with clean gauze.</p><p>“We’ve got to meet Julia and Dean at Grand Central.”</p><p>Walter looked up, surprised. “Grand Central? Is that where the scrolls are?”</p><p>“Seems guard dog James is taking a train ride. We need to follow him, he’s our only lead.”</p><p>“Well then, let’s go.”</p><p>Sam stuffed the shotguns into the bottom of the duffel bag and put his and Dean’s 2010 clothes on top. They’d used the clothes to conceal the shape of the weapons in the bag on their way to the Waldorf, which turned out to be fortuitous, since they hadn’t been able to return to their apartment. Walter had taken a small suitcase from his office. It was empty, but could hold the scrolls when and if they found them.</p><p>“How much money do you have?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Not much. Three dollars.” Walter said, looking through his worn leather wallet.</p><p>Sam looked at the window and the fire escape beyond it. They were going to have to hoof it out the back. There was no telling who was watching the hotel. Plus, Sam didn’t want to pay for two nights. He opened up the creeky, dust-laden window. Down below, a large dumpster was about twenty feet too far away from them. It was going to be difficult getting an old man with a leg injury out of the window.</p><p>“I can make it,” Walter reassured Sam.</p><p>The two men scrambled down the fire escape to the platform that hung about twenty-five feet in the air. Sam was six-foot four—that meant he still had to drop nineteen feet to the ground. He hit the uneven pavement hard.</p><p>“You okay?” Walter called.</p><p>Sam gave him a thumbs up, and then rolled the dumpster underneath the fire escape. Walter slowly let himself down, dropping with a thud. Sam pulled him off the dumpster and they hurried to the sidewalk.</p><h2><span id="chapter-19">CHAPTER 19</span><a href="#chapter-19" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Julia and Dean sat in silence on the train. She had grabbed a newspaper that had been left on the seat and behaved as though she was engrossed in its contents. Dean watched her with curiosity out of the corner of his eye. Here was a woman who was just as comfortable holding a gun in people’s faces and just as good at getting information out of them as he was. Dean shuddered a bit—She’s just like me, but hotter.</p><p>Not being someone to let a tender moment go undisturbed, Dean leaned over her shoulder.</p><p>“What you reading?”</p><p>“The Times. Do you mind?” Julia turned the page and tried to ignore him.</p><p>He scooted closer, and she moved away.</p><p>“Aw, come on, don’t be like that,” Dean whispered. “I’m reading too.”</p><p>Julia peeled off a page of the paper and passed it to him.</p><p>“You gave me the comics.”</p><p>Julia’s small heart-shaped face beamed.</p><p>“Kids like the comics.”</p><p>Some twenty minutes later, the conductor announced that they were pulling into Grand Central Terminal.</p><p>Dean and Julia alighted from the train and quickly found Sam and Walter waiting for them underneath the large concourse sign. They all eyed each other suspiciously.</p><p>“So, now what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We know he’s getting on a train,” Dean said, “we just don’t know which one.” Hundreds of people were rushing to make afternoon trains back to the suburbs, clogging the station’s hallways. There were dozens of possible destinations, and none of them seemed more likely than any other.</p><p>“Okay, well let’s just think a moment,” Julia said as she studied the departure board. “James is after the scrolls, right? But why?”</p><p>“Your dad and I were asking ourselves that,” Sam said, and Julia shot a look at her father. “James isn’t possessed by a typical demon,” Sam continued, “but something more like a guard dog.”</p><p>“Okay, but the question is why?” Walter said.</p><p>“Someone put the guard-dog demon in with the scrolls. I saw a symbol on one of the jars, something we see quite often.” Sam meant the Devil’s Trap he had seen on the inside of the lid on one of the jars. “The symbol traps a demon inside it, and we can only assume that James accidentally released the demon and it possessed him. And it seems that it will go to every length to protect the scroll.”</p><p>“Dad, did you know this?” Julia looked at her father with a glint of anger in her eyes. “Did you know they were cursed?”</p><p>“I didn’t know for sure,” Walter admitted.</p><p>Julia turned away from her father, clearly miffed that he hadn’t told her about the hidden danger.</p><p>“Was there anyone at the auction that you recognized, Julia?” Sam asked, trying to anticipate where James could be going.</p><p>“Well, there was one guy, but everything was moving so quickly.”</p><p>“Who?” Walter asked.</p><p>Julia searched in her purse and pulled out a billfold.</p><p>“The guy in the piano bar.”</p><p>Dean stared at her incredulously. “The guy whose wallet you lifted was at the auction? Why didn’t you tell us before now?”</p><p>Julia shrugged. “I lift a lot of wallets.”</p><p>Dean took the wallet. Inside was a California license.</p><p>“Eli Thurman, Berkeley address.”</p><p>“Wait, Eli the red-head?” Sam asked. “He disappeared right after the case fell. Slipped out while the cops were going after you guys.”</p><p>“That’s as good a guess as we can make,” Dean said. “We in agreement?”</p><p>Walter nodded, then, after a pause, Julia agreed.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said. “‘Cause if we weren’t, I was going to ditch your asses. Let’s find that train.”</p><p>The four stepped up to the ticket counter and asked which train was leaving for California. The ticket clerk looked over his schedule.</p><p>“Not to California direct. Goes to Albany, Detroit, then Chicago. Then there is a Chicago-San Fran, the Overland Route.”</p><p>“Good enough. Four tickets, please.” Sam gestured for Julia to pay.</p><p>“I don’t have enough money for that,” Julia whispered.</p><p>“One hundred dollars and two cents,” the ticket guy said as he eyed the strange quartet. “You’ll have to re-ticket in Chicago.”</p><p>Dean drew his face close to Julia’s.</p><p>“Between all of those wallets, you don’t have a hundred bucks?”</p><p>“My father and I live off of these!” Julia hissed. When Dean didn’t relent, she stuffed her hand into her purse. “Fine. Give me a second.”</p><p>Instead of cash, she pulled out a locker key. She walked over to a bank of steel lockers running alongside one of the station walls. Popping open a locker, Julia took out a large leather suitcase. She popped the clasps on the case and took a pair of socks from inside. She then returned to the group carrying the case. She pulled out a wad of cash from the socks and handed it to her father.</p><p>“That’s living in style,” Dean whispered to Sam.</p><p>“Two tickets in a sleeper car,” Walter said to the clerk. He took some of the bills and shoved them over the ticket counter, then looked at Dean and Sam. “You boys find your own way.”</p><p>The brothers were speechless. These dicks don’t understand who they’re dealing with, Dean thought. Walter took the tickets and led Julia away by the arm. Dean and Sam managed to lock step with them.</p><p>“You like jumping on moving trains,” Walter growled. “Here’s another opportunity.”</p><p>On the train platform, Julia pointed out Eli Thurman’s red hair. He was holding a large leather suitcase, which was wide enough to house at least four of the jars. James the security guard wasn’t far behind—he was skulking around a steel pillar, keeping out of sight of Eli.</p><p>He looked as if he’d been dragged through Hell and back. I know how that is, buddy, Dean thought.</p><p>The plan was that Walter and Julia would check into their sleeper car and keep an eye on Eli. Sam and Dean were instructed to jump down to the other side of the tracks and, once the train pulled out, they could run alongside and jump on board, ticket free. The only thing they had to do was keep moving if they saw a ticket guy, because he would ask for their names and car number.</p><p>When the porters weren’t looking, Sam and Dean walked to the end of the train and dropped down from the platform onto the rails. The platform was about chin high, giving them lots of cover to sneak around to the other side of the caboose.</p><p>“Not quite first class accommodations,” Dean said as he moved along the other side of the train, trying to pick a good area where they would have enough time to run and enough train to catch once it started to pull out.</p><p>“What do you think they make of us?” Sam asked as he and Dean walked through the filthy underbelly of the tracks.</p><p>“I don’t know. You’re the one that made friends with Wally the Wonder Professor.”</p><p>“He’s a scholar, Dean. He understands the Bible, he can read Aramaic or whatever those scrolls are written in. Once we get that scroll he’s going to be useful.”</p><p>“Have you thought that these are regular people— well, sort of? They don’t handle the idea of possession, Satan and Armageddon well. You didn’t tell them about Armageddon did you?” Dean turned around, his eyes boring into his brother.</p><p>Sam moved past him, clipping him with the duffle bag.</p><p>“No, I didn’t Dean. Jeez.” Sam kept walking into the tunnel. Dean sighed, and followed him into the darkness.</p><p>Even though Leanne Keeny was almost a full head taller, she still struggled to follow Rose McGraw’s quick step to the penthouse. Rose’s large bottom swung from side to side, a movement that would have made any sailor think of home. Leanne on the other hand was lithe and leggy, a farm girl who had escaped to the big city. Getting a maid position at the Waldorf was a big thing, and her first real job besides castrating horses on her parents’ farm.</p><p>Leanne tried to concentrate as Rose explained that the Waldorf Astoria expects every employee to respect each guest’s privacy. Rose leaned closer, her onion breath making Leanne cringe. Rose said conspiratorially that once Joe DiMaggio was here with another woman, not Marilyn, but Leanne didn’t hear it from her. Rose wiggled her red eyebrows to further emphasize how confidential that information was.</p><p>At the penthouse door, Rose dug into her apron pocket and pulled out the maid’s skeleton key. She knocked, and then slipped the key into the latch.</p><p>The place was a mess, the shootout at the auction the day before had left everything in a shambles. Tufts of fluff dotted all the silk couches, there was blood on the Oriental rug and strange scratches on the floor, furniture was turned over—it was a war zone. Rose clucked her tongue, she needed to go get Maintenance. She told Leanne to get started cleaning up the pieces of glass. She would be back in a couple of minutes.</p><p>Leanne looked around the room. Then she pulled a waste bin from the maid’s cart, and got down on her hands and knees with a dustpan and brush. As she swept up the shards of glass, she noticed they weren’t actually glass but clay. Leanne pushed them into the basket. As she shifted her weight, she noticed in the other room that a jar had rolled underneath the bed, half obscured by the ruffled bedspread.</p><p>Leanne pulled the jar from its hiding place and carried it into the main room. She peaked outside to make sure Rose wasn’t coming down the hallway, then set the jar on the table. It was tall and oblong, and the same dusty color as all the pieces that littered the floor. Leanne thought that surely the owner would be happy that one of the jars wasn’t broken.</p><p>Then curiosity got the better of her. She dug her nails into the seam of the jar. At first, the lid wouldn’t give, it was stuck by some sort of tar-like substance. Finally, it twisted a bit and Leanne managed to separate it from the jar. Beneath it was a horsehair stopper formed with more tar. Leanne looked around for something to pry the stopper off. She spotted a letter opener on the floor and shoved that between the seal and the lip. A whooshing sound escaped from the jar.</p><p>Leanne was knocked to the floor, her legs splayed akimbo, as a dark, thick smoke poured out of the jar, taking shape on the floor. It grew larger and broader, almost to full human size. Leanne tried to pull herself up, but the black smoke enveloped her ankles—it felt like her legs were caught in two tons of wet cement.</p><p>The last thing Leanne remembered was the acrid smoke shooting up into her mouth and forcing itself down her throat.</p><p>Ten minutes later, when Rose returned to the room with Sal the maintenance guy, Leanne was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Children these days. You just can’t trust them. Leaving the job on the first day. My stars,” Rose sighed.</p><p>Sal nodded his head in agreement and they went about their business cleaning up the Presidential Suite.</p><p>At first Anthony didn’t notice the leggy blonde girl as she rushed into the Roman Art wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The museum got hundreds of visitors a day, and he thought she was just in a rush to meet up with the group of elementary school children who were wandering around on a class field trip. It wasn’t until he heard the sound of glass breaking that he decided to step into the hall and take a look around.</p><p>The girl stood in the middle of the hall. At her feet lay the remains of a glass case that housed several Roman jars from about 70 AD, if Anthony recalled correctly. As he watched, she pushed another glass case over and grabbed the pottery jars one by one, smashing them to the ground.</p><p>A column of smoke began to rise from each of the smashed jars. Anthony’s first thought was to find a fire extinguisher, but then the woman moved to another case and did the same thing.</p><p>“Hey lady, you can’t do that!” Anthony labored toward her, reaching for his gun. “Stop it or I’ll shoot.”</p><p>The woman didn’t seem to hear him. She turned on her heel and pulled at a long case displaying a half-dozen small silver boxes. The case toppled and broke. Puffs of smoke rose from the boxes.</p><p>Anthony aimed his pistol at her. “I mean it ma’am. Don’t touch another case!”</p><p>The woman turned toward him. Her eyes were pure black.</p><p>“Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!” Anthony exclaimed fearfully as he instinctively squeezed the trigger. The shot hit her in the shoulder. Children screamed and ran out of the room. But the bullet hole didn’t even slow her down. She pulled over another case, and more smoke filled the air. Columns of greasy vapor drifted down the hall where the cases had been smashed, seeming to rise and move with a will of their own.</p><p>Anthony stepped closer. A pillar of smoke billowed up in front of him. That was the last thing he remembered.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean noticed the train moved faster than he thought it would.</p><p>“Come on, Sam,” Dean shouted as he pulled himself onto one of the ladders that hung from the side of the cars. He held out his hand to his brother. Sam pursed his lips as he huffed alongside the tracks. He took off the duffle bag and threw it at Dean.</p><p>“Come on, tough guy. You’re running like a seventy year old.”</p><p>Sam kicked his ass into high gear and thrust his hand toward Dean. His brother pulled him onto the steel grating between the two cars. Safely on the platform, Sam doubled over, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>“It’s hard to run in these pants,” he gasped.</p><p>“Sure it is Sammy.” Dean brushed the tunnel soot off Sam’s shoulders. “Let’s find Dad and Sis.”</p><p>Mary Anne Struthers couldn’t believe her eyes. She was sitting on her fire escape facing north, with the Hudson River and New Jersey to her right, trying to get cool in the midday heat. That was when she saw a group of people on the overpass of the tunnel above the train tracks. About twenty of them were standing there, some even looked like children. As the 4:40 train left Grand Central Station headed toward Albany, every single one of the people stepped off the bridge and disappeared below. Mary Anne wiped her brow, thinking she must have imagined it or it was some kind of mirage. But as the train pulled further north she saw the same people swarm down its sides and into the caboose. Strange, she thought. Then she shrugged.</p><p>She felt for the bottle of cold beer by her foot and continued to watch the world go by.</p><h2><span id="chapter-20">CHAPTER 20</span><a href="#chapter-20" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean and Sam found Walter and Julia’s car. Julia opened the door, and Dean noticed she must have decided now was a good time to freshen up because she had styled her hair and put on a fresh blouse and skirt. The brothers squeezed into the sleeper cabin. It had two pull-down beds, one on each side of the roughly six foot-square space. Velvet jumper seats ran parallel on either side of the car. Walter was sitting down, studying the book that he and Sam had retrieved from the Bible Society.</p><p>“So what’s next, sports fans?” Dean said. “We just going to sit around here and do our summer reading list? ‘Cause I’m still trying to finish James and the Giant Peach.”</p><p>“Sit down. I’ve found a couple of citations that might relate to what I think is possessing James.” Walter looked at Dean and Sam over a pair of smudged reading glasses. “And yes, in lore they are very often found with Lilith. But not only Lilith, there are other demons which are identified with them as well.”</p><p>“Like who?”</p><p>“Like Satan’s wives, Eisheth and Agrat Bat-mahlat.”</p><p>“Wait, Satan’s wives?” Dean didn’t like the sound of that at all.</p><p>Sam blanched. “So we’re dealing with pre-biblical scrolls, which most likely have pre-biblical demons like Lilith protecting them? That could be a bloodbath.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Julia gripped her hands together.</p><p>“It means that everyone on this train could be in danger,” Sam explained. “It’s impossible to get everyone off. We’re going to have to demon-proof the entire train.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“Okay, well, we can trap them or we can kill them with a knife—that we no longer have.”</p><p>“Can a demon jump from body to body? I don’t want to be possessed by a demon.” Julia’s voice caught in her throat as she continued, “If you guys spend so much time around demons how come you don’t get possessed?”</p><p>In unison, Sam and Dean loosened their ties and pulled at their collars, revealing their protection tattoos. Julia blushed as she looked at Dean’s.</p><p>“Oh. I see. Okay then. So what’s our next step?” she asked.</p><p>The boys formulated the plan. First they would need to get Eli into a safe place. Then they would have to set it up so that as James followed Eli, they could trap him in a Devil’s Trap. The unfortunate thing was James, the real James, was probably toast. The guard dog was having a field day, probably pissing all over everything. There was no way the man’s body was going to come out unscathed, especially after the gunshots and that fall he took. After that they were going to have to relieve Eli of the scrolls. And they had to do that carefully, because no one knew what else was lurking in the jars. Then there was Eli. They didn’t know anything about him. The safest thing now was to just assume he was human, he would bleed like everyone else.</p><p>“So what do we do first?” Julia asked.</p><p>“I think dinner,” Dean said with a smile.</p><p>“Really?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I reckon the dining car is going to be our best bet for the showdown—set up salt and Devil’s Traps. Later tonight, when it’s closed down, we draw Eli in there. James stays out, we rough up Eli, take his milk money and run.”</p><p>“I’ll stay here. There are still a hundred questions I have. I’ll order in.” Walter made himself comfortable.</p><p>“I’ll go.” Sam said.</p><p>“Why don’t you stay here with Walter. Or start marking up the other end of the train, away from us?” Dean motioned with his eyes toward Julia, who was paying no attention to him.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Fine.”</p><p>Dean grinned at Julia. “I guess it’s just you and me.”</p><p>She looked at him. “I think you need to wash your face first.” She motioned toward the small bathroom.</p><p>Dean opened the door and, looking in the mirror, noticed a large smudge of soot on his cheek. He rubbed it off with some spit and his fingers.</p><p>“Good as new. Let’s go sweetheart.” Dean opened up the cabin door. “Food’s on you, money bags.”</p><p>Sam handed Dean a half-dozen red wax pencils out of the duffel bag. “Mark as you go.”</p><p>Posing as a young couple in love, Julia took Dean’s arm as they negotiated the narrow hallways to the dining car. At each door leading to a new car, Julia would keep look out while Dean pulled up the carpet. On the bare floor he drew a Devil’s Trap, and then laid the carpet back over it.</p><p>“What about the windows?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Hopefully we’re only dealing with one. But if there are more demons coming, we’ll have to salt the windows and any other way they could get in.”</p><p>The dining car was functionally opulent, with white linen tablecloths, plush springy red-velvet seats and flowers in crystal bud vases on each table. A maîtred’ led them to a table. Dean pulled out Julia’s chair for her.</p><p>“I didn’t know you could be such a gentleman.”</p><p>“It’s a working dinner, sugar nips, don’t get any ideas.” Dean squinted at her. “Plus, there’s our guy now.”</p><p>Eli Thurman was reading a newspaper while shoveling beef bourguignon into his mouth. The case—presumably containing the scrolls—was placed firmly between his knees. Dean looked around, and noticed that on the other side of the door, at the far end of the car, James was pacing past the window, glancing in frequently to check on Eli.</p><p>“Wow, that guy is hardcore.”</p><p>“Hard what?”</p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p>“So can I ask you a question?” Julia smiled at Dean.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“Who are you guys, really?”</p><p>Dean looked into Julia’s eyes. He instinctively knew better than to trust her. But something pulled at him from inside, he felt some sort of connection to her. He resisted.</p><p>“I’ll lay it out straight. We are exterminators of a sort. And I am in the family business. But what I do and how I do it, it’s best if you don’t know.”</p><p>“But you know about demons, inscriptions within ancient pre-biblical urns. You mentioned a knife that can kill demons. And it’s not the first time you’ve run into whatever almost killed my father,” Julia said carefully. “It seems to me that there is much more to you than meets the eye.”</p><p>“There’s always much more than meets the eye—but we haven’t known each other for that long,” Dean said with a wink.</p><p>“So, my life is in your hands and I’m just going to have to trust you?”</p><p>“Basically.” Dean looked down at the menu. “No burger?”</p><p>“I’m serious. I want to know who you are.”</p><p>Dean closed his menu in a huff.</p><p>“Okay, listen lady, I know you’ve been playing it pretty cool up till now, but I don’t trust you or your dad. I don’t know what your bag is and I don’t want to know. But in my experience a gun-toting pretty face only leads to one thing. Trouble. So I’m steering clear of you. We’re here to get the scroll and get back home. We can pretend this is all for one and one for all musketeers crap, but when the time comes I’m going to do my job, just make sure you do yours.”</p><p>Julia didn’t blink, she didn’t even blush.</p><p>“You think I’m pretty?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-21">CHAPTER 21</span><a href="#chapter-21" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam took a couple of wax pencils and decided to start from the back of the train. As people slept in their seats in the economy cars, Sam quietly moved through, marking all the doors with Devil’s Traps. He had to move quickly, Devil’s Traps took a while to draw and it was a long train.</p><p>Sam finally reached the storage cars, and made his way to the caboose. On the ceiling as well as on the floor, he carefully drew a Devil’s Trap. His back was to the door when a man in a uniform opened it and stepped in.</p><p>“Hey, what are you doing in here?”</p><p>Sam spun around. “Oh sorry, I was trying to find my bag. I forgot to bring my shaving kit to my cabin.”</p><p>“Well, let me help. You take that side, I’ll look on this side,” the guy said as he waddled toward Sam. “What’s the name on the suitcase?”</p><p>“Ahh, George. George Michael.”</p><p>“What do you do George?”</p><p>Sam tried to seem anxious about finding his suitcase.</p><p>“Oh, you know.” Sam was drawing a blank. “I’m a song and dance man.”</p><p>“Really? Because I would have said you were a liar!”</p><p>The uniformed man dived at Sam just as he ducked and rolled out of his way, knocking a pile of steamer trunks over. The man’s eyes flashed black as he flung himself over the trunks. Sam didn’t have a weapon—he had stupidly left the salt-packed shotguns in Walter and Julia’s cabin—and he doubted that there was any salt hanging around the storage car. Sam kicked the demon in the face, then swung at him with a heavy-handled suitcase. The large man fell face first, giving Sam an opportunity to move toward the door, past the Devil’s Traps.</p><p>The guy leapt to his feet with surprising grace, and threw himself at Sam, landing rather nicely in the middle of the hastily drawn symbol on the floor.</p><p>“Get me out of here,” he growled.</p><p>“Sorry, guy. You need to answer some questions first.”</p><p>“Go to Hell.”</p><p>“Really, that’s all you got? How many more of you are there?”</p><p>“You’ll never possess the scroll. It doesn’t belong to you.”</p><p>“What do you know about it?”</p><p>With that the demon took out a pistol.</p><p>“Don’t!”</p><p>Sam lunged at him, but the demon put the barrel to his head and pulled the trigger. Sam lay on top of the brain and blood spattered corpse. Black smoke screamed out of his mouth, and gathered as a dark cloud on the ceiling. With a whoosh it flew out an air vent.</p><p>Crushed and frustrated, Sam pulled himself up and retreated back to the cabin.</p><p>Walter was finishing a ham sandwich.</p><p>“Good lord, what happened to you?”</p><p>“Guy, or demon rather, just blew a man’s brains out. Where’s Dean and Julia?”</p><p>“Still eating.”</p><p>“We have to tell them. Let’s go. Grab your books too.”</p><p>Walter hurriedly picked up his jacket. Sam grabbed his duffle bag and handed Walter a shotgun.</p><p>“Do you know how to use one of these things?”</p><p>“Of course. I fought in both wars.”</p><p>Sam had forgotten that this was an era where generations of people had lived through two world wars. It seemed strange to think that the third war would be Armageddon itself.</p><p>Sam and Walter made their way to the dining car.</p><p>Eli dabbed at the corners of his mouth and set the napkin onto his plate. He then grabbed for the case that housed the scrolls.</p><p>Dean looked at Julia. “You’re on.”</p><p>Julia glanced at Eli, and drained her martini glass. She approached Eli’s table.</p><p>“May I join you?”</p><p>Eli didn’t look up as he pushed out his chair. “I’m sorry, I’m leav—“ His eyes met Julia’s large baby blues.</p><p>“Oh please, do have one drink with me. It’s so dull traveling alone. Don’t you think?”</p><p>“I thought you were with that fellow over there?” Eli looked up, but Dean was nowhere to be found.</p><p>“Oh that plebian, not at all. He invited himself to sit with me. All the while, I was hoping to join you for dinner.”</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>It was clear that Eli did not remember Julia. The refined woman wearing a blouse and a nice-fitting red suit looked quite different from the gun-toting, jeans-wearing, 1950s Lara Croft who had stormed the Waldorf’s Presidential Suite.</p><p>As Julia continued to chat up Eli, Dean met Sam and Walter in the hallway in the next car.</p><p>“Another demon,” Sam reported.</p><p>“Damnit. From where?”</p><p>“I don’t know. The one in the caboose was a security guard. Strange thing was his uniform said he was from the Metropolitan Museum of Art.”</p><p>“Let’s get everyone out of the dining car and get this freaking scroll from Howdy Doody. ‘Cause I want to get back home,” Dean said.</p><p>Julia was still talking to Eli when the boys and Walter walked into the dining car. Even though Eli was only giving one-word answers to Julia’s questions, he was clearly enthralled. Walter sat at the table right behind Eli.</p><p>Sam quietly ushered the other diners out of the car. After flashing a police badge, he said he was train security and there had been a series of thefts. Everyone was asked to go back to their cabins and seats and check all their belongings.</p><p>Dean asked all the waiters, most of whom were African-American, to go back to the kitchen car. This was official train business, he explained, and they needed to use the dining car.</p><p>None of them moved. “What kind of official train business? We weren’t told of anything,” a lithe black guy said to Dean, “and they always tell us if it has to do with service.”</p><p>Dean noticed that James had disappeared from the doorway. That’s not good, he thought. He turned to the waiter.</p><p>“Can you get me all the salt you have in the kitchen?”</p><p>“Salt? Sir, I’m truly sorry, but I can’t—“</p><p>“Listen, dude, I get it, you’re just trying to keep your job. But right now there is a distinct possibility that a whole host of very ancient and pissed off demons are on this train. And I need that salt.”</p><p>“Demons? Why didn’t you say?” The guy pulled a small green cloth bag out from the collar of his shirt. “Chicken bones, feather, little dust. Demons don’t scare me none.”</p><p>“Hoodoo?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Born and raised and taught by my momma.”</p><p>“Great. Then please get me all the salt you have, and start making lines at the doors and windows.”</p><p>“You got it. Name’s Ray.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you. Dean.” Dean shook Ray’s outstretched hand. A couple of other guys followed Ray out of the dining car to the kitchen.</p><p>Julia looked down at her watch. “Well, look at the time. We really do need to retire. We reach Chicago quite early tomorrow, don’t we?”</p><p>Eli noticed the car was now empty of diners, save for two big guys and the old man seated behind him. Finally, he took a good look at Sam. Recognition dawned on his face. Eli got up and moved to pick up his case.</p><p>“I’ll take that,” Walter said, pulling the case from underneath Eli’s chair.</p><p>“That’s mine. You can’t have it. I remember you—you were at the auction too.” Eli looked around the room. “You all were.”</p><p>Dean trained a shotgun on Eli.</p><p>“Yes, and you took something that we need.”</p><p>Walter backed up behind Sam and Dean as Julia stepped away. Eli visibly started to panic.</p><p>“You don’t understand—I need those.”</p><p>“Yeah, buddy, so do we. Sort of like the entire planet hangs in the balance.”</p><p>An enormous crash echoed from the dining car ceiling.</p><p>“What was that?” Eli shrieked. Small flakes of paint floated down from the gilded ceiling.</p><p>“They’re on the roof,” Sam cried. “Walter, Julia, make these signs everywhere!” Sam threw them wax pencils.</p><p>“You,” Dean indicated Eli. “Stay where you are.”</p><p>Eli shuddered as he watched Walter attempt to open the locked case. A series of bumps and thumps emanated from above.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Eli demanded, sounding scared.</p><p>“I’ll tell you what’s going on,” Dean snapped. “The contents of your little suitcase there comes with a whole mess of angry demons that are bound to protect it. During your Thomas Crown moment they were released, and now they’re after whomever has the scrolls. So bite it, buddy. Right now we’re saving your sorry ass.”</p><p>Dean hastily drew a Devil’s Trap on the ceiling, then another right next to it.</p><p>Ray and the other waiters returned from the kitchen car.</p><p>“Hey man,” Ray said warily, “I don’t want to be the bearer of bad news, but it’s looking bad out there. Like a damn demon hoe-down.”</p><p>“Just my type of gig.” Dean handed Ray a wax pencil. “Don’t need to be da Vinci.”</p><p>The banging sound from above stopped.</p><p>“Where’d they go?” Julia asked, peeking out of the window.</p><p>“They’re trying to find another way in,” Dean said.</p><p>“Will they?” she asked.</p><p>“Hopefully not, but if you see one, use this.” Dean handed her a shotgun filled with salt shells. “I have a feeling you can handle it.”</p><p>Dean then grabbed his brother and they moved to a corner to confer.</p><p>“So what’s the plan?” Sam asked.</p><p>“They’re here for the scrolls right? But we don’t know which one—are they protecting all of them, or only one?”</p><p>“I would guess that if Lilith has anything to do with the demon possessing James, then it has to be our scroll. The War Scroll. If you were Lucifer, wouldn’t you want to protect the battle plan to defeat you?”</p><p>“Right, but... musty old ancient bitch demon, how does she know what we give her?”</p><p>Sam and Dean set about tearing up linen tablecloths.</p><p>“Hey Ray, are there any canisters in the kitchen, like for flour or something?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Absolutely. But I don’t think I want to go out there.” Ray motioned toward the door scrawled with the Devil’s Trap. “They sound like some bad-ass demons.”</p><p>“I’ll go with you.”</p><p>Dean grabbed the shotgun back from Julia.</p><p>“You know, you could have brought along your own firearm, if you’re so women’s lib.”</p><p>“What?” Julia asked, puzzled by the modern reference.</p><p>Dean aimed the shotgun at the sky as Ray opened the door and they crossed the rattling platform to the kitchen car.</p><p>Dean kicked open the door, the stainless steel glinted from the fluorescent lights. He stepped in further.</p><p>Ray gasped. The chef, a pudgy man with floppy ears, was splayed out on the floor, his heart split in two by a meat cleaver. The sous-chef had fallen at his side, with a soup ladle impaled through his eye.</p><p>“Bernie and Ralph didn’t deserve that,” Ray muttered.</p><p>“Let’s get that flour.” Dean stepped over the bodies to the baking area. He grabbed four steel flour canisters and handed them to Ray.</p><p>“Well, well,” a voice said. “I was hoping to meet the son of the mother slain, the vessel of goodness and light.”</p><p>Dean spun around to face a young girl in a Waldorf Astoria maid’s uniform. With her blouse half-unbuttoned, her skirt cinched up, and her lips blood-red, she was clearly a full-on, fully sexed-up demoness.</p><p>“Who the hell are you?” Dean’s shotgun was aimed right at her heart.</p><p>“Exactly. I do love scholars. I’m Eisheth, sister to Lilith.”</p><p>“Lilith has family?”</p><p>“Sister by marriage. I’m one of Lucifer’s wives and so is she.”</p><p>“So you’re like Mormon demons? Kinky.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes flashed red.</p><p>“I wouldn’t make it mad,” Ray whispered.</p><p>Dean moved toward Eisheth. “Well, listen, this was really fun and all, but we better be getting back.” He trained the gun on the demoness and stepped toward her, Ray close behind him. “Just a little warning, the salt in here is going to burn a lot, like a bad herpes outbreak. They have that back where you’re from?”</p><p>“You remind me of the town leper,” Eisheth growled.</p><p>“Yeah, I get that a lot.”</p><p>They circled one another until Dean and Ray could back-peddle out of the kitchen toward the dining car.</p><p>Ray opened the door and backed out first.</p><p>There was a low growl. Dean turned his head to see James perched above them on the scaffolding between the train cars. Before Dean could get off a shot, James jumped at Ray.</p><p>Ray hit the deck of the car and almost rolled off. Dean shot James in the shoulder, making the animal even madder. He turned and lunged at Dean.</p><p>From inside the dining car Sam had his shotgun trained on the back of James’s head. Dean gave a nod and ducked as Sam took the shot. The window shattered.</p><p>James’s body fell forward, lifeless. The demon inside shot up into the air and out of sight.</p><p>Dean spun around just in time to catch Eisheth dragging Ray back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Leave him alone, he didn’t do anything. We’re the ones with the scrolls.”</p><p>“I’ve always liked a proper sacrifice,” Eisheth hissed. She produced a long blade, picked Ray up by the neck and in one swift movement sliced him from groin to throat.</p><p>“No!” Dean got off another shot as Eisheth flung Ray aside and raced toward him.</p><p>Dean dived back into the dining car. Two of the waiters pushed a wooden table up against the door’s broken window. Eisheth pounded on the other side of the barrier.</p><p>Dean pushed his back against the wall—that wasn’t a fair way for Ray to go.</p><p>“I found out who we’re dealing with,” he said.</p><p>“Who?” Julia came forward.</p><p>Eli sat quivering in a corner.</p><p>“Bitch named Eisheth. Know anything about her, doc?” Dean looked at Walter.</p><p>“Yes, she’s one of Satan’s wives. She doesn’t come up very much.”</p><p>“Yeah, because she’s playing second fiddle to Lilith.”</p><p>Sam looked to see if Eli had any inkling as to what they were talking about. From the look on his face, it seemed like he did.</p><p>Sam leaned over Eli. “What do you know about the scrolls?” he shouted into the little guy’s face. “You’re not telling us something. Why did you want them so badly?”</p><p>Eli scrambled to the other side of a table.</p><p>“They’re precious. You wouldn’t understand. The scrolls were written by the Essenes, devout followers of Judaism. They are pre-biblical.”</p><p>“Tell us something we don’t know.”</p><p>Just then, the train lurched. Everyone fell forward.</p><p>“What is that bitch doing now?” Dean got up and pushed his head out of the window. Eisheth was underneath the train. Sparks flew as a piece of the undercarriage rolled down the incline of the train tracks.</p><p>“Hope we didn’t need that.” Dean trained his shotgun at Eisheth. The shots went wide.</p><p>“So now what do we do?” Walter had spread the War Scroll over a couple of tables.</p><p>“You put that in here.” Dean threw him the metal container.</p><p>“But this isn’t sterile. This is centuries-old parchment, it can’t be exposed to foreign substances.”</p><p>“Well it’s a foreign scroll in a foreign land. Put it in there.”</p><p>Walter gently wrapped the scroll in a tablecloth and put it in the canister.</p><p>“Now give it to Sam.”</p><p>“You don’t understand—“ Walter faltered.</p><p>“Old man, do you want to get out of here alive or not? Give it to Sam!”</p><p>Sam took the canister and placed it in the duffle bag that hung from his shoulder.</p><p>“Julia, take the scroll jar and stuff it with strips of tablecloth. We’re going to make a little ancient trade. Who wants to play bargain with a demoness?”</p><p>No one raised their hands.</p><p>“Okay then, guess I have to have a little tête-à-tête with this bitch myself. Sam?” Dean beckoned to his brother.</p><p>They huddled together. It was a bad situation and the fact that they were on a moving train just added to their problems.</p><p>“This is what I figure,” Dean said. “We need to get the passengers away from her. And we need to get away from her. I say we play a little Great Train Robbery and detach the cars.”</p><p>“What about Eli?”</p><p>“We have the scroll, right? Just let him go.”</p><p>Five minutes later, Sam had scaled the train through the back door of the dining car. The roof of the car was rain slicked, and a wind blew off the Great Lakes on his left. He made his way over the top of the dining car toward the bar. Sam had to move quickly in order to get over to the passenger car and detach it from the train.</p><h2><span id="chapter-22">CHAPTER 22</span><a href="#chapter-22" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean cocked his shotgun as he stepped out of the dining car. Julia followed him holding the jar containing the pieces of tablecloth. She salted the door behind her and went after Dean.</p><p>“Hey second string!” Dean called into the night air. He and Julia stepped into the next car. A long wooden bar extended down one side.</p><p>“Wow, swanky. Hey Lilith’s handmaid, where you at?”</p><p>Eisheth appeared between them and the dining car. Great. Now Dean was going to have to make a deal with Eisheth and get around her before Sam detached the car from the train.</p><p>Two more demons popped up from behind the bar.</p><p>“Drink?” Dean asked as he moved toward them.</p><p>“Who is she?” Eisheth pointed at Julia.</p><p>“My little sister. She comes with me everywhere. Always tagging along. Sort of like you and Lilith.”</p><p>“That whore? I was shut away for thousands of years while she got to play out in the world.”</p><p>“Oh come on, she’s family, you gotta love your sister. Well, maybe not. I mean she did get to shack up with Lucifer way more often than you did. Do you think they have a china pattern?”</p><p>“Retribution comes to those who wait.”</p><p>“I think it’s ‘good things,’ but whatever. So Eisheth, how about we make a deal? I give you the scroll, and you go on your merry way. And while you’re at it, you can let these poor people who your friends are knocking around in go. They can just jump out of them and leave them in peace.”</p><p>“War doesn’t leave anyone unscathed.”</p><p>“Semantics, Eisheth. About the scroll.”</p><p>“Is that it?”</p><p>Julia placed the ancient jar on the bar.</p><p>A possessed bartender reached for it, black eyes flashing.</p><p>“Leave it!” Eisheth eyed the guy. “It’s not yours to defile. It’s my responsibility.”</p><p>“So this is all about responsibility? Fantastic. I admire that in a demon. You take your job seriously. I get it. Now we’re just going to scoot on out of here.”</p><p>“Wait! I want to see it,” Eisheth hissed.</p><p>Dean hoped that Sam was just about done playing model train because things were getting bad down here.</p><p>Sam was in fact hanging onto the side of the train, in between the bar car and the passenger car. He was struggling with the hitching mechanism when he realized the steel levers that hooked the train cars together required a key. He scaled the ladder once again.</p><p>Sam sprinted across the tops of the cars. He looked into the distance. It was dark, no lights—he couldn’t see anything speeding toward him as he ran. One tree branch or tunnel would do him in. Could he die in the past? He was pretty sure he could.</p><p>Sam jumped down to the platform of the engine. He tried the door, but the lever wouldn’t budge. Sam banged on the door until the engineer emerged out of the darkness. He was a tall guy in striped overalls. Just like you would expect. Sam motioned for him to let him in.</p><p>“Who are you?” the engineer asked as he pushed open the door a crack.</p><p>Sam played dumb. “I seem to have lost my way.”</p><p>In a flash, he shoved himself through the opening and gave the engineer a smack to the nose with his elbow. The man fell to the ground.</p><p>“Where’s your hitching key?” Sam demanded.</p><p>The prone engineer pointed to a long steel rod hanging on the wall.</p><p>“When you feel the train get lighter you push this thing full throttle, okay?” The man nodded.</p><p>Sam leapt out of the car and scaled the ladder once again.</p><p>Dean heard Sam run across the roof for the second time in five minutes. He must be close.</p><p>“Why do you want to see it?” Dean challenged. “What’s on it that’s so important.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes flashed red again.</p><p>“You know what I think?” Dean continued. “I think you’re torn, because you promised your husband that you would protect this thing for him. But at the same time you know what it says. It’s how to kill him, isn’t it?”</p><p>Dean saw Julia glance at him out of the corner of his eye. Her look said, Surely this isn’t the best way to negotiate with a demon?</p><p>Ignoring her, Dean carried on goading Eisheth.</p><p>“You know what else I think? I think that you’re pissed Lucifer gave you the babysitting job, and now you just might want to read that little battle plan for yourself. You know, take your husband’s job, sort of like a senate seat.”</p><p>Eisheth lunged at Dean. He knocked her back with the butt of his shotgun.</p><p>“No touching.”</p><p>Eisheth lunged at him again, just as the train sped up dramatically. Through the window he could see the passenger part of the train start to pull away. The split-second distraction enabled Dean to push Julia toward the dining car.</p><p>Eisheth spun around and attacked Dean. He fell to the ground, face first. The shotgun skittered away from his reach.</p><p>Julia darted forward and picked it up, blasting Eisheth in the shoulder and knocking her off Dean. The two bartenders came after Julia, but in a surprising move she coupled a round-house kick with a flash of a blade.</p><p>The gashes to the demons’ bodies flared orange and they dropped to the ground. Ruby’s knife!</p><p>“What the —! Julia run!” Dean screamed as he rolled over and kicked Eisheth in the chest, sending her flying across the bar.</p><p>Dean turned toward the door. Sam was waving urgently. He was now in the process of unhitching the bar car.</p><p>Dean leapt to his feet and got halfway out onto the platform, but Eisheth was close behind. She grabbed him and pulled him to the ground in the doorway. Below him, Dean could see the levers clicking as the car struggled to detach. Sam was pushing heavily on the lever.</p><p>“Time to go, Dean.”</p><p>Eisheth got her hands around Dean’s throat. He struggled to breathe.</p><p>“Wow, 3,000 years in a jar hasn’t done anything for your dental hygiene,” he croaked.</p><p>Dean managed to get his knees up and reverse donkey-kick Eisheth back into the bar car.</p><p>“Now!” Sam screamed.</p><p>Julia opened fire on Eisheth. The salt bullets penetrated her body, each shot pushing her further back into the bar car.</p><p>Dean rolled backward into the dining car just as the bar car split off. The rest of the train hurtled down the tracks.</p><p>Eisheth was left standing in the bar car, cursing.</p><h2><span id="chapter-23">CHAPTER 23</span><a href="#chapter-23" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The bar car plummeted into the darkness of the night. Sam and Dean shut the door behind them. They had gotten rid of Eisheth for now, but she would be after them as soon as she realized that the scroll had been switched.</p><p>Inside the dining car, Julia tried to avoid Dean’s gaze. He walked up to her and roughly grabbed her arm.</p><p>“What the hell was that?” he demanded.</p><p>“Get your hands off her!” Walter protested.</p><p>“Wait your turn, old man, you’re in on this too. You have our knife! Do you know how useful that could have been the last couple of days? We’re fighting demons, and it’s the only thing that kills them. Hello, fighting demons.” Dean motioned to the carnage around him. “Not to mention the fact that you did steal it from us. Do you have anything to say for yourself?”</p><p>Julia looked up at Dean. “I’m sorry. We needed to find out who you were. And I took it. I didn’t know what it was for, until today.”</p><p>“Which begs the question: Who are you?” Dean stood beside Sam glaring at Walter and Julia.</p><p>Walter stepped forward. “We’re hunters. Just like you.”</p><p>“And you were going to tell us this when?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Doesn’t anyone care that there were demons on this train!” Eli wailed in panic from his corner.</p><p>Dean, Sam, Julia, and Walter turned toward him in unison and shouted, “SHUT UP!”</p><p>Julia tried to speak soothingly to Dean. “I know you feel betrayed, but we were trying to protect ourselves just as much as you were. I didn’t steal it in order to put you at a disadvantage.”</p><p>“You sure about that?” Dean spat.</p><p>“Here.” Julia held out the knife. “I know I can’t make up for it.” She pulled out Sam’s BlackBerry and held it gingerly. “I took this as well, but I don’t know what it’s for.”</p><p>Sam grabbed it from her, and concealed it inside his jacket.</p><p>“You have a lot of explaining to do, young lady,” Dean said.</p><p>“Right, well, maybe,” Walter conceded reluctantly, “but right now we need to get as much track in between us and that demon as possible.”</p><p>Dean scowled at Julia. Besides his hunter instincts, which told him never to trust her again, Dean felt a knot of discomfort in his stomach. His feelings were hurt.</p><p>Dean sublimated his anger and hurt while they looked at the rail line map of the Water Level Route. It ran from New York City to Albany along the Great Lakes to Chicago. They were just about at Albany.</p><p>“We need to get a move on,” Dean said as he grabbed a shotgun and headed for the engine car.</p><p>Sam and Dean made their way over the platform between the cars.</p><p>“Go easy on the guy, I already clocked him once,” Sam said as he knocked on the car’s door. No answer. Dean took the butt of the shotgun and slammed it against the wood.</p><p>The engineer immediately opened the door.</p><p>“Okay, okay.” He backed up from the doorway with his hands up. “I haven’t done nothin’. I’m driving her as fast as I can.”</p><p>“And you’re going to keep driving it all the way through Albany. Don’t stop until we’re outside of Chicago. You got that?”</p><p>“I’ll have to call ahead and get them to change the tracks. What do I tell them?” the engineer stuttered.</p><p>“Tell them Eisenhower is on board. Top secret mission and there’s no stopping,” Dean said.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>“Wow, okay. Yes sir. Right outside Chicago it is.”</p><p>Dean nodded and they headed back to the dining car.</p><p>“Do you have the feeling that people really are more innocent in the fifties?” Dean asked.</p><p>Everyone in the dining car looked a little the worse for wear. Julia sat with her legs up on a chair. Dean immediately noticed their slender shape, and the way her ankles tapered down to her feet. Walter mumbled to himself while sat at a table. Eli was a mess. But the waiters seemed to have taken everything, even the gruesome death of one of their own, in their stride.</p><p>“Everyone get some rest. We’re skipping Albany and going straight for Chicago. Good burger town,” Dean announced.</p><p>Everyone grabbed extra tablecloths and lay down on the floor or on tables pushed together. They had over 500 miles to sleep through.</p><p>Dean and Sam sat in the corner holding shotguns while everyone else slept.</p><p>“I don’t trust them,” Dean said quietly. “Even if they are hunters. Where do they get off stealing things like that?”</p><p>Sam shot Dean a look. Was he whining?</p><p>“We always steal things.”</p><p>“I know, but we need them. And, like, I would never steal from another hunter.”</p><p>“Yeah, but it’s not like we know hundreds of other hunters, either.”</p><p>“Whose side are you on?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“I’m on your side, Dean. Why are you PMSing?”</p><p>“I’m not PMSing. You are.”</p><p>Sam thought it best to change the subject. “So what do you want to do?”</p><p>Dean peered at Walter and Julia’s sleeping figures in the darkness.</p><p>“We have the scroll. First light we get the hell out of here.”</p><p>Sam shrugged. They would find a way to translate the last pages of the scroll somehow. If not, they could always have Abbandon do it for them. He was the one that had told them all about the scroll in the first place, so surely he could read it.</p><p>Sam watched as lights from tiny towns flickered across the dining car’s blood-red rug. For a moment, in all this craziness, he missed Ruby. It was an awful thing to feel, since she had betrayed Sam into thinking she was on their side. She had fed him her own blood, which made Sam incomprehensibly more powerful than he ever thought was possible for a human being. But, then again, he wasn’t really a human being in some senses. Would a human being drink demon blood? Sam doubted it.</p><p>“What do you think is on the scroll?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. Hopefully a step-by-step recipe, like a brownie mix. Something that tells us what Lucifer’s weaknesses are. There has to be another way.”</p><p>Sam hoped that was true.</p><p>At first light the train was on the edges of Gary, Indiana. The morning was grey, low clouds hung over the lake, threatening summer thunderstorms. Dean woke up first, nudged Sam, and they got to their feet quietly. In the half-light Dean could see Julia and Walter covered with tablecloths, still sleeping.</p><p>Dean and Sam crept out of the dining car. Sam had the scroll secure in the duffle bag hung over his shoulder. Up ahead, the train tracks took a lazy swing to the left—the train would slow enough for the brothers to leap off. They climbed down the ladder on the side of the kitchen car and waited as the train slowed. Sam took the first jump. He rolled down a six-foot incline into a soft green field. Dean then jumped after him. He hit the incline at the wrong angle and tumbled ass over elbows to the bottom.</p><p>“I miss my Impala,” he said, dusting his suit off.</p><p>The train disappeared into the distance. Julia, Walter, and Eli would all find their way. The most important thing was they had the scroll. Now all they had to do was find a way home—back to 2010.</p><p>The boys walked alongside the train tracks. In front of them the town of Gary was beginning to come to life. Small trails of smoke rose from the stacks looming above the steel mills.</p><p>“You know who grew up in Gary?” Dean said.</p><p>“Who?” Sam asked, looking at his brother—he had a feeling this was going to be bad.</p><p>It was. Dean did his best moonwalk, crotch pull and fake head dip.</p><p>“Michael Jackson.”</p><p>“Highly disturbing, Dean.” Sam increased his pace.</p><p>They reached a dirt road that headed west.</p><p>“You’re no fun,” Dean said. “Let’s get to town, get a car and figure out where the hell we’re going.”</p><p>They climbed up a small incline to the road.</p><p>“Nice morning,” a voice called breezily.</p><p>Both brothers swung around. Standing on the other side of the road were Walter and Julia. Julia walked with a sexy swagger toward Dean.</p><p>“Shame on you for not waking us first. We wouldn’t want you to leave without saying goodbye.” She gave him a push and her tone switched from playful to angry. “Who the hell do you think you are?”</p><p>Dean and Sam exchanged looks. Loaded question.</p><p>“That scroll is just as much ours as it is yours. You’re not taking it from us.”</p><p>“Listen lady,” Dean said, “I get it, you’re tough. But we’ve come a long way for this scroll. A lot further than you have. So you and Daddy Warbucks just go on back to New York. We have stuff to do.”</p><p>Sam and Dean continued to walk toward town. Julia raced to keep up with them, while Walter struggled with his bad leg.</p><p>“I didn’t risk my behind so you could take it from us,” Julia cried.</p><p>“Your behind?” Dean smirked. “That’s exhibit A that you’re over your head.”</p><p>He and Sam continued walking.</p><p>“Take one more step and I blow your balls off.”</p><p>They paused, and turned around slowly. Julia was aiming a pistol at them.</p><p>“This isn’t full of rock salt either.”</p><p>“Aww, man,” Dean whined, “are you really going to do this? Where’d you get that?”</p><p>“It’s the engineer’s. Now let’s all get to town and have a nice long talk, shall we?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-24">CHAPTER 24</span><a href="#chapter-24" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The ragtag group walked in silence. Dean was clearly pissed. Sam was trying to figure out if there was any other way to get Walter to translate the last pages of the scroll.</p><p>Julia glared at the nape of Dean’s neck.</p><p>He turned around.</p><p>“You’re burning a hole in my head, sweet-stuff. Look somewhere else.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a look of distaste.</p><p>On the outskirts of Gary they spotted a lone diner on a corner. It was oblong, all glass windows and steel. The rest of the area was basically empty gravel lots.</p><p>They headed for the diner. Inside, a Formica countertop ran the length of the narrow restaurant. Each table had an individual jukebox and a window view. Sam could see two waitresses, both of whom wore yellow dresses with frilly white aprons.</p><p>Three steel workers made a rowdy group, cracking jokes at a corner table. Clearly they had just come off the night shift at one of the mills.</p><p>Walter and Julia slid onto the benches at one of the tables, while Sam and Dean headed for the men’s room.</p><p>“I’ve had enough of the goon suits. Now that we’re back in the real America, I’m putting my jeans on,” Dean said as he unbuttoned.</p><p>“Good thinkin’ Palin,” Sam said as he too began to undress.</p><p>Walter and Julia were speaking in hushed tones when Dean and Sam reappeared. They broke off as the brothers approached. Four cups of coffee steamed in front of them. Dean sat down next to Julia and leaned across her, essentially putting his armpit in her face.</p><p>“Excuse me, got to get the sugar.” Dean grabbed at the sugar shaker. Julia bristled.</p><p>“Okay. First things first,” Walter said, “you don’t leave without us. We all worked to get the scroll. None of us can lay claim over the others.”</p><p>Dean huffed. “Walter, we came a long way for this—“</p><p>“So did we,” Julia insisted.</p><p>Just then a heavy-set woman with a large beehive hairdo sashayed up. She slid menus onto the table.</p><p>“Hi there. I’m Marge. I own this place. Let me know if you need anyth—“</p><p>She trailed off as her eye lit on something outside the diner. Dean followed her gaze out of the window and clocked the deserted lot across the street. Picking their way over the gravel were Eisheth and her cronies, among them several people in Metropolitan Museum of Art uniforms.</p><p>“Incoming,” Dean said quietly. He got up and pulled a shotgun from Sam’s duffel bag.</p><p>“Young man, shotguns are not allowed in my restaurant,” Marge chided.</p><p>“Listen Marge,” Dean said firmly, “out there is a group of very dangerous people. So I apologize if your place gets a little messy.”</p><p>The steel workers in the corner got up to leave.</p><p>“I wouldn’t go out there if I were you,” Dean warned them, glancing over his shoulder. He had the shotgun trained on Eisheth.</p><p>“Buddy, what the hell you doing with that rifle?” one of the steel workers demanded.</p><p>“Believe me, it’s safer in here,” Dean said.</p><p>Julia pushed Walter toward the kitchen. “Dad, get the salt.”</p><p>A waitress walked out with a couple of plates of eggs. Catching sight of the shotgun, she promptly spun on her heel and headed back into the kitchen.</p><p>“Barricade any doors in the back too,” Dean called after Walter.</p><p>Ignoring Dean’s warning, the steel workers walked out of the door onto the sidewalk. Not two seconds later they were attacked by Eisheth’s group.</p><p>A little girl in a Catholic school uniform approached the first steel worker. She kneed him in the groin. When he stumbled and fell to the ground, she smiled sweetly, then slit his throat with a jagged rock.</p><p>The other two men tried to run. A uniformed Met worker shot out his hand and grabbed one of them by the throat. The demon’s strength meant the guy was choked to death in seconds. The third man managed to escape.</p><p>Eisheth stood on the sidewalk, looking up at Sam and Dean. The thin strip of macadam that served as the parking lot was the only thing that separated them from her. That and the salt that Walter and Julia were spreading on the window sills.</p><p>“Game plan?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean stared out at the waiting group of demons.</p><p>“We can stand and fight or make a run for it. Either option is probably a death wish. Though not for you — they’ll keep you alive.”</p><p>Sam looked solemn. He knew it was true. The demons wouldn’t hurt a hair on his head. For the rest of them, however, it was a different story.</p><p>Eisheth made the first move, but was thwarted by the Devil’s Trap Julia had hastily drawn in front of the glass doors.</p><p>“Aww, why don’t you come out and play Sammy?” she called plaintively. “I mean, we’re practically family. I never thought I would get to meet you—my husband’s favorite vessel.”</p><p>Julia looked at Sam with suspicion. “What does she mean by that?”</p><p>“Why, you don’t know? Sammy here has been chosen—“</p><p>Dean blasted Eisheth with a salt shotgun, sending her sailing through the air. She landed on her back, but it didn’t seem to faze her one bit.</p><p>“You can’t stay in there forever,” she said levelly.</p><p>She gave a signal and the demons attacked. The first wave came from a handful of demons crawling up onto the roof.</p><p>“Can they get through that?” Walter asked.</p><p>The creaking sound of ripping metal from above signified that indeed the demons could.</p><p>“What the hell is going on—they better not be taking off my roof!” Marge went behind the counter and pulled out her own shotgun. She let a couple of rounds loose at the ceiling, right below where the demons were trying to break in. “Damn, I just put a hole in my own roof.”</p><p>The first demon that dropped down into the diner was a woman of about Julia’s age. Her eyes flashed black as she sped toward Walter. Julia drop-kicked her, then tried to shoot her with her pistol. But the demon was too fast. She knocked Julia’s pistol away, and pounced on her. Julia twisted, grabbed the demon’s neck, and with a mighty kick threw her over her head.</p><p>The demon landed flat on her back. Julia crawled over to her pistol just as the demon attacked again. Julia turned and shot the woman. Black smoke poured out of her mouth and her body crumpled to the ground.</p><p>“Watch out!” Dean called to her. He spun and started unloading more rock salt bullets at the ceiling as another two demons dropped down onto the counter top. One kicked over the metal cake stand that displayed a cherry pie.</p><p>“Hey man, show some respect to the pies,” Dean shouted.</p><p>He shot the guy in the shoulder. Black smoke shot up and out of his mouth, disappearing into an air vent.</p><p>Outside, the rest of the demons looked like they were itching to join the fight.</p><p>Julia spun and drop-kicked another demon.</p><p>“How are we going to get out of here?” she cried.</p><p>They all heard the rumble at the same time. The cab of a large diesel eighteen-wheeler was barreling over the gravel lot toward the diner. Five demons were dispatched as the grill of the truck ran them over.</p><p>“Get out of the way!” Dean yelled.</p><p>The truck cab hit the front part of the diner. It tore open like tin foil. Inside the cab was the third steel worker.</p><p>“I know trouble when I see it. Get in!” he called.</p><p>Sam continued to shoot at Eisheth.</p><p>“Not the last you’ve seen of me, baby doll,” Eisheth purred.</p><p>Walter, Julia, Sam, and Dean scrambled onto the front of the cab.</p><p>“Not so fast.” Marge shot out her hand and grabbed Walter’s foot. Her eyes flashed black. “Someone needs to stay here and help me clean up this mess.”</p><p>Walter struggled to hold on to the truck’s hood.</p><p>The steel worker looked at his side mirror.</p><p>“We gotta roll. More are comin’ our way.”</p><p>Marge slashed and pulled on Walter’s ankle as Julia tugged at her father’s wrists. Meanwhile, Sam and Dean kept Eisheth and the others at bay.</p><p>“Dean, help!” Julia cried.</p><p>Dean twisted and shot Marge between the eyes. She rolled off the front of the cab and dropped to the ground. Black smoke poured out of her mouth.</p><p>“Go, go, go!” Sam shouted.</p><p>The driver punched the cab into reverse and swung wide, running over a couple more demons. As they perched on each side of the cab, Sam and Dean shot at the demons. The truck barreled off. Julia pulled her father into the cab.</p><p>“Thank you so much!” Julia exclaimed, wiping the sweat from her brow.</p><p>“My pleasure.” The steel worked introduced himself. “Name’s Mike. It looked like you needed some help. Once I saw what those things did to Benny and Jim, I knew I had to do something. I just gotta return this cab to the mill by nighttime.”</p><p>“No problem. Can you take us past Chicago?” Dean called.</p><p>The truck sped down the streets of Gary and then swung onto a two lane interstate highway.</p><p>With the horizon clear of demons, Sam and Dean ducked inside the cab.</p><p>“How do you think she found us?” Julia asked. “Wasn’t James supposed to be her bloodhound?”</p><p>“Dumb luck,” Dean said. “We should have headed the other way. She won’t find us again. We’re going to be long gone.” He was sure of it.</p><p>Mike let them off 200 miles west of Chicago, just before Davenport. Walter, Julia, Sam, and Dean got off at an unmarked exit ramp. They thanked Mike for saving their lives.</p><p>“So now what?” Julia asked.</p><p>Dean noticed that Julia had ripped her skirt and her blouse had lost buttons.</p><p>“You need to get yourself some demon-fighting clothes,” he commented. “Those things aren’t going to cut it anymore.”</p><p>The four of them walked up the road in the twilight. Soon they came upon a friendly looking motel where each room was an individual little house. A small café was attached to the office.</p><p>“I think I’m going to check in, then go to bed,” Walter said wearily.</p><p>“Me too,” Sam said. “Dean?”</p><p>“Going to stay up for a bit. Sort of jacked up.”</p><p>Dean headed toward the café.</p><p>“I’ll join you,” Julia said.</p><p>“Why don’t you freshen up first, sweetheart.” Dean suggested with a hint of spite.</p><p>Julia nodded and headed toward the motel office.</p><p>Dean and Sam stood in the gravel parking lot watching Walter and Julia.</p><p>“Ditching them went well.” Dean looked at his brother. “Now what?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “Let’s sleep on it. Next thing we need to do is get the hell back home.”</p><p>“Any suggestions? Because I’m getting sort of tired of Pleasantville.”</p><p>“Let’s go back to Waubay, South Dakota, and hope Don has enough wherewithal to pick us up from there. I’ll go check us in.”</p><p>Dean noticed Julia standing in the doorway of her cottage. Moments later, Sam reappeared with two keys and threw one to Dean. He ducked inside his cabin.</p><p>Half an hour later, Dean lay on his bed. Sam had decided to grab some food after all. Dean was bored. There wasn’t a TV in the room, the only entertainment offered was a selection of black and white pamphlets explaining the local tourist attractions.</p><p>“Oh good, a milking museum,” Dean said to himself.</p><p>There was a soft knock on the door.</p><p>“It’s open, Sam.”</p><p>Julia appeared in the doorway. She had changed into a sweater and jeans and a pair of hiking boots. Dean wondered where she’d managed to find clean clothes.</p><p>“May I come in?”</p><p>Dean sat up. “Sure, yeah.”</p><p>Julia shut the door, and leaned against it.</p><p>“Need some company?” She smiled.</p><p>“Not usually.”</p><p>“That was some fight back there,” she said, and sat down beside him on the bed.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “I have a feeling you’ve seen it all before. So tell me, what do you and your father really specialize in? It has to be something scholarly. I know—lying and stealing, maybe even some money laundering thrown in for good measure. Anything to survive—right?”</p><p>“I have a feeling you and your brother do the same.”</p><p>“Maybe, but you’re as fake as silicone, baby. And I hate silicone. Ruins the moment, you know.”</p><p>Julia let out a small laugh.</p><p>“Sometimes I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>She crept her hand closer to his. Dean looked down.</p><p>“Sweetheart, I’m tired. Anyway we can put this off until... say never?” Dean looked her in the eyes.</p><p>Julia didn’t seem to be putting on a front now. It had been a long time since Dean had spent this much time with a woman. The Apocalypse, Sam, Lucifer, it had all worn him down. He was on autopilot. Dean wondered whether he would wake up some day and his entire life would have been one bad dream.</p><p>“Maybe you like me so much because you know we are both always pretending to be someone else. I see myself in you.” Julia breathed shallowly. “Maybe you see yourself in me.”</p><p>“Wow, there are so many different ways I could take that.” Dean smiled. “But sorry, I don’t get close to people. Not in my line of work.”</p><p>“Me neither.”</p><p>“I doubt that very much.”</p><p>“Why can’t you be nice to me?”</p><p>“Not my nature. I’m a hunter, I don’t get close. It becomes your weakness. It’s bad enough to hunt with family.”</p><p>Julia nodded. “I know how you feel. My mother died at the hands of something evil. My father swore to avenge her death. And he did. He was born into this life. He never knew anything different. My mother, however, she didn’t pick this. She had no idea. I was only a baby when she died. So my father took me with him. I studied with him. I grew up knowing about demons, monsters—“</p><p>“Everything that goes bump in the night.”</p><p>“Yeah. I guess. There are a lot of people like us. A whole group of people we work with. We meet up every month and pool our resources. You would be amazed what you can get done in groups. Demons sure, but vampires, easy to wipe out with a group of a hundred hunters.”</p><p>“Wait a minute, you know a hundred hunters?” Dean stopped caressing her thigh for a moment.</p><p>“Yup. So if you’re hunters and we’re hunters, why haven’t we heard of you?” Julia asked.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “My father taught us to be on our own. He always said other hunters are fine for some jobs. But in order to keep moving, best to be by yourselves.”</p><p>“I guess so. Still strange though. We have an entire network of people and you’ve never come up.” Julia cocked her head to the side, looking at Dean.</p><p>“Like I said, best to be on your own.”</p><p>Dean’s cheeks flushed. He grabbed Julia by the wrist and pulled her on top of him. He held her head in his hands. She stared into his eyes.</p><p>“Why do you need the scrolls?”</p><p>“I can’t tell you that.”</p><p>“My father knew that he was destined to do something good for people. Then, when they started finding the Dead Sea Scrolls, he knew that he had to find the one scroll his mother always told him about. The ultimate battle plan for the war between good and evil. Hundreds of people have been waiting thousands of years for that scroll to appear. And your brother has it in his bag in a flour can.”</p><p>“Could be worse, I guess.” Dean shrugged.</p><p>“You really piss me off, you know that?”</p><p>“Yup.”</p><p>Dean gave her a long kiss. Her lithe body relaxed on top of his. He pulled her sweater up over her head, and ran his hands over her sinewy back. She quickly undid his belt buckle with one hand. Dean raised an eyebrow, impressed. He kissed her again.</p><h2><span id="chapter-25">CHAPTER 25</span><a href="#chapter-25" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>When Dean woke the next day, Sam was standing in the doorway. Silent. He made a face. Dean shrugged. Sam soundlessly closed the door behind him.</p><p>Dean looked at Julia still asleep beside him, then levered himself carefully out of bed. He grabbed his jeans and leather jacket, then struggled to get his boots on. He left the room and walked across the gravel parking lot. Sam was nowhere to be seen. Dean muttered curses under his breath. He needed coffee and Sam had wandered off like a kid at Disneyland.</p><p>Then Sam swung into the parking lot. Dean gulped as he saw his brother was driving a brand-new green-and-white 1953 Oldsmobile Fiesta. It had a large chrome grill like a duck bill on the front, white wall tires, 170 horsepower and two-tone seats. Only four were made in 1953.</p><p>“Do you know how much one of these is worth?” Dean said excitedly.</p><p>“Keep your voice down. The sticker price is $5,700. I found it in the glove compartment.”</p><p>“One of these sold at auction for 150 K, just last year. Well, you know, in fifty-five years. Man, I wish I could bring this back with me!”</p><p>“Speaking of which. Let’s get on the road. I have an idea that Don will know to look for us in Waubay.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>Dean got into the passenger seat.</p><p>“You don’t want to drive?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Didn’t get much sleep.” Dean smirked. “By the way, they have a network of like a hundred hunters.”</p><p>Sam looked at his brother in surprise.</p><p>“You’re kidding me. We’ve never come across that big an organised group before. What do you think happened to them?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “And supposedly, they all know about the scroll. Specifically the War Scroll.”</p><p>Sam looked stunned. He pulled the car out onto the two-lane highway and headed north.</p><p>“How do they know about it?”</p><p>“I don’t know. A whole group of hunters all believing the scroll has a meaning. Sounds sort of like a cult. But they know about it, that’s for sure.”</p><p>“Do you think Julia and Walter told them?”</p><p>Dean looked out of the window. “Whether they did or not, we’ll be long gone into the future by the time they find out.”</p><p>For the first time since they were flung back to 1954, Dean felt a squeeze of regret. Sure he had spent loads of time with plenty of women. But it was true that very few of them meant anything to him. Somehow Julia seemed different. Not only did she know the life that Dean had grown up in, but she was similar to him. Dean never had trouble being himself around people—that insecurity type thing wasn’t his bag, there were too many other more important things to deal with—but Julia made Dean want to be better. Just being around her made him want to not be such a jerk. He’d been fighting it since they met. But somehow Julia had an affect on Dean. Oh my god, am I turning into Jack Nicholson in that Helen Hunt movie?</p><p>Dean swallowed and noticed there was a lump in his throat. He looked down at his sweaty hands leaving imprints on his jeans.</p><p>Sam glanced over at his brother.</p><p>“What’s your problem?” Sam raised a curious eyebrow.</p><p>“Nothing. Shut up.”</p><p>For about a hundred miles Dean stared out of the window. He kept going over and over in his mind the first time they had met. He didn’t feel guilty about leaving her. He had a job to do. He’d left plenty of women while they were sleeping.</p><p>So why was he feeling guilty now?</p><p>Seven hours later they pulled into Waubay. The town didn’t look much different in the 1950s, everything just looked fresher, the paint wasn’t peeling and the roads were newly paved. The bar where they would meet Don was basically the same, except the building didn’t have as many cracks in it.</p><p>They took a booth in the back and ordered two beers.</p><p>Sam brought out the flour can with the scroll stuffed inside.</p><p>“Put that away,” Dean hissed, scowling. “If Don zaps us back to 2010, we don’t want to accidentally leave the scroll behind.”</p><p>“So, I have a thought. If in the future only the last pages of the scroll are missing, what do you think happens to the rest of it? We know it eventually ends up back in Israel. How do you think it gets there?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Maybe Eli the garden gnome shows up again and takes it there. Who knows? I don’t care. We have the scroll, we’ve got what we came for.”</p><p>The Winchester brothers finished three more beers apiece. Still no Don. Dean was getting agitated. Local patrons had come and gone. The bartender had already given them complimentary fish sticks. But still Don was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“You think we should use the sigil?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No, that will invite every angel that’s on Earth right now. We’ve flown under the radar up until now, let’s not draw attention to ourselves.”</p><p>“Good point.”</p><p>The bar closed at twelve. The brothers thanked the bartender, a large gruff guy in a plaid shirt, and told him that if anyone showed up looking for them, they’d be at the motel down the road. The bartender nodded.</p><p>The next day, the boys resumed their vigil in the bar, still waiting for Don to zap them back to 2010.</p><p>“What the hell is taking him so long?” Dean growled.</p><p>“I don’t know. There really isn’t anything else to do but wait.”</p><p>“Great. Waiting around for another angel, exactly what I wanted to spend my life doing. At this rate we’ll be seventy by the time he shows up.” A cloud passed over Dean’s face. “You don’t think he’ll leave us here that long, do you?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But think about it this way—you could spend the rest of your life with Julia. Happily ever after.”</p><p>Dean knuckle punched Sam’s arm. “Shut up.”</p><p>He tried to change the subject. “Why don’t you just study up and translate the scroll? Maybe we can get out of here that way.”</p><p>“I’ve been trying. It’s beyond what I can translate, Dean. It’s ancient Aramaic, written in Aramaic script. It’s half language, half symbols. I have no idea what it says. Without Don we have no chance of finding out the final battle plan for Lucifer.”</p><p>“Well, can’t you learn?”</p><p>“I could, but we would need to go to a large university, like Chicago or Berkeley. The texts that would teach me ancient Aramaic aren’t just lying around the Waubay Library. And then I would need to study for months to be able to understand even the most elementary of symbols. I mean, look at it.”</p><p>Sam made sure no one in the bar was taking notice. Then carefully pulled out the scroll and smoothed it onto the table top.</p><p>“Look at how complicated this is. It’s not like learning an alphabet. There is a symbol for every word. And a sound that goes with every symbol.”</p><p>That was the end of the discussion.</p><p>On their third day of waiting around in Waubay, Dean got out of bed and looked out of the window at the foggy summer morning. They had to do something. This was ridiculous.</p><p>“Sam.”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>“Sam, wake up.”</p><p>Sam rubbed the sleep from his eyes. “I’m up. What?”</p><p>“We’ve got to call Julia and Walter. We need Walter to translate the scroll. It doesn’t matter anymore if he knows what the scroll says. Someone else will have to know what the last pages say besides us, right? We have to call them.”</p><p>“Dean, we have no way of getting in touch with them. They don’t have cell phones. I can try Walter’s office back at the Biblical Society in New York, but I doubt they went back there. What do you suggest? Besides, are you sure this isn’t because you just want to see Julia?”</p><p>“No, Sam, it’s not. We have nowhere else to turn. If you have a better idea, I’m all ears.”</p><p>Dean did in fact want to see Julia. Every fiber of his body wanted to, but his mind kept telling him, “No.”</p><p>In truth though, Julia and Walter were the only people they knew in 1954 that could help them. If they translated the page, they would have an idea how to defeat Lucifer. At least with that information they could call the angels to help them.</p><p>Sam and Dean had—very reluctantly on Dean’s part— ditched the Oldsmobile Fiesta and hotwired an old Chevy instead. It didn’t go very fast, but they didn’t want to draw attention to themselves anyway.</p><p>They rolled into a local electronics store. It was filled with black-and-white TVs. In the center of the store, on a raised platform covered in a green shag rug, was a color television. Mesmerized kids sat in a cluster in front of it. Even the adults couldn’t look away.</p><p>A guy in a brown suit approached Sam and Dean.</p><p>“Looking to buy a new television set, gentlemen? Look at this beauty, a hundred dollars, top of the line. Technicolor they call it. Look at that picture. It’s like you’re really there.”</p><p>“Thanks Crazy Eddie. Do you have CB radios?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Of course, all brand new. Biggest craze yet, huh? Right over here.”</p><p>Crazy Eddie led them to the back of the shop, where a series of CBs and ham radios were set up. None of them were plugged in.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. Sam looked at Dean. Eddie went back to the customers crowded around the color TV. Sam and Dean grabbed some equipment and hid it in their leather jackets.</p><p>As they walked out, Dean patted Crazy Eddie on the back.</p><p>“Thanks, think we’ll pass.”</p><p>“Anytime,” the man said genially.</p><p>Back at the motel, Sam and Dean set up the ham radio and CB.</p><p>“How do you know they’ll even be on a CB or ham radio?” Sam said as he plugged one of the units into the wall socket.</p><p>“Guess we’ll just have to chance it. How else is this group of hunters communicating?”</p><p>Sam and Dean spent the next couple of hours putting out feelers on the radio units.</p><p>“Breaker, breaker. Looking for Papa Bear and Baby Bear. Ten, thirty-five. We’re up in the land of the Walleye. Anyone read?”</p><p>Sam and Dean had no idea what Julia and Walter’s handle would be. But they had an idea that they would be monitoring the airwaves.</p><p>About six hours later, Julia’s voice crackled over the CB radio.</p><p>“This is Baby Bear.” Dean could tell from Julia’s tone that she wasn’t happy with his moniker for her.</p><p>“Is this Dopey? Come in Dopey?”</p><p>“Yeah Baby Bear, this is Dopey. You and Papa Bear want to meet up?”</p><p>There was silence on the other end of the radio.</p><p>Eventually, “What’s your twenty?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Two Pines Motel,” Dean said.</p><p>“Be there in twelve hours,” Julia responded. “Over and out.”</p><p>The radio was taken over by static. Dean looked at Sam.</p><p>“Aren’t you the least bit pissed that we didn’t know they were hunters?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What else can we do? Besides, does it matter? Let’s just get out of here as soon as we can.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-26">CHAPTER 26</span><a href="#chapter-26" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Exactly twelve hours later, there was a knock on the motel room door. Julia and Walter stood in the doorway, wearing what looked like fishing gear.</p><p>“Were you fishing?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Trying not to draw attention to ourselves,” Julia said tersely as she pulled a large shotgun out of one leg of the rubber waders she had on. “Plus, it’s a good way to carry around firepower.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>Walter walked into the room and sat on the bed.</p><p>“So, you ditch us and now you need our help?” He stared pointedly at Dean.</p><p>Dean gulped. Had Julia told her father they slept together? Dean met Julia’s eyes. She looked away. That was an affirmative. Crap.</p><p>“So you can’t translate the scroll on your own. Just like you couldn’t have gotten it on your own. And now you need our assistance. Again,” Walter said.</p><p>“Yes,” Sam said. “It would take months. Can you help?”</p><p>“You’ve ditched us twice now. There is a hoard of demons looking for us because of you. I’m not quite sure what’s in it for Julia and me.”</p><p>“I don’t think that’s because of us—“ Dean interrupted.</p><p>Walter held out his hand to stop him.</p><p>“Regardless, now you come begging for our help.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t exactly say begging,” Dean said.</p><p>“Boy, let me finish.”</p><p>Dean was about to tell Walter he reminded him a lot of their friend Bobby, but he decided to keep his mouth shut.</p><p>“Let’s get started,” Walter said.</p><p>Walter laid a large suitcase out on the bed. It was filled with loads of dusty texts—most looked even older than the ones he’d had in his office in New York.</p><p>“From my own private collection,” he said.</p><p>“Where did you get all of these?” Sam asked. He was amazed at the array of books. There were sixteenth-century Bibles, dozens of books in ancient Greek, even some old parchment scrolls.</p><p>“I’ve collected them since I was a boy, in anticipation of this very moment. We have a safe house south of here, and I locked them up in a bomb shelter there. I always knew they would be important.” Walter grew somber. “I’ve known about the existence of the scroll since I could talk. I knew I would one day hold it in my hands. It was my destiny. I’m part of the link in the chain to ultimately defeat evil. And that destiny is coming true.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a look but said nothing.</p><p>Walter pulled out the bedside table in between the twin beds, so it stood halfway down the beds. He then took the round side table and put that next to the bed on one side, and took a chair and put that on the other side of the other bed.</p><p>“Can I have the scroll?”</p><p>Sam reached into his bag and pulled out the steel flour can. Walter reached for it gingerly. He took out the scroll and gently laid it on the round side table. He spread the scroll out, end to end. The last couple of pages came to a rest on the chair.</p><p>“Walter, can we start from here?” Sam indicated. He knew exactly where the translation of the scroll in modern times had left off.</p><p>“Why? It’s a twelve-foot scroll.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. This time, a whole unspoken discussion passed between them. They couldn’t explain that they already knew what the first ten feet of the scroll said. Sam looked back at Walter.</p><p>“Legend has it that it’s a battle plan, right? So let’s start from the end. Eisheth is already on our tail. Let’s just cut to the chase. We can always go back.”</p><p>“You have a point. Okay. Let’s get started.”</p><p>Walter opened up each and every one of the books that he had brought. Leaning over the parchment, he traced a symbol with his finger then started paging through a book looking for its match.</p><p>“Grab one, this is how it’s done.”</p><p>Sam sat down on the floor, grabbed a book and started thumbing through it.</p><p>“I’m going to go get some air,” Dean said.</p><p>“Me too,” Julia agreed. “Dad, you okay?”</p><p>Walter waved her away.</p><p>Dean and Julia stepped outside. There was an awkward silence.</p><p>Julia broke first. “I bet you don’t call a lot of women after you spend the night with them.”</p><p>“Not usually. No.”</p><p>“So this is good, you can use my father just like you used me.”</p><p>Dean looked her in the eyes. “I didn’t use you. And as far as your father is concerned, he’s a grown man. He knows the deal. You’re hunters, right? Sometimes you use people for information—just like you used Sam and me back in New York.”</p><p>“That was different, I needed to find out who you were.”</p><p>“Well, now you know.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that I like you, now that I know the real you.”</p><p>Dean walked away from Julia across the parking lot.</p><p>“I wasn’t untruthful.” Julia followed him.</p><p>“You weren’t exactly forthcoming either.” He spun around. “All that bullshit about your father being a scholar, and then you show up here with an arsenal taped to your back. What else are you hiding? I mean, I like a girl with a hint of danger, but you’re far and away the most dangerous piece of ass I’ve ever had.”</p><p>Julia slapped him hard across the face.</p><p>“My father was a scholar. He is a scholar. But we have another life.”</p><p>Julia looked up at Dean with tears in her eyes.</p><p>“I have no choice. Don’t you understand that? Look at every other girl my age. They’re married, have a house, a husband. Kids. Do you know that by the age of nine, I knew I would never have that? Ever. That is not a normal existence. So excuse me if you didn’t get all the information. I had other things to do.”</p><p>“Like saving the world?”</p><p>“We don’t know what’s on the scroll. Maybe there is a part for me to play. I hope so. I don’t know. But I don’t have a choice. Do I?”</p><p>“No, you don’t. Nobody does. I’m finding that out.”</p><p>Standing next to Julia, watching the grass swaying in the warm evening breeze, Dean felt a brief moment of happiness. Strange as that is, he thought.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to slap you.”</p><p>Dean lifted her chin gently in his hands. He gave her a slow, deep kiss.</p><p>“You’re forgiven,” Dean said.</p><p>“That wasn’t an apology,” Julia huffed.</p><p>“It’ll do. Let’s get some coffee.”</p><p>Sam and Walter worked diligently into the evening translating the text. Walter knew a lot of symbols that weren’t in the books. It would have taken Sam a lot longer if he had done it on his own. But still, the process was laborious.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean and Julia sat in the café across the street from the motel.</p><p>“So, no picket fence for you?” Dean said, stirring his coffee.</p><p>“Don’t think so,” Julia absent-mindedly scribbled on a napkin. “So what about Eisheth, what can we do about her?”</p><p>“I don’t know. She’s supposed to guard the scroll that essentially tells the secret of how to destroy her husband. She’s going to go after it with everything she’s got. That’s why it’s so important that we find out what it says. If she shows up again, I have a feeling that she’s going to have made a lot more friends.”</p><p>A few hours later Dean and Julia headed back to the motel room.</p><p>Sam and Walter were wide awake and still working hard, though Sam’s hair was wet, so he must have just taken a shower. Walter peered at his daughter and Dean as they stood in the doorway.</p><p>“Shut the door. The scroll shouldn’t be exposed to the elements,” he said.</p><p>Dean sat down.</p><p>“Have you found anything?” Julia asked.</p><p>“Yes, and no,” Walter replied as he peered through a magnifying glass at the scroll.</p><p>“What does that mean?” Dean said with a hint of sarcasm.</p><p>“Well, the text on top says that the battle lines are drawn with people’s faith. The believers versus the non-believers. In order to defeat Lucifer it says this, ‘The Adversary’s undoing lies in a trail of blood across the ages. All that become hosts must become ash.’”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. They knew what hosts becoming ash meant.</p><p>Oblivious, Walter carried on. “But often the writers of ancient scrolls tried to hide something beneath the actual text. They would create a chemical reaction which would reveal the true text. Sam and I finished and the text seemed pretty cut and dry. But then, Sam took a shower.”</p><p>“He always makes a mess, doesn’t he?” Dean said.</p><p>“Yes, he does. But the steam coupled with the water droplets coming off his body as he reached for another towel... Well, it produced this.”</p><p>Walter gently held up the last pages of the scroll. Though Aramaic script could be seen plainly on the page, another page seemed to be underneath it.</p><p>“It looks like a list,” Julia said.</p><p>“Yeah, it does.” Dean looked closer at the parchment.</p><p>“Can you tell what it says?” Julia asked.</p><p>“They’re names,” Walter said.</p><p>“Names?” Dean said, alarmed—your name on a scroll that Satan was trying to protect. Well, it couldn’t be good.</p><p>“But that’s not the most peculiar thing,” Walter said. “Some of the names belong to angels.”</p><p>“That’s weird.” Dean looked at his brother. Was there something more? Sam was eyeing Dean. Dean knew that look. It was the We gotta talk look.</p><p>“I think I have something in the car that can help,” Sam said. “Give me a sec.”</p><p>Sam and Dean walked outside to the parking lot.</p><p>“So, what did you really find?” Dean asked as soon as they were out of earshot.</p><p>“Walter’s right, they’re names—paired up with the names of angels.”</p><p>“So what, that’s what Don wanted us to find? A list of angel names.”</p><p>“Don’t you see, Dean, if the angels don’t have vessels, there’s no war. Yes, our names are on the scroll. But there’s more. It’s basically a roster of all the soldiers in a battle. But we’re here for a different reason.”</p><p>“That was his plan? No vessels, no fight?” Dean punched a car hood. “That’s ridiculous. I’m going to kill him when I see him.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “The demons aren’t going to kill these people... Abaddon sent us to do it...”</p><h2><span id="chapter-27">CHAPTER 27</span><a href="#chapter-27" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The four of them sat in the motel room largely in silence as Walter transcribed the names, slowly but surely teasing out the angels’ most monumental secret.</p><p>The scroll associated each angel with the bloodline of his or her potential vessels. Sometimes only one host was listed, sometimes many. When Walter got to the line that read, “‘Castiel—borne by the progeny of Ishmael: Gregory Novak, who begat James Novak, who begat Claire Novak,’” Dean’s jaw clicked shut. Sam looked over at his brother. They had met Castiel’s vessel, Jimmy Novak, and his daughter Claire, while Cass was being interrogated in Heaven.</p><p>The process dragged on, as each name required Walter’s deliberation. Meanwhile, Sam had surreptitiously started translating from the bottom of the page, where the very last name seemed to read: “Michael—borne by the Sons of Light, John Winchester, who begat Dean Winchester.” It would take Walter another hour to get there. And then, Sam thought, they’ll know everything.</p><p>“Stop,” Dean blurted out suddenly.</p><p>All eyes turned to him.</p><p>“Stop writing.”</p><p>Walter let slip an exasperated breath, but continued to scan his magnifying glass over the tiny sigils.</p><p>“Every minute the scroll spends exposed to moisture degrades the pigment,” he muttered impatiently.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said, “‘cause we’re not doing this.” Grabbing the battered and fragile parchment away from Walter, Dean made for the door.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Julia asked, hurt in her voice. “We finally get a chance to read the thing, and you want to walk away?”</p><p>“Are you not paying attention? Damn thing wants us to butcher a thousand innocent people.”</p><p>“More,” Walter corrected simply. “At least 2,000.”</p><p>Dean held the parchment up to the light. “We’re in this to save lives, not end them. This list—these people haven’t done anything wrong.”</p><p>Walter never took his eyes from the scroll, as if breaking his gaze would cause it to crumble.</p><p>“They’re angelic vessels,” he said calmly. “Both sides in the final battle are angels... and with no hosts, they can’t fight. No Apocalypse. One of the people on this list will be Lucifer’s host on Earth, and we have the chance to kill him.”</p><p>Dean looked to Sam to back him up, but his younger brother was looking away, lost in his own thoughts.</p><p>“Dean, remember why we did this. All of us.” Julia stepped closer to him, her hand beginning to reach out for the scroll. “We want the same thing, and this is how we get it.”</p><p>Dean’s mind was racing. After all, their points were entirely valid. One way or another, the angels were ultimately responsible for the Apocalypse, and killing their vessels would rob them of their foothold on Earth.</p><p>It would also rob the entire Winchester family of their lives.</p><p>“The price is too high,” Dean said softly, despite his thoughts to the contrary. If only dying was enough.</p><p>“What happens to mankind when Lucifer rises?” Walter demanded. “‘And they came forth, winging from Heaven and Hell to the place between. The fates of men hung on their swords, in a place called Armageddon.’”</p><p>Dean recognized the curious quote from one of the more gruesome editions of The Book of Revelation that John Winchester had carried.</p><p>“Billions dead,” Walter said.</p><p>Lost in his thoughts, without acknowledging the others, Sam pulled himself out of his chair and left the room. Dean stared after him, imagining how he must be feeling. A 2,000-year-old scroll just told him his family has to die so that he can’t destroy the world. Probably not feeling great.</p><p>“I know the figures,” Dean said to Walter. “Planetary enema, half the world on fire, all of it. That doesn’t change what’s right and wrong.”</p><p>“None of it is right. But there are two options, and one of them is a lot less wrong.” Walter’s lower lip trembled with emotion. “Three billion strangers versus 2,000 strangers.”</p><p>“The difference is who kills them,” Dean shot back.</p><p>“I don’t want to kill anyone,” Walter said. “But I can’t live out the rest of my life knowing the end is coming, and... and not do anything.”</p><p>“What if it’s wrong?” Julia said hesitantly.</p><p>Walter stared at her for a moment, not understanding.</p><p>“What if the list is wrong, and none of these people are vessels?” she persisted.</p><p>Walter huffed at her, incredulous. “This document was written millennia ago, and it lists a ‘Craig Masterson’ and a ‘Danny Fuller’. Do those names sound ancient to you?”</p><p>“So they were clued in to the future,” Dean said. “The future can change.”</p><p>“No, it can’t,” Walter replied. “Destiny does not change.”</p><p>“My life hasn’t been decided, buddy,” Dean blurted.</p><p>Walter paled, his frown deepening.</p><p>“There will be another way to stop Lucifer,” Dean insisted. “There has to be.”</p><p>With a nod, Walter sat back down. “When I was eight years old, my father bought an automobile. The first in our town. Every boy in my class wished their father could do the same, but... for most of them, it would be years before they could afford it. Two weeks later, my father was the first person in town to crash a Model T. First person to die in an automobile accident.”</p><p>Dean didn’t know where the old man was going with the story, but decided he was better off listening than interrupting. He knew from experience that “dead dad” tales were a sensitive subject.</p><p>Walter continued. “My mother told me, ‘This is what God wanted for him.’ That there was a plan. But deep down, I knew there wasn’t. It was senseless and stupid and unfair. For years, I hated her for saying that. And then, after I’d grown up a bit, I learned the truth. It hadn’t been an accident. My father had been killed by a demon. Protecting me while I slept.” Walter paused for a moment, observing Dean’s muted reaction. “There was a purpose to it. A plan. He gave his life for mine, so that I could be here for this.”</p><p>It was all Dean could do not to roll his eyes.</p><p>“This moment, this choice, it’s what my mother warned me about. It’s fate—“</p><p>“It’s bull,” Dean snarled. “That’s a swell sob story, but I’ve got one just like it. Only my dad didn’t give his life so I could go on to murder innocent people, he gave his life so... so I could get a fair shake. That’s it.” Thinking about John Winchester was always difficult for Dean, especially when he was forced to marginalize his sacrifice. “If he could have kept me from this life, he would have. Same with my mom. I’m sorry to say it, but just about everyone in this line of work loses someone to it eventually.”</p><p>Julia shot Dean a cold look, but he soldiered on.</p><p>“It doesn’t give you a special destiny. It gives you attachment issues and a manageable drinking problem.”</p><p>Frustrated, Walter tried another tack. “This is bigger than all of us. We have to at least let the others weigh in.”</p><p>“Others?”</p><p>“The rest of the hunters, at our headquarters.”</p><p>Dean’s confused look drew suspicion from Walter.</p><p>“You weren’t kidding about doing things your own way. Never heard of a hunter that didn’t report in at least once in a great while.”</p><p>“We’ve never been to... ‘headquarters.’ And we don’t plan on going now.”</p><p>“I can’t let you walk off with the scroll, Dean.”</p><p>“And I can’t let you kill those people!”</p><p>Walter looked Dean in the eye and said with calm authority, “Hand back the scroll, or things are going to get ugly.”</p><p>From beneath the table, Dean heard the unmistakable click of a revolver’s hammer pulling back.</p><p>He had no choice but to comply.</p><p>Sam kicked at the dirt of the parking lot, watching the dust fly up into gloomy clouds that reflected his mood perfectly. He could hear Dean inside, talking to Walter and Julia, but didn’t want to be anywhere near that conversation. The idea that Sam’s death could halt the Apocalypse in its tracks wasn’t a new one—in fact, he himself had thought of it almost immediately after learning that he was Lucifer’s chosen vessel. To have it be Abaddon’s promised solution, however, was devastating. Sam had long ago given up on any hope of a normal life, but giving up on life entirely, along with all of those unknowing souls? He remembered what he had read about Abaddon back in New York. I should have known this would turn out badly, I should have warned Dean. He had wanted to find another way so badly that he had allowed them to walk into this trap.</p><p>When Dean exited the motel room and ambled toward him, Sam made a concerted effort to reign in his emotions.</p><p>“Sammy...”</p><p>“You don’t have to say it. You’re going to figure something out, we’ll stop them from committing mass murder, I know.”</p><p>“No, just... I’m sorry. I know how much was riding on that being the thing to get us out of this mess. And now, it just gets messier.”</p><p>Sam nodded toward the motel. “Where’d you leave things?”</p><p>“At gunpoint. Walter’s convinced this is his destiny, like he’s the Luke Skywalker of the Apocalypse, and that list is going to bring down the Emperor.”</p><p>“Well, it would,” Sam offered. “I mean, the plan would work, right? Cut off the angels from their vessels, they can’t fight the final battle—even using backups.”</p><p>“You’re not actually thinking about this, are you?” Dean asked, his brow furrowing.</p><p>“I’m... I don’t know. What I do know is that if it came down to it, we’d both...”</p><p>“We’d do what we had to do,” Dean said. “Hell, we’ve both died before. But we’re not there yet. And this isn’t just our lives we’re talking about, it’s 2,000 people, probably mostly children. People that have no part in this besides drawing the short straw, genetically speaking.”</p><p>Sam nodded his agreement, but his heart wasn’t in it. Part of him had always wished for an easy way out, and sudden lack-of-existence would certainly do the trick. He tried to change the subject.</p><p>“What are they going to think when they get to the end of the list, and there we are?”</p><p>“Let’s not even go there,” Dean replied. “What I don’t get is why Abaddon would send us here in the first place. Says he wants to defeat the Devil and go on sipping pina coladas for the rest of eternity on Earth. But think about it, if we destroy all the vessels, that means his, too.”</p><p>“So he’d be stuck in Hell.”</p><p>“And he said that he wanted Lucifer to be destroyed entirely, but this would just keep him locked up,” Dean added.</p><p>“With Abaddon stuck guarding him,” Sam continued.</p><p>Both of them paused to reflect on the pretzel that was temporal mechanics. Then Sam chimed back in. “He must not have known exactly what was on the scroll...”</p><p>“Or he’s just another angel douche, playing us for fools,” Dean said bitterly.</p><p>“Where does that leave us?”</p><p>“Screwed, as usual,” Dean said.</p><p>“What if... what if we’re the ones who destroy it?” Sam ventured.</p><p>“Back up.”</p><p>“In 2010, history records that the last page is missing or destroyed. What if we’re the ones who destroy it? To stop Walter from fulfilling his... destiny, or whatever.”</p><p>“Then we’re going to have to fight our way past Walter to get it,” Dean answered. “He’s not going to let that thing out of his sight again, not after we got the slip on him the last time.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean seriously. “Could you do it?”</p><p>“Kill Walter?” The words rolled a little too effortlessly off Dean’s tongue.</p><p>Outwardly, it seemed as though the notion didn’t faze Dean, but Sam knew it did. Dean would never admit to having a soft spot, but right now, it was the exact size and shape of Julia. In fact, it was a novelty for Sam to be on the other side of their usual dynamic—instead of being the lovestruck kid brother falling for the wrong woman, he was the protective one waiting for the right time to intervene. After what had happened with Ruby, Sam doubted if he’d ever again be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman. Not that it matters, since I’ll probably be dead soon. God, that wasn’t morbid at all.</p><p>Dean stared back at the motel room.</p><p>“No. Probably couldn’t,” he conceded.</p><p>“Guess we need another plan,” Sam said, relieved by his brother’s candid response.</p><p>“Yeah.” Dean kicked at the dirt, billowing it into a gloomy cloud, matching the one Sam had made earlier. “I think I’ve got one.”</p><p>Later that evening, Dean went looking for Julia. He found her scrubbing the bands of her car’s CB radio, listening for any hint of voices in the static. Before alerting her to his presence, he took the opportunity to watch her with her guard down. He imagined that she carried herself differently when she thought no one was watching—that he could see the ‘real’ Julia underneath the layers of defenses.</p><p>“I know you’re watching me, Dean, and it’s creepy.”</p><p>Guess that theory’s shot.</p><p>“I came to see if we could mend some fences,” Dean said.</p><p>“Nothing to mend. You made it pretty clear what your intentions are regarding the scroll.”</p><p>“And now we share the biggest secret that anybody’s ever kept. The key to stopping the Devil. And that means we’re going to have to work on our trust issues.”</p><p>Wearily she looked at Dean. “I don’t have the energy to get into all of our issues.”</p><p>“The way I see it, I have no choice but to trust you.”</p><p>“Why’s that?” she asked.</p><p>“Because without your help, I’m not going to be able to stop your dad from murdering a lot of innocent people. And the only way I’ll be able to convince you to help me is to tell you the complete God’s honest truth, and that means trusting you not to flip out when you hear it.”</p><p>“I’m a big girl.”</p><p>Dean sized her up. “Not that big.”</p><p>“My dad has been working toward this his whole life. What makes you think I can convince him of anything?”</p><p>“You’re his daughter. That’s how daughters work. Look at Paris Hilton, she runs around showing off her hoo-ha and her dad just keeps refilling her checking account.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Right. See, that’s the problem. Different frames of reference.”</p><p>“Get to the point, Dean.”</p><p>“Fine. You and I are both hunters. We both have missions to complete, it’s just that... mine has taken me a little farther from home.”</p><p>“How far?”</p><p>“Fifty-six years.”</p><p>Dean could see that Julia was trying to process the information, but she gave no indication as to whether she believed it was true or not.</p><p>“Let me go back to the beginning,” Dean said.</p><p>“That would be helpful.”</p><p>“With a father like yours, you must know the story of Lucifer and Michael. Lucifer loves God more than anything else, but can’t stand his creations. Us. He doesn’t think we deserve to live in Paradise. He rebels, and big brother Michael has to put him down. Sweet family story.”</p><p>With a flick of her wrist, Julia turned off the buzzing CB radio, focusing her attention on Dean.</p><p>“Lucifer spends all his time in the pit gearing up for the rematch. But, it’s not that simple. First, he has to be let out. Second, the rematch has to take place on Earth, so he has to find the perfect meatsuit to jump into, and Michael has to find his. And here’s the kicker, their vessels... have to be brothers. ‘So it is in Heaven, so shall it be on Earth.’”</p><p>Realization began to dawn on Julia’s face. Dean hurried to finish before the inevitable questions started.</p><p>“A battle for the fate of Earth, fought by two of the names on that list in there. And it’s true, if all those bloodlines were cut, the angels would be all dressed up with no place to go. But Walter’s wrong about one thing. They’re not strangers.”</p><p>“You...”</p><p>“... and Sam. Hounded by this crap since birth. And fifty-five years from now, Lucifer will be freed. The Apocalypse will start. And we’ll find a way to stop it. Without killing hundreds of people.”</p><p>Julia turned away, pushed one step too far.</p><p>“So, let me get this straight, you’re a time-traveling angel-vessel from the future.”</p><p>“I’m the angel vessel. Michael’s.”</p><p>“And Sam... is Lucifer.”</p><p>“His vessel. Yes. But angels, even fallen ones, aren’t like demons—they need permission to come in. And Sam won’t give it.”</p><p>“If you really believe that, you wouldn’t be so desperate to find another way to stop him.”</p><p>“I trust my little brother.”</p><p>“You don’t trust anyone, Dean. Even now, you’re thinking of ways to take back everything you just said.”</p><p>“What makes you think that?”</p><p>“Because that’s what I’d be doing. This line of work isn’t designed to let people make friends. Even if they’re family.”</p><p>“Well, Sam’s all I’ve got,” Dean said. “And if you think I’m going to let Walter murder him...”</p><p>“If your story’s true, you’ve seen the start of the Apocalypse. And as a hunter, you’re not willing to do whatever it takes to stop it?”</p><p>“There’s another way. We’ll find it.”</p><p>“We go out every day and put our lives on the line for other people. This is the single biggest evil sonofabitch there ever will be, and that’s not big enough for you to lay down in front of?”</p><p>“Hunters don’t lay down. If I’m going down, I’m going down swinging.”</p><p>Julia’s mouth curled into a half-smile. “Okay.” She turned away from him. “Right answer. But... what makes you think there’s another way? Chances like this don’t come twice...”</p><p>As earnest as he’d ever been, Dean moved to look her right in the eye.</p><p>“I have to believe that there is. Your dad... he wants his destiny. Sammy and me, we don’t. Most days, I wake up and feel like running. But this is what we’re saddled with, so we’re going to find our way out from under it. But fifty-six years from now. Not today. Not like this.”</p><p>“You said you’d put your trust in me, but you’re asking me to put a hell of a lot of trust in you. I’m supposed to trust my grandchildren’s lives to you being able to punt your way out of this.”</p><p>“I thought you didn’t want the picket fence.”</p><p>“I want it, Dean, I’m just smart enough to know I’ll never get it,” she said sadly.</p><p>Dean was entirely spent. There was nothing else he could say to her that hadn’t already been said, so he went back to the beginning.</p><p>“Talk to Walter.”</p><p>She nodded, but didn’t say a word. Her facial expression was unreadable.</p><p>“We save people. We don’t murder them.”</p><p>“Let me sleep on that,” she said as she walked away.</p><p>* * *</p><p>It was late, and Dean forced himself to go to bed. There was nothing for him to do besides wait, putting him in an uncomfortably passive position. As a hunter, his tactic had always been to keep moving, to keep testing every option until he found a solution, but that rarely involved letting a woman ‘sleep on’ the most important decision of her life.</p><p>Sam was already asleep in his bed. Instinctively wary, Dean locked the door to their room and checked the windows were sealed. He trusted Julia; he had to. But now she knew that, in theory at least, Sam’s death could save the world from the Apocalypse, it didn’t hurt to take some precautions.</p><p>Despite all of the thoughts swirling in his head, the comfortable mattress and backlog of sleep deprivation quickly took its toll, and he fell asleep with his shotgun beside him.</p><p>When Dean awoke, the sun was shining brightly in through the motel window. It’s got to be least 10 a.m., he realized.</p><p>Swinging out from under the covers, Dean noticed the empty bed next to his. He had a moment of panic—where was Sam? But he pushed it aside, Sam always wakes up early. He’s probably grabbing some coffee. Stepping outside, he felt the cool morning breeze on his skin. It would have been refreshing, if he wasn’t in such a hurry to hear what Julia had to say.</p><p>Stopping outside her door, he raised his hand to knock, then thought better of it. Serious morning breath. Should have brushed before I came over. He and Julia obviously had no future together—since her future was in the distant past—but that didn’t mean Dean had given up entirely.</p><p>As he turned back toward his room, Julia’s door swung open.</p><p>“Dean,” Sam said, framed in the open doorway, a broken look on his face. “We have a problem. They’re gone, and they took the scroll.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-28">CHAPTER 28</span><a href="#chapter-28" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Throughout Dean’s life, he’d been betrayed by anyone who had got close to him. With Julia he had allowed himself to hope, even though, Dean realized, it was an idiotic notion to fall in love with someone born fifty years before him.</p><p>A burning anger bubbled up within him. He returned to their room and headed straight for the closet.</p><p>“They said they weren’t going to make any moves until we talked about it some more,” Sam said.</p><p>“Well, they lied. Seems like Walter’s plan to play a part in saving humanity means he’s going to do whatever it takes.”</p><p>“Aren’t we as well?”</p><p>Dean stared at his brother. “We’re not killing people, Sam.”</p><p>“How are we going to find them? We have no idea where they’ve gone.”</p><p>Dean held up the cord of the CB radio.</p><p>“We’re going to track them as we go.”</p><p>Twenty minutes later, they pulled into the electronics store. As they raced inside Crazy Eddie was there, smiling broadly.</p><p>“Good morning gentlemen. Can I hel—“</p><p>Dean put his hand in his face.</p><p>“We’re taking some equipment.”</p><p>Dean pulled a CB converter off the wall, and Sam grabbed a large extendable antenna. They left without saying another word to the store clerk.</p><p>“You’ve got to pay for those!” Eddie called after them.</p><p>Sam assembled the gear as Dean drove. The plan was to find the signal that Walter and Julia were using, and quickly, before they could tell anyone about the list. But chances were slim. They had no idea which direction Walter and Julia had gone in. Moreover they had no idea what kind of hunter network they were a part of. John Winchester had always taught his boys a sort of code: they might have to kill the bodies demons inhabited, but they don’t kill people. From the conversations they had had last night, it seemed that not all hunters thought that way. To Julia and Walter, the greater good was worth sacrificing some human life.</p><p>Dean gripped the steering wheel; all these things flying through his mind as they burned down the freeway.</p><p>Sam regarded his brother. Sam was pissed. Dean knew better than to get involved with someone, especially another hunter. Just at the time when the outcome of the Apocalypse would be determined by whether Sam and Dean could find away to keep Lucifer and Michael at bay, Dean decides to get involved with a chick. Sam knew his brother would never let him get away with that if the tables were reversed. Example, Ruby.</p><p>Sam fiddled with the CB radio, but all they heard were truckers all over the Midwest; not one spec of evidence that Walter and Julia were out there.</p><p>Dean pulled over for gas. They had been driving south in a crisscross fashion for hours. The new Oldsmobile they had hotwired was a gas-guzzler.</p><p>Dean hit the head at the rest stop. Staring into the mirror in the men’s room, he wondered if they would ever be able to leave 1954. Would they run into their father at some point? Would this mean that they would never be born? How long could they live in the past? Would they even age? Dean took off his jacket and set it on one of the sinks. He ran some water over his face. As he reached for his jacket, he noticed a small piece of paper hanging out of the inside breast pocket.</p><p>It was a napkin from the café across the street from the motel. On it was scribbled a little drawing that Julia had doodled while they were having coffee the previous night. It was an arch, with little stick people figures underneath it. Dean had teased Julia that she was terrible at drawing, and that he would never pick her to be on his Pictionary team. She didn’t understand the reference, but she did give him the drawing. The arch looked like it could be the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. Dean could be totally wrong, but it was the only lead they had.</p><p>“They’re in St. Louis.” Dean jumped into the driver’s seat.</p><p>“How do you know?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean held up the napkin. “Julia drew this, sort of looks like the St. Louis Arch, right? I wasn’t paying attention to what she was doing. I bet that’s where they’re based. When we called them on the CB, it took them twelve hours to get to us. It’s a twelve-hour drive to St. Louis, especially in these old cars.”</p><p>“They have a twelve-hour jump on us. Let’s get going.”</p><p>Dean hit the gas and headed due south.</p><p>Around eight hours later, as they reached the outskirts of St. Louis, they turned on the CB again.</p><p>Dean nodded toward the radio. “Flip through, see if you can’t get a higher frequency for any emergency calls.”</p><p>Sam did as he was told. Surveying the upper frequencies of the CB might lead them to any emergency calls coming into the St. Louis Police Department. If Walter and Julia were serious about killing off some of the angelic bloodlines, there probably would be some witnesses to the violence. Unless they were really, really good.</p><p>In a quiet residential street, Dean pulled over to the side of the road. It was around eight p.m., the sun was going down and several families were out for an evening stroll.</p><p>Sam diligently switched through the frequencies, going all the way up and then back down again. Then he caught it. It was faint, but they had picked up the local police radio.</p><p>They listened for more than an hour. All the police calls were for public drunkenness or the occasional domestic dispute. Dean leaned back and closed his eyes. It was going to be a long night.</p><p>Dana Mey Smith was on her hands and knees looking underneath the bed for Bertrand.</p><p>“Found him!” She appeared back at her son’s bedside with the erstwhile missing bear. “Don’t let him drop down there again,” she said with a sincere maternal voice.</p><p>Dana smoothed down the blond cowlick of her son’s hair; ever since he was born, the absurd tuft of hair had adorned her son’s forehead. If it hadn’t smoothed out in five years, she was certain it was never going to. But at least the hair’s disposition fit the popular hairstyles of the times.</p><p>“I won’t,” Cory said as he closed his eyes contentedly and turned over.</p><p>Dana tiptoed out of his room and down the stairs. At first she didn’t notice anything out of place. It was still hot in her small two-story Victorian, though she kept all the windows open all the time when it was the middle of summer like this. And she didn’t lock the door because Greg would be returning home from his shift. So it wasn’t unusual to have the long curtains move in the breeze. But as Dana turned toward the kitchen, she saw a figure outlined in the curtain. The figure was tall and dressed in black clothing with a ski mask on his face. She screamed.</p><p>He moved toward her. She screamed again and tried to run toward the back door. The man tackled her to the floor. She tried to knee him in the groin, but he was far too fast and too strong.</p><p>Dana felt her head hit the floor. A hot tingling feeling ran from her ears to her eyes.</p><p>“I don’t have any money. I don’t have any money,” she cried through her tears.</p><p>The figure put his hands around her throat and started to squeeze. She struggled at first, pulling at the fists around her neck. In a matter of thirty seconds her body went limp.</p><p>The man got up off the floor and pulled the dead body into a pantry inside the kitchen.</p><p>“Ma!” a small voice called from the front of the house.</p><p>The figure turned, his eyes shifting around the living room. He peeled off his ski mask. The man’s sandy blond hair was matted down with sweat. He put on a smile and approached the stairs. On the top of the landing was a small boy, about four or five years old. He was in his pajamas.</p><p>“Ma, Bertrand fell again.” The little boy’s eyes focused on the man in black, standing at the bottom of the stairs. “Who are you?”</p><p>“I’m a friend of your mom’s.” The man said through a plastered-on smile. “Can I help you find Bertrand?”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>The man had just stepped onto the staircase when the door flew open. A policeman stopped in his tracks, and surveyed the situation. The man opened his mouth as if to offer some excuse. That’s when the cop tackled him. Cory screamed and ran back to his room.</p><p>The man drew a knife and plunged it into the cop’s soft belly. The dead weight collapsed onto him, but he managed to roll out from underneath.</p><p>A second, younger cop appeared at the door, gun drawn. The intruder rose to his full height. The cop let loose three bullets, but two went wide, with the third passing straight through the man’s shoulder. He turned and took off through the back of the house. The cop dove over his partner in pursuit, but the man had apparently vanished into the summer night.</p><p>He returned to his partner’s side and fell to his knees. The prone cop opened his shirt to reveal the deep stab wounds. He tried to speak, but a stream of blood poured out of his mouth. His eyes rolled back. He was dead.</p><p>Sam and Dean had heard the police call. Following the patrol car to the scene, Dean left Sam waiting outside, while he headed around the side of the house.</p><p>“Dean, he’s coming through the back!” Sam yelled.</p><p>Hearing his brother, Dean jumped a fence and went around the back. That’s when he saw the man in black sprint out of the house across the backyard. Dean took off after him.</p><p>The man vaulted over a six-foot wooden fence. Dean was close behind. He reached for the guy’s black sweater. It half ripped as he pulled away, but the small delay allowed Dean to punch him in the back of the throat with his right hook. The man fell to the ground. Dean flipped him over and started pummeling him in the face.</p><p>“You a hunter? Hey, you a hunter?” Dean growled.</p><p>“Go to Hell,” the man spat.</p><p>“Been there, done that.” Dean punched the guy in the ear, knocking him out.</p><p>“Dean?” Sam hissed.</p><p>“Over here.”</p><p>Sam appeared with a flashlight. “Let’s get out of here.”</p><p>Sam took the guy’s legs and Dean wrapped his arms underneath his shoulders. They made their way to the car, opened the trunk, swiftly bound the guy’s hands and feet and roughly folded him inside.</p><p>Then they jumped into the front seats and took off.</p><p>The brothers pulled into a motel, checked in, and, under the cover of night, carried the guy into their room.</p><p>Dean threw a cup of cold water at the man’s face. He opened his eyes and tried to move.</p><p>“Hey, get these off me!” He struggled against his bonds.</p><p>“You need to answer some questions first,” Dean said.</p><p>“Screw you. You have no idea what you’re dealing with.”</p><p>Sam leaned over the guy menacingly. “You just murdered two people. We’ll be happy to let you go. I’m sure the police will completely understand as they tear you limb from limb. They have the death penalty in Missouri, Dean?”</p><p>“Please, it’s 1954, of course they do.”</p><p>“Fine, what do you want to know?” the man hissed.</p><p>“What were you doing in that woman’s house?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“I was asked to do a job. I did it.”</p><p>“Who asked you?”</p><p>“I don’t know, never saw the guy. He called me up and said he wanted some skirt laid up, and I told him my price.”</p><p>“Which is?”</p><p>“Normally I don’t like to kill ladies. But he offered me a grand.”</p><p>“A grand to kill a woman? And the kid?”</p><p>“I didn’t know there was a kid. I wasn’t going to hurt him. Honest.”</p><p>“How were you going to collect the money?”</p><p>“The guy said to call him and we would meet up.”</p><p>“You really think you were going to get paid? Do you even know where this guy lives?”</p><p>“I’m not an idiot. I got a bead on him. He’s some old guy.”</p><p>Dean’s face hardened; deep down he was still hoping their suspicions were wrong and Julia and Walter weren’t behind this. But he had a bad feeling they were right.</p><p>“Call him.” Dean grabbed the telephone off the night-stand and forced the receiver into the guy’s face.</p><p>“Um, hello? Hands are tied.”</p><p>“What’s the number?” Dean held his hand over the rotary telephone. “Come on.”</p><p>The guy recited the number. Dean put the receiver to his ear. On the other end of the line it rang, and then there was a female voice.</p><p>“Hello? Hello?”</p><p>Dean scowled—it was Julia. She and Walter had hired someone to kill the first of the angelic vessels.</p><p>“Hello? Is anyone there?” Julia said impatiently.</p><p>Sam quickly took the receiver from Dean, and put it up to the guy’s ear. He motioned for him to speak.</p><p>“Hey, it’s Grant. Deed’s done. When can we meet up?”</p><p>“One second,” the end of the line was silent for a moment. “Rick’s Drive-In. One hour. I’ll see you.”</p><p>There was a click. The guy looked up at Dean and Sam.</p><p>“Can you loosen these ropes now? I can’t feel my dick.”</p><p>Dean punched him hard in the face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-29">CHAPTER 29</span><a href="#chapter-29" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>It was around midnight, and the drive-in was hopping. Dean pulled the car into the darkest corner of the parking lot. They had bound the guy in the backseat, and tied him down.</p><p>“Hey, I can’t see. How are you going to find her?”</p><p>“We’ll find her,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean noticed a young couple making out in the car nearest to them. The windows were all steamed up.</p><p>“Very American Graffiti” he spat.</p><p>Sam leaned back and stuffed the nose of the gun into the guy’s stomach.</p><p>“Remember, if you mention one word about the kid to them, you’re dead. You understand?” Sam’s face and voice made it clear that he was completely serious.</p><p>“Yeah, man. I get it. It’s cool man,” he grunted.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Julia and Walter pulled up in a station wagon. They took an end parking space, closest to the exit. If Julia looked in her rearview she might see them, but she was engrossed in surveying the people milling under the bright lights of the drive-in’s carport.</p><p>Dean reached into the back of the car with his hunting knife and cut the cords on the guy’s wrists.</p><p>“Go get your money, scumbag.” Dean opened the back door.</p><p>The man scrambled out of the car and approached the back of Julia’s on the driver’s side. She swiveled around as he approached. Twenty yards back, Sam and Dean watched from inside their car. The guy touched his face, where Dean had repeatedly punched him. From afar, it seemed like he was making some excuse for his appearance. Julia passed over an envelope. The guy glanced back at Sam and Dean and then started walking at a rapid pace through the crowd around the driv e-in.</p><p>“You’re just going to let him go?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have bigger fish to fry,” Dean said coldly.</p><p>Dean watched Julia pull the car out of the parking lot. They followed slowly behind.</p><p>Julia turned right onto a main street and headed for downtown St. Louis. Dean stayed two car lengths behind her; he didn’t take his eyes off the station wagon.</p><p>“Dean, try to calm down. We’ll figure this out,” Sam said as tactfully and gently as he could.</p><p>“Leave me alone, Sam.” Dean gripped the steering wheel even tighter. “She just murdered an innocent woman. She’s a liar. Who knows how many other people died tonight? I’m not going to let any more people get killed because of this God-damned Apocalypse.”</p><p>Sam was silent. They drove for the next twenty minutes without speaking.</p><p>Julia pulled into a large brick industrial-era warehouse on the outside of town. She drove the car around back, so it was hidden from the street. Dean idled the car at the curb. He was perfectly still.</p><p>“Do you want me to go in?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No,” Dean said, shaking the cobwebs away. “I’m good. I got this.”</p><p>They took two shotguns, one salt-filled and one they had loaded with regular bullets, and of course Ruby’s knife.</p><p>“Let’s go,” Dean said.</p><p>He headed off into the dark toward the looming building. Sam followed close behind. They crept around the back of the structure and spotted half a dozen cars. There were no lights. But it didn’t look like anyone was lurking around. A large steel door was cut into the back of the building. Dean tried to push it, but it was locked from the inside. It would probably make too much noise to open it anyway. He spotted a six foot-long transom window, which was about nine feet off the ground and swung open from the top.</p><p>“Sam, give me a lift.”</p><p>Just then a large bear of a guy careened around the corner and barreled headfirst into Sam. Sam went down in a heap.</p><p>Dean swung at the guy with the end of his shotgun. It connected right under the guy’s chin, but only sent him stumbling back a couple of steps. Dean picked up a handful of gravel and threw it in the guy’s face, momentarily blinding him. He threw a blind swing and went down on his ass. Dean leap on top of him, and landed elbow first, smashing into the big man’s kidneys. He curled up like an infant. Dean put both hands round the guy’s throat, constricting his airway until his face turned purple. Just before the guy passed out, Dean let go. That should keep him down for a little while.</p><p>Dean held out his hand to Sam. “Come on, let’s go. Stop laying around.”</p><p>“Do you think there are more of them?” Sam asked, rubbing his head.</p><p>“That guy was big enough to be three guys. Come on. Alley-oop.”</p><p>Sam held Dean by the knee. Pushing his weight up, he managed to grasp the ledge above. In an impressive rock-climbing move, Dean swung his leg onto the cement ledge underneath the window, pulling himself so he was half inside the building and half out, balancing on his stomach.</p><p>He disappeared into the black interior of the building.</p><p>Sam was glad that the little bit of action had made Dean communicative again. When Dean was silent and brooding things could get rough.</p><p>A couple of minutes later, Dean pushed open the large steel door.</p><p>“This place is a fortress. Not good,” Dean said as he slid the steel portal closed behind Sam.</p><p>Inside the building, there was a steel staircase that led up one side. In the centre was a very large open space, and for the first time Sam noticed a pair of railroad tracks that led underneath the massive steel door. On the tracks sat an old steam engine, facing toward the door as if ready for a quick get away. The building was a large repair station for many Midwest rail lines. It didn’t look active to Sam.</p><p>Dean motioned for Sam to follow him as he slid against the wall and peered over a railing. Beneath was a basement. One side was open and the other was underneath the cement and steel floor. It allowed for about ten feet of space from the ceiling to the floor. Old steam engine parts had been pushed up against the walls and a long steel table had been placed in the middle of the basement structure. About fifty people milled about, crowding around something on the table. When the bodies parted, Sam caught a glimpse of the War Scroll laid out on the table.</p><p>A wooden door opened and Julia and Walter appeared. Dean’s eyes turned steely.</p><p>When Julia spoke, everyone quieted down.</p><p>“Thank you all for coming. First off, I’d like to say that I appreciate your sacrifice. And it will be a sacrifice, because as we go into this battle, despite our precautions, some of the people standing next to you may die. You may die. And though what we are embarking on is bloody, it is necessary. We are faced with the destruction of the Earth. To stop it there are actions that we as people, and as hunters, need to take. As you see, we have the last bit of the War Scroll, the sacred scroll written by the Essenes outlining the battle plan for the Sons of Light to overtake the Sons of Darkness.”</p><p>A murmur rose from the group.</p><p>“We were brought together decades ago for this express moment,” Julia continued. “Many of you knew my grandfather, and my grandfather knew your great grandfathers. We have waited for this moment for generations. And now it is here. We are all meant to play a part in defeating evil for the very last time. The Apocalypse we know will come. The Mayans weren’t far off; though the threat to end the world will come three years earlier than they thought. I unfortunately have intimate knowledge of this. But with this scroll we can stop it. What you see written behind the main text of the scroll is a list of names.”</p><p>All heads bowed once again to look at the scroll.</p><p>Up above, hiding in the darkness, Sam peered at his brother. Dean didn’t take his eyes off Julia as she moved around the room, almost military style. If she hadn’t been rousing people to murder, it might have been impressive.</p><p>“This is a list of names, each is a bloodline which will produce the vessels for the angels to fight Lucifer. We know that these bloodlines have been cultivated over 3,000 years by the angels, all for the impending fight with Lucifer. But, if the angels don’t have the vessels, there is no fight. Do not think of this task as extinguishing a heavenly light in this world. That’s not what we are doing. We are preventing that from happening. We are preventing the greatest fight man will ever know. We will be saving a billion lives.”</p><p>Dean watched Julia as she handed out a list of names to each hunter.</p><p>“On these pieces of paper there is a list of about fifty names, all are within your specific regions. Pass them to everyone you are working with. My father and I have already started and we have the name of Lucifer’s vessel and intend to take the appropriate action. Be careful, crafty. Dip into the funds if you need to hire someone in your stead. Do it quickly to avoid prolonged hysteria. We would like to extinguish these bloodlines by the end of the month. That gives you about ten days.</p><p>“Go out there and do this for the love of man. Good luck.”</p><p>One hunter pounded the butt of his shotgun on the table. Then another and another. The sound was a somber drum beat of death echoing through the large building. Then silence. Maps were laid out on the table. The people split into groups and the planning began.</p><p>As Julia spoke to a tall older man, she looked up into the darkness of the building, almost directly at Dean. Dean’s breath caught in his throat. Julia’s face registered a half second of recognition and then she looked back to the man in front of her.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” Dean whispered.</p><p>“We’re just going to let them do this?” Sam asked.</p><p>That’s when Dean heard it; it was far off in the distance, but the sound was unmistakable. It was the chugging of a train. The tracks below the brothers started to shake. Dean looked around—there wasn’t a Devil’s Trap to be found. How could Julia be so stupid?</p><p>Downstairs, the group fell silent, then en mass they grabbed their guns and ran up the staircase like battalions exiting u-boats.</p><p>“Turn on the lights!” someone called.</p><p>There was the clunk of a large switch being flipped and all the lights flickered on. That’s when Julia spotted Dean and Sam standing above her. Dean’s eyes met hers; Julia’s immediately welled with tears.</p><p>Outside, the engine had reached the outer edge of the train yard. It flew through the chain link fence, flinging cars out of the way like falling dominos.</p><p>The engine crashed into the steel door with such force that a six-foot-high span of bricks above the door cracked and fell to the ground. The door folded in half like an envelope. The hiss of the engine blew steam into the rafters forty feet above.</p><p>A silhouette appeared at the top of the engine.</p><p>Dean whispered, “Eisheth.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-30">CHAPTER 30</span><a href="#chapter-30" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>70 A.D. Khirbet Qumran, West Bank</p><p>The evening wind blowing in over the Dead Sea was, appropriately, as cold as death. Eisheth detested it, it whipped open the tents, and sand would kick up and cut into faces like glass, sending humans running for cover. She just about detested everything about life on Earth. After what she had seen, no one could blame her. Within the Lord’s Kingdom there was no bad weather, no wanting for food—and there certainly were no foul-smelling goats. Which wasn’t the case when living amongst the Essenes.</p><p>Her host was a girl of only eight years. At that age, children naturally demonstrate enough idiosyncratic behavior that no one noticed a little bit of demonic possession. That’s one positive thing about my new life, Eisheth thought, no more begging and pleading with vessels. “Please, it’s for the greater good,” she used to say. “It’s God’s Will. Say ‘Yes.’” The life of an angel required constantly asking for consent, and constant capitulation to the whims of others.</p><p>Demons didn’t have to ask. They took what they wanted, when they wanted it, used it up, and left what remained to rot. It suited her personality so much better.</p><p>Yet, what Eisheth wanted most, simple as it was, she could not take.</p><p>Sick of the biting gale, for after all she was in a human body and hated when it was uncomfortable, she sought shelter within one of the many canvas-walled tents that made up the majority of the settlement. The colony was substantial, but dwindling. Thousands of people, mostly men, gathered here to celebrate their shared faith... that unfortunately required them to remain celibate. How they intended to keep their faith alive into the next generation, Eisheth wasn’t sure. Her “father” had settled here after his wife died in childbirth, believing her death was his punishment for selfishly valuing his own pleasure over his God. Humans.</p><p>Inside the tent, Abaddon was already waiting.</p><p>“I don’t have long,” he said.</p><p>It took all of Eisheth’s considerable willpower to maintain her composure.</p><p>“Did he send word?” she asked. Abaddon avoided her gaze. “Of course. The Morning Star sends his deep affection...”</p><p>Not his love, she thought.</p><p>“... and wishes to know what you’ve found.”</p><p>Eisheth nodded, her cracked lips quivering.</p><p>“The prophet finishes his work as we speak.”</p><p>One half of Abaddon’s face pulled into a smile, while the other remained eerily blank.</p><p>“Where is he?”</p><p>Prophecy was laborious and frustrating, coming in fits and starts, with no set schedule and no guarantee that the results would make sense. Eisheth hated being here among the zealots of the day. Despite that, she had dutifully watched the group... for him. Finally, one of the men she was particularly close to had written something of interest. She had immediately called Abaddon.</p><p>Abaddon and Eisheth entered the cave slowly, their human eyes adjusting to the dim surroundings. The prophet sat with his back against the rock wall, a small fire burnt to embers in front of him. At his side, a set of clay jars waited to be filled and sealed.</p><p>Fear flitted across the prophet’s face as Abaddon approached.</p><p>“Who... who...” he stuttered.</p><p>Without a word, Abaddon reached out and touched the man’s forehead. He collapsed to the ground with a dull thud, his mind wiped completely of a year’s work.</p><p>“I can’t stand small talk.” Abaddon picked up the completed scroll, admiring the intricate lettering. “We should use him more often—beautiful penmanship.”</p><p>“What now?” Eisheth asked, looking for her reward. “He’s happy with what I found, isn’t he?”</p><p>Abaddon moved to pick up one of the clay jars, hefting it and feeling its weight, then putting it back down.</p><p>“Oh, very. Tickled,” he said as he clapped his hands together. For a moment, nothing happened. He looked around the cave, surprised, apparently waiting for something to appear. Once again, he clapped loudly.</p><p>From outside, a low rumble filled the air, reverberating around the cave walls and shaking loose dirt from the ceiling. A swell of black smoke surged in through the cave’s opening, dancing through the air before finding its way to one of the clay jars.</p><p>“Who was that?” Eisheth asked as Abaddon placed the lid on the jar, sealing the demon inside. “Anyone I know?”</p><p>“An insurance policy,” Abaddon responded. “Something to help you find your way.”</p><p>“My way?” she asked.</p><p>“Do you remember Lilith’s hobby?” Abaddon asked with a dark grin, clearly aware that Lilith’s name would provoke a strong response from Eisheth.</p><p>“How could I forget,” she replied, memories of Lilith’s pet fresh in her mind. It was one of many lines that Lilith had crossed that Eisheth was unwilling to. Torturing an animal, twisting it into something unnatural, for no reason other than her own amusement. “The dog.” She hated the dog.</p><p>“I love that dog,” Abaddon said.</p><p>“So does Lilith. Why would she give him up?”</p><p>“Because he asked her to.”</p><p>Eisheth swallowed reflexively.</p><p>“He knew you’d need it.”</p><p>The pieces weren’t connecting for Eisheth. She had read the prophecy, though she didn’t fully understand the text. She knew that the battle it described was thousands of years in the future. What she didn’t know was the role that she was destined to play.</p><p>“I want to see him,” she said, desperation seeping into her voice. It had been years. How many, she didn’t know. It felt like thousands. “I need to see him.”</p><p>“I’m afraid you have a different destiny.”</p><p>Words had never had a more sinister edge. Eisheth backed away from Abaddon as he lifted the lid from another jar. His finger circled the rim, searing an Enochian sigil into the clay. Eisheth recognized the angelic script instantly. It reminded her of home—her first home. Heaven. Looking at Abbandon, this was beginning to feel like a terrible mistake.</p><p>Perhaps wholly trusting Abaddon wasn’t a wise move, he was a fallen angel after all. They were crafty, not single-minded like herself, a demon. Perhaps she shouldn’t have had her lust move her feet into blind submission to Abaddon’s direction.</p><p>In that moment, she pondered the extent of God’s forgiveness. If he could forgive humans for their vanity, their cruelty and their lust, surely he could forgive her. Surely love wasn’t so abhorrent a sin—</p><p>The thought ended there with a flick of Abaddon’s wrist. Eisheth’s soul, blackened by its union to Lucifer, jetted out of the young girl’s mouth in terrible, choking spasms.</p><p>Husband, why have you forsaken me?</p><p>She wouldn’t get her answer for nearly 2,000 years.</p><p>1954 A.D., St. Louis, Missouri</p><p>Didn’t see that coming, Dean thought.</p><p>Standing atop the engine, the demon’s eyes flared crimson—it was as if the blood pumping in her host’s veins was visible through her pupils.</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a harried glance, both understanding that any chance of peacefully defusing the situation had perished with the arrival of Eisheth and her horde.</p><p>From within the train, her demonic followers began to appear. First, a pair from the conductor’s hatch, clambering out and over the twisted steel that once was the building’s door. Next, a bald-headed man leapt with inhuman agility out of one of the cargo compartments. A veritable flood followed them—Dean counted about a hundred demons, every one of them moving into position around the assembled hunters. Reflected light from the glowing fire glimmered in their ebony eyes.</p><p>“Everybody stay back,” Dean shouted, trying his best to take command of the situation before someone tipped its delicate balance. His thoughts flipped quickly between regret—for having created the quagmire in the first place— and anger, directed squarely at Julia and Walter for fanning the flames.</p><p>To Dean’s chagrin, Walter shoved his way through the crowd of hunters and stood before Eisheth.</p><p>“You don’t know what you’ve walked into, demon,” he called out to her.</p><p>Chuckling, Eisheth squinted at Walter.</p><p>“Aren’t you a sad little creature,” she cackled. “Puffing out your chest like a man.”</p><p>If he was offended by the jab, Walter didn’t show it.</p><p>“Seems to me, this is about the worst place you could find yourself. Going head to head with the only people on this Earth who know how to kill you.”</p><p>Behind him, over a dozen of his compatriots formed into a rough phalanx, preparing for the inevitable fight.</p><p>With a look to her followers, Eisheth indicated for them to move forward.</p><p>“I am willing to find an equitable arrangement,” she said. “Give me the scroll, and we’ll only kill...” She trailed off, scanning the crowd, finally pointing a threatening finger at Julia. “Her.”</p><p>Dean bristled, and jostled his way through the crowd to stand next to Walter.</p><p>“Listen, bitch, we’ve heard about enough from you,” he growled.</p><p>Sam followed him out of the throng, taking up a defensive position next to his brother. Walter noticed and immediately stepped away from him. Julia must have told him everything, Dean realized. Of course, by now he’s had time to translate the entire list, so he could have found out about us on his own.</p><p>“Samuel Winchester,” Eisheth snarled. “I thought you, of all people, would understand what a mistake this is. Do you honestly believe you’ll be allowed to succeed?”</p><p>“We’re not afraid of you,” Walter said. His eyes shifted nervously between her and Sam, betraying the bravado in his words.</p><p>Eisheth ignored him, and continued to address Sam.</p><p>“As if your name isn’t on that list. Do you really think the angels will let you destroy their entire stock of vessels?”</p><p>Sam remained silent. Now it was Julia who stepped forward.</p><p>“We don’t give a damn what you or the angels think,” she said. “This is our planet, and we’re not going to let you destroy it.”</p><p>“Samuel. I’m speaking to you.” Eisheth glared at him. “Not the riff-raff.”</p><p>Behind Sam, Walter nodded toward several of the hunters. They pointed their rifles at Sam. Another set raised theirs toward Eisheth and her horde.</p><p>“Ah. I see. We have ourselves a little intraspecies squabble.” Eisheth smiled at Sam. “And you were such fast friends the last time we saw each other. What happened? Somebody find out your little secret?”</p><p>She addressed the group. “You really should be bowing before him, not pointing guns at his back. Do you realize how perfect a specimen he is? Do you know what kind of strength it takes to house an archangel?”</p><p>“He’s a freak,” Walter declared. “Just like you. Now why don’t you take your little circus and leave town? Can’t promise not to catch up with you, but I’ll give you a head start.”</p><p>“Things sure have changed since I was bottled up,” Eisheth said. “2,000 years ago, people had so much faith that they refused to marry. Thought it would take up too much of their prayer time. Now look at you.”</p><p>“You want to talk about faith?” Walter cried furiously. “You’re a monster! A blight on God’s creation.”</p><p>“If you cared about God’s creation, you’d let Him do with it as He wished. If He wants to take His ball and go home, let Him. Except in this case, He wants to smash His ball to pieces.”</p><p>“He wants me to save it,” Walter said with fervor.</p><p>“Please,” Eisheth said exasperated. “You? Look at you! You think you’re important enough to be part of God’s plan?”</p><p>Blood rushed to Walter’s face. Dean could see the fury in his eyes, every taunt bringing him closer to breaking point.</p><p>“Enough!” Sam shouted, stepping between Eisheth and Walter. “Walter, you think you’ve figured out what part you have to play, but trust me, you don’t want to play a part. It’s hell. And it’s not fair. I don’t want anything to do with Lucifer, and I’m going to do my damnedest to avoid it, but those are the cards I was dealt. Maybe the cards you got let you sit this one out. Maybe you have something else to do with your life, besides throwing it away trying to stop the inevitable.”</p><p>Dean shot Sam a look. Inevitable? What was he saying? That he knew he’d have to say yes to Satan eventually?</p><p>“Glad you’ve accepted that, Sam,” Eisheth stated.</p><p>She stepped off the roof of the train engine and dropped, landing with a thud on the cracked flooring.</p><p>“If you wish it... I will spare them.”</p><p>Sam and Dean both recoiled in shock. What did that crazy broad just say?</p><p>“In exchange for one thing.”</p><p>Of course, Dean thought. Of course there’s a catch.</p><p>After a moment’s hesitation, Sam said quietly, “What?”</p><p>“When the time comes, and Lucifer is finally freed... I want you to kill Lilith. Before you say yes to Lucifer, considering you won’t have much of a say in things after that.”</p><p>Sam’s face went slack. Was she serious? Did she really not know?</p><p>Shaking his head, Sam backed away from her.</p><p>“No. I—I can’t.”</p><p>Eisheth fumed. “Fine. Don’t say I didn’t give you a choice.”</p><p>She held up her hand, getting the attention of the demons around her. Then she brought her hand down, toward Walter and Julia’s army.</p><p>“Wait! Sam. Sammy,” Dean cried out. “You can reconsider, right? Seems like killing Lilith might be something you’re into.” He shot Sam a big-eyed look, hoping that his little brother would realize how stupid he was being. Lie to her, dumbass! Give Walter and Julia a chance to tuck their tails between their legs and run, then we can deal with this the old-fashioned way.</p><p>Eisheth motioned to her demons, stopping them, and waited for Sam to respond.</p><p>“Why do you care?” Dean asked, trying to draw her out while he figured out a plan.</p><p>“Guess my story didn’t make it into your copy of the Bible,” she barked angrily. “I was an angel. I was supposed to be up there, among the Heavenly Host, deciding all of your pathetic little fates. But I made one mistake. Loved an angel I wasn’t supposed to, and look where it got me.” She indicated the pack of fiends behind her. “Lilith, a damned human, comes in and pushes me out, so I ripped out my grace and became human for him, too. But even that wasn’t enough. It was as if Lucifer only had space in Hell for one of us.”</p><p>“Sounds like Lucifer’s not your biggest fan then, if he let that happen,” Dean said.</p><p>His words caused Eisheth’s jaw to grind. “You don’t know what you’re talking about. She did what humans do. She manipulated, schemed, and back-stabbed until she had the support of his... caretaker.” She paused, then added, without much conviction, “Lucifer never stopped loving me.”</p><p>“I bet.”</p><p>“When this was discovered, it was I who brought it to Abaddon’s attention,” she said, pointing at the list which was still laid out on the table, “because I was the better wife. More loyal than Lilith. I gave everything up for him. I told Abaddon that.”</p><p>“Wait, Abaddon?” Dean said, his head reeling. How could that be true? Who was Abaddon loyal to—Heaven or Hell?</p><p>Eisheth smiled cruelly. “You know him?”</p><p>Dean looked at the floor, considering the options. One: she was lying. She was a demon, after all. Two: Abaddon was a spy infiltrating the bad camp 2,000 years ago, and that’s how he knew Eisheth. Three: Abaddon was bad and always had been, or his true motives were too complicated for Dean to ever figure out, and he was best left going with his gut, which at this juncture was telling him to kill Eisheth and run.</p><p>“You’d remember him if you’d met him. He’s not exactly a charmer.”</p><p>“I don’t doubt that,” Sam interjected. “But what does he have to do with the scroll?”</p><p>“Look who’s chatty now,” Eisheth said. “Abaddon was the one that told me I would be in Lucifer’s favor for showing him the scrolls. He was the only link I had to a very absent husband. And he’s the bastard who sealed me in the jar.”</p><p>Sam and Dean shared a wary look. At the moment, they were facing a firing squad on one side, a bitter old demon and her lackeys on another, and if they ever found their way home, an angel gone bad would be waiting for them. So, it was a lot like any other day.</p><p>“I spent 2,000 years in that damn jar, puzzling over what it all meant, why my husband would let that happen. And I think I’ve figured it out.”</p><p>“Yeah? What’s that?” Dean said. As Eisheth related her story, he was busy scanning the room for something that would give them an advantage. But as he currently saw it, there were over a hundred demons, and just over fifty hunters. The hunters had guns, the demons were almost impossible to kill. If Eisheth was anywhere near as powerful as Lilith, the advantage was certainly on her side.</p><p>“The task I’ve been given, it’s a test. I stop you, and I’ve proven my worth. Lucifer wants nothing more than to have a fight. I’m here to make sure he gets it. The vessels must be preserved.”</p><p>“After all he put you through, you’re still doing his chores?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I love him.” It seemed that to Eisheth, it was as simple as that. No matter what had happened to her, what she had been forced into, her mind was made up.</p><p>“This is insane,” Dean said with vitriol. “We’re talking about thousands of lives. It’s not a test; it’s not a special destiny. It’s about right and wrong, and damn if the demon isn’t right this time. I have no intention of letting Michael and Lucifer fight it out, not with the whole world hanging in the balance, but I’m not going to give up on doing the right thing just to take the easy way out. There’s an easy fix for all of us. Walk the hell away—“</p><p>Before Eisheth could respond, Walter stepped forward and placed a rock salt shotgun firmly to her temple.</p><p>“Dad! No!” Julia cried out, rushing toward her father, but it was too late. In a blur of motion, Eisheth slammed her fist into his ribcage, instantly shattering it. He reeled from the blow, his shotgun blasting uselessly into the air as the demon dove at him, gripping him firmly by the neck.</p><p>With a sickening crack, she ended his life. His body went limp and she let it drop to the floor. For all his talk about destiny, Walter had ended up deciding his own fate.</p><p>“Kill them all. Except for Samuel.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-31">CHAPTER 31</span><a href="#chapter-31" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean fired a round of bullets at the surrounding demons, creating a haze of smoke and salt. Bodies keeled over. Sam slashed a couple with Ruby’s knife. The demons’ wounds flashed a hellfire orange as they were dispatched into nothingness.</p><p>While Eisheth was distracted, Dean ran to Walter’s body. Figuring the old man would not have let go of those precious last pages of the scroll, he patted him down and sure enough found them in his breast pocket.</p><p>“Sorry old man. I hope it was worth it,” he said, carefully pulling out the papers and pocketing them.</p><p>The fight raged around him, the air filled with shotgun blasts and the screams of hunters as the demons overcame them. The hunters were fighting back but there were just too many demons. It’s a massacre, Dean thought, and there’s nothing we can do to save them.</p><p>Through the chaos he spied Julia. In a rage of grief she was drop-kicking, stabbing and shooting at demons from all sides, but they were closing in. Fighting his way through the maelstrom, Dean grabbed hold of her. She struggled against him as he pulled her down the steel staircase to the room underneath the engine work floor.</p><p>Sam stood at the bottom of the staircase and shot rounds of salt over their heads.</p><p>Eisheth turned back around and saw Dean disappear down the staircase.</p><p>“Come on Winchesters,” she cried, standing tall and bloody amongst the dead and dying hunters, surrounded by her horde. “I just want to talk.”</p><p>They barricaded themselves in an ante-room which led off the basement.</p><p>“So now what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Is there another way out of here?” Dean asked Julia, who stood immobile, staring at the floor.</p><p>He grasped her by the shoulders.</p><p>“Julia! Is there another way out of here?”</p><p>She looked up. “I killed him.”</p><p>“No, you didn’t. Walter died for what he believed in. No one was going to convince him otherwise, not even you. Now we have to find a way out of here.”</p><p>Dean looked around the room. “What is this place?”</p><p>Crates and sacks were stacked up against every wall of the rectangular room. A distinct pungent odor hung in the air. The only fresh ventilation was coming through a large grate in the ceiling.</p><p>Dean pried open a crate and looked inside. Dynamite.</p><p>“That explains the reinforced steel door,” Sam said, looking over his shoulder. “I bet this was used as some sort of hub when they built the Atlantic Pacific Railroad. They’d need explosives to grade earth and create suitable terrain for the rail lines.”</p><p>“Now I feel bad about taking away your Thomas the Train toy.” Dean glanced witheringly at his brother. “This stuff must be like seventy years old. Do you think it still works?”</p><p>There was a loud bang at the door, then another. The demons were trying to get in. Each impact dented the steel a bit more. It was only a matter of time.</p><p>“We’re not going to have time to find out,” Sam said, guarding the door. “Let’s get these things unpacked.”</p><p>Minutes later the trio were hard at work. Julia was stringing detonation wire between the crates of dynamite, and Sam and Dean were ripping open all the various sacks of chemicals and gunpowder. By the time they were done they were knee deep in explosives.</p><p>The demons continued to work on the steel door, it was beginning to tear like tin foil.</p><p>“Let’s get out of here,” Dean said, unscrewing the bolts on the ventilation shaft.</p><p>A faint scratching sound could be heard coming from above.</p><p>“Did they get inside there? That’s our only way out,” Julia said nervously, looking up into the darkness between the metal slats.</p><p>“We’ve got no choice now. I’ll go first. Julia second. Sam, you cover the back and lay the wire as we go.”</p><p>Dean stood on a chair and lifted himself into the vent. He pulled Julia up behind him. Sam managed to bury the denotation wire in the explosives below. The demons were almost all the way through the door when Sam lifted himself up into the shaft and hastily put the grid back on it.</p><p>They crawled through the ventilation shaft on their hands and knees. It ran underneath the engine work floor and every twenty feet or so it changed direction. They soon felt like they were going in circles.</p><p>“Are you sure you know where this is going?” Julia asked.</p><p>“It has to lead somewhere,” Dean said. The enclosed box shape of the duct-work made Dean uneasy, it reminded him of being stuck in a coffin after his death. “This is so not good for my claustrophobia.”</p><p>Sam was bringing up the rear, sliding his shotgun in front of him and then crawling up to meet it. The action made a lulling swish-swish sound. But then he heard the distinct screech of metal scraping against metal.</p><p>“Dean, I think you need to speed it up a bit,” Sam called ahead.</p><p>“I’m going as fast as I can.”</p><p>“I think they just got into the vent.”</p><p>“Damn it.”</p><p>“Hurry!” Sam called. He could hear the demons getting closer.</p><p>Sam took the right turn behind Julia, but his leg wouldn’t move. He looked back. A demon, a man in overalls, smiled a toothless grin at him.</p><p>“Where you goin’ pretty boy?”</p><p>Sam flipped onto his back and shot the man between the eyes in one motion. The salt pellet burned into the demon’s head. Smoke escaped from his mouth, sped across the top of the ventilation shaft and disappeared out of the grate.</p><p>“Dean, we need to get out of here!”</p><p>Dean slid underneath the grating that led to the outside. He crouched down then pushed it with his back. It wouldn’t budge.</p><p>“It’s stuck!”</p><p>“I have a whole load of demons on my ass. Figure something out!”</p><p>Dean pushed again. The grate gave a bit, then a little more. He scrambled up and disappeared outside.</p><p>Another demon quickly crawled toward Sam. He spun and shot it in the heart.</p><p>Julia clambered out of the grate ahead of Sam.</p><p>Sam managed to follow her, squeezing through the opening just as more demonic black eyes appeared out of the darkness.</p><p>He found himself standing on a grassy patch about fifty yards away from the engine warehouse.</p><p>Dean started shooting salt rounds into the hole Sam had just vacated. He yelled at Julia over his shoulder.</p><p>“Get that car over here.” He pointed at a car parked on the street twenty feet away.</p><p>“Let’s get the grate back over it,” Sam said, indicating the hole.</p><p>They pulled the iron grate onto the hole just as three more demonic faces appeared below them.</p><p>“Suck it, bitches.” Dean smiled.</p><p>“I don’t think that’s going to hold,” Sam said.</p><p>An engine roared. From behind the wheel of the car, Julia motioned for them to get out of the way. She stopped directly over the grate. They could see the demons trying to push the grate open, but it would only move so far up against the undercarriage of the automobile.</p><p>Sam pulled the detonation wire about ten feet from the car.</p><p>“Find some cover,” Dean called to Julia.</p><p>Julia exited the car and took cover behind another car parked on the dark street.</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. “Let’s hope this works.”</p><p>Sam lit the detonation wire. It sparked, then fizzled out.</p><p>“Aww, come on! Let me try.” Dean took the Zippo from his younger brother and tried lighting the wire, but it refused to ignite.</p><p>“It’s too old,” Dean said. “Eisheth’s still in there. Let’s light that bitch up.”</p><p>“Someone has to go in and light it some other way. I’ll do it,” Sam said.</p><p>“Sam, no. No telling what Eisheth will do to you if she catches you.”</p><p>“Let me do it. I started this.”</p><p>“It’s a suicide mission.”</p><p>“It’s not like that. We need to kill Eisheth, she’s leading the charge in there. Those poor possessed people are already dead. We need to put them out of their misery.”</p><p>Dean nodded his head, his brother was right.</p><p>Sam took the Zippo from Dean.</p><p>“Wish me luck.”</p><p>He ran off toward the warehouse.</p><p>Sam peeked through a dusty window—the warehouse was crawling with demons. Eisheth had somehow recruited yet more. The bodies of the hunters were littered across the floor, not one of them was still standing. Poor people, Sam thought, all of them thought they were on their way to fulfilling some sort of destiny, and they all died today. Because of me.</p><p>Sam kicked open the window and climbed inside. He stealthily made his way to the steel staircase. The basement was full of demons all still fighting to get into the anteroom where they had been holed up. Sam looked around for something to light. He saw an old piece of rope and an empty beer bottle. Sam took some oil from a can and poured it into the beer bottle, then he dipped the rope into the oil and shoved that into the top of the bottle.</p><p>“I was hoping we would get a little one-on-one time,” a voice said.</p><p>Sam spun around to see Eisheth leaning suggestively against the dead body of a hunter splayed over a piece of machinery. She smiled and sauntered toward him.</p><p>“I have to say, Lucifer did well. He always had good taste. You’ll soon find that out.” Eisheth reached her hand up to touch Sam’s face. “We are going to have such fun together.”</p><p>Sam pulled away. “You disgust me. You should’ve stayed in your genie bottle.”</p><p>“Oh, come now, Sam. Aren’t you even a little bit happy to see me? I’m happy to see you. I was cooped up for so long in that jar. I had plenty of time to fantasize about what vessel Lucifer would pick for himself when he rose. And, my oh my, I am glad it’s someone so tall. You know... when Lilith wasn’t around,” Eisheth pressed up close to Sam, “Lucifer and I did some wonderful things together. Would you like me to show you?”</p><p>She trailed her fingers over Sam’s chest and down toward his belt buckle.</p><p>“Maybe in my next lifetime.”</p><p>Eisheth laughed. “You are a comedian, aren’t you? Don’t you understand? I’m your future wife. Maybe not in this body, but I’ll make sure she’s really nice and young. You’d like that, wouldn’t you? In fifty years, when Lucifer is out and inside you... Well, let’s just say I can’t wait to get back to playing our old games.”</p><p>Eisheth leaned in to kiss Sam. Sam took a step, spun around and simultaneously lit and threw the bottle into the basement and right at the ante-room door. A couple of demons were blown apart in the quick flare up. It would only be a matter of time before the entire room went up.</p><p>Eisheth grabbed Sam by the neck, and threw him up against a wall.</p><p>“You think I care about a hundred lesser demons? Burn them all. I just care about you, Samuel. I want you to be safe.”</p><p>Sam pushed himself up and lunged at Eisheth. With the demon knife, he slashed at her belly. She moved away with a quick step.</p><p>“Silly boy, you can’t kill me. I’m over 2,000 years old.”</p><p>Eisheth threw up her hand and Sam went flying fifty feet through the air, landing at the base of the steam engine. His head cracked against the iron.</p><p>“Now look what you made me do. I didn’t want to hurt this perfect specimen.”</p><p>Eisheth strode toward him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-32">CHAPTER 32</span><a href="#chapter-32" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What’s taking him so long?” Dean asked.</p><p>Dean and Julia were hidden behind a car, waiting for the four-story brick building to blow.</p><p>Without warning, the windows blew out, and hot mercury-colored glass shot in all directions.</p><p>There was a rumble, and then another blast as more fire exploded from the windows and roof of the building. Its seven-story smoke stack started to sway. There were a series of smaller percussions which rattled windows in the surrounding buildings. Then everything was silent for a moment.</p><p>A sizzling noise came from within the damaged structure, like a thousand tons of bacon frying. A blast like a mini atom bomb shot up into the air, crumbling the fifty-foot walls and sending flaming debris a hundred yards in all directions.</p><p>Dean looked at the destroyed shell of foundation.</p><p>“Sam?” he said in a small voice.</p><p>Then, against the light of the burning inferno, a silhouette appeared. Sam? The figure gradually revealed itself to be Eisheth. She strode up to them, dragging Sam’s body behind her.</p><p>Dean leveled his shotgun at her.</p><p>“He’s not dead, don’t worry. I’m as upset as you are. His body is so magnificent. I told him I can’t wait until I get to explore it all over.”</p><p>“Put him down,” Dean commanded.</p><p>Eisheth dropped Sam face first onto the gravel.</p><p>“What would you like to do now? I did my job. I stopped all those holier-than-thou hunters from killing the vessels.”</p><p>“You killed my father!” Julia shouted.</p><p>Eisheth regarded Dean with a smirk.</p><p>“Really, this whiney little mouse is attractive to you? Okay, listen sweetheart, I had a job to do. I had to stop all you blood-filled air suckers from thinking you are doing God’s work. If you only knew. From my perspective, God created a hot, dry, dusty, famine-filled world for you. Why would you ever want to help his cause?”</p><p>“Hey, Sigourney, can you stop playing Gate Keeper for a moment, and let’s get this over with,” Dean shouted over the roar of the fire.</p><p>“Just one more thing, then I’ll get out of your hair. I need the last pages of the scroll. My job is to protect those names, and I’m not letting anyone else get any crazy ideas about killing off the vessels, especially now I’ve met my husband’s. I’m talking to you, mouse.”</p><p>Julia stepped out from behind the car and leveled her gun at Eisheth. A lightning quick unseen force pulled Julia toward Eisheth. She flew through the air and landed unconscious at Eisheth’s feet. The demon knelt down and picked her up by the hair, examining her face.</p><p>“Nice face, but a little petite, don’t you think? Oh, and by the way, thanks for this. It’s like a token from my homeland. Makes me nostalgic for all those sacrifices people used to do.”</p><p>Eisheth held the demon knife at Julia’s throat.</p><p>“I know. She’s definitely not like me, but she will bleed regardless. I’m going to have so much fun with this knife. Do you know what I’m going to be able to do with it?” Eisheth dropped Julia and began ranting and gesticulating with the knife like it was a piece of chalk held by a professor. “I can kill off all Lucifer’s precious little demons. I’ll be able to slaughter each and every one. Then he’ll have to listen to me.”</p><p>Dean had to think fast.</p><p>“What’s your plan?” he said. “You reckon killing demons is going to make your absent husband take you more seriously? You can boil little bunnies Glenn Close-style all you want, Lucifer has bigger fish to fry. You’re just a distraction to him. Second fiddle. He’s Tiger Woods and you’re just another cocktail waitress to text message.”</p><p>“Are those the last words your true love is going to hear you say?” Eisheth spat. “Fine with me.”</p><p>Grabbing her hair, Eisheth lifted Julia’s body off the ground. She pushed her neck back and held the knife to her throat again.</p><p>“What if we could make you a deal?” Dean asked, eyeing the glinting blade as she pressed it to Julia’s skin.</p><p>“What could you possibly have that I would have the slightest bit of interest in?”</p><p>“We can take you to Lucifer. Now. You won’t have to wait.”</p><p>That made Eisheth pause.</p><p>“It seems like you haven’t had a face-to-face with your hubby in a long time. Maybe now is the time to try to get into couples therapy?”</p><p>“I don’t like the way you talk.”</p><p>“You’re a smart chick. Despite those 2,000 birthday candles on your cake, I know you get it.” Dean smirked.</p><p>“Someone broke the seals?” Eisheth asked.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. Seemed everyone thought it was impossible.</p><p>“Someone broke the seals. Lilith did, to be exact, and she’s gone.”</p><p>Eisheth’s eyes glowed brightly, the thought of her husband unfettered, free of his favorite wife, was the consolation and redemption she had been waiting for.</p><p>Dean needed to rope her in quick.</p><p>“Lucifer is walking around just like you and me. But there’s a catch— it’s fifty-six years in the future. But we have a way to get you there.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“All things come to those who wait. You need to do something for us first.”</p><p>“I don’t do favors.”</p><p>Dean looked at her steadily. “You’ll do this one. Just let Julia go.”</p><p>Eisheth looked down at Julia’s limp body.</p><p>“Fine,” she said, dropping her to the ground. “What do I have to do?”</p><p>“First things first, we have a couple of stops.”</p><p>“Where’d you say you found me?” Leanne Keeny asked.</p><p>“Wandering around St. Louis. You don’t remember anything?” Dean shot her a sideways glance as he negotiated the country dirt road.</p><p>“I thought I went to New York. I got a job, I think. It was my first day. That’s the last thing I remember.”</p><p>“You’re a lucky girl. Is this it?” Dean turned the car up a long driveway leading to a white clapboard farmhouse. “Nice place. I’m sure your parents will be happy to see you.”</p><p>“They weren’t expecting me until Christmas.”</p><p>“Leanne, do me a favor. Stay here on the farm. Raise a family. You don’t need to go to New York to have a good life.”</p><p>She shrugged. “Guess you’re right. Besides, New York was awfully expensive.”</p><p>“There you go. Smart girl.”</p><p>Leanne flashed him a big smile as she got out of the car. She shut the door and leaned in through the open window.</p><p>“So,” she hesitated, “maybe you and me could go get a float sometime.”</p><p>“Sorry sweetheart, I’m not the settling-down type.” Dean winked, put the car into reverse and peeled off down the driveway.</p><p>Leanne Keeny took a long look at her parents’ farmhouse and then ran inside.</p><p>Hours later, Dean pulled into the Twin Pines Motel in Waubay. He parked the car. Julia appeared in the doorway of a cabin. Dean couldn’t take his eyes off her.</p><p>“Where’s Sam?” he asked as he shut the car door.</p><p>“He’s in a cabin. Sleeping, of all things. Are you sure about all this?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “I’m never sure about anything. But we had to take the risk. Besides, she had a knife to your throat.”</p><p>“Thank you for saving my life.” Julia looked up into Dean’s eyes.</p><p>He put his arms around her waist and gently pushed her into the cabin, closing the door behind him with his foot.</p><p>Dean gently slid onto the bed, pulling Julia with him.</p><p>“I’m so sorry for everything,” Julia said as she smoothed her hands over Dean’s chest. “Everything I believed in, everyone I’ve ever known... is gone.”</p><p>Dean gazed into her eyes for a moment. It was true that Julia’s life was forever changed. She had lost her father, all of the hunters who were her friends; she had lost her way of life. Dean thought about how hard it would be to go back to living a normal existence. Would there always be an itching to be on the road? Dean didn’t know any other life. But Julia, she was different.</p><p>“You’re free, Julia. You’re now free to do what you want.”</p><p>Julia pulled back to look at him. “What I want is to be with you.”</p><p>“That can’t happen. You know that.”</p><p>Julia nodded sadly and laid her head on Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>In the early dawn, Dean woke up. As quietly as possible, he crept out of bed, gathered his clothing up off the floor, lingered a moment at the door, then left.</p><p>He walked into the other cabin, where Sam was apparently still sleeping.</p><p>“You awake? We need to do this.”</p><p>Sam sat up in bed. He was already dressed. He nodded and followed Dean out into the parking lot. They walked west into a field by the motel. Dean took the last couple of pages of the War Scroll from inside his leather jacket. Holding them up by one corner, he lit his Zippo and the flame caught the parchment. In a matter of seconds the pages had curled up like black tongues licking up the fire.</p><p>As the last bit of the War Scroll disappeared into ash, there was a bright flash of light.</p><h2><span id="chapter-33">CHAPTER 33</span><a href="#chapter-33" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Castiel had told Dean many times about the difficulty of moving objects through time. How it exhausted him, and left him barely able to think, much less fight. Dean was beginning to learn, from first-hand experience, that it was also true for the traveler. As the 1954 world flashed out of existence around him, a deep, gurgling something bubbled up in his stomach. He mentally prepared himself for the possibility that he’d puke when they got back to 2010. God, I hope it comes up as puke, not out the other side.</p><p>When the world re-formed, Dean was no longer standing. He was sitting in the back booth of the Waubay bar, a cheeseburger and a freshly poured beer waiting on the table in front of him. Sam was seated next to him, uncomfortably close.</p><p>“You want to give me some breathing room?” Dean scooted sideways slightly.</p><p>Sam didn’t respond. He just tapped the glass in front of him, as if it wasn’t real.</p><p>“Hey, you want to sit on a guy’s lap, wait till Christmas,” Dean said.</p><p>Finally, Sam slid out of the booth and stood up, surveying the rest of the room.</p><p>“Do you see him?”</p><p>Dean looked around the bar. Don, or Abaddon, or whoever the hell he was, apparently hadn’t stuck around to greet them.</p><p>“Dude zapped us back. Gotta be around here somewhere.” Remembering their earlier encounter, Dean looked toward the back of the bar. “Check the bathroom. Guy has a woman’s bladder. Then we’ll check outside.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the bathroom’s only occupant was a large Peruvian man, who incidentally did not like having his privacy invaded. Sam learned that lesson very quickly, much to Dean’s amusement.</p><p>As they left the bar, Dean saw something that nearly brought a tear to his eye. The Impala, in all its glory, rested under a nearby oak tree.</p><p>“Aren’t you a sight for sore eyes,” he said, running his fingers over the cool metal of the hood.</p><p>“Why are you stroking a car?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Give me a break, I haven’t seen her in weeks.”</p><p>“Her?”</p><p>Dean was distracted when he noticed a white spot on the windshield. That’s when it hit him —something was seriously wrong here.</p><p>“Didn’t park it here,” he said, mostly to himself.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“I left the car at the motel. We... we got zapped back from the motel, not the bar. The Impala shouldn’t be here.”</p><p>He pointed at the white spot. “And when have I ever parked her under a tree, where birds can... do things on her?”</p><p>“Sorry about that, Dean. I moved it for you,” Abaddon’s voice called out from behind them. “Thought you’d appreciate a welcome home meal, rather than a stuffy motel room.”</p><p>“That’s awfully nice of you, Donny, but why don’t you cut the crap?”</p><p>Abaddon hung his head, as if in shame.</p><p>“Ah. So I take it your trip didn’t go well?”</p><p>“You know exactly how it went. You knew all along what we were going to find, and what we’d have to do when we found it.”</p><p>“You know, Dean, you really should let your baby bro get a word in edgewise sometimes. I think he’d really appreciate it.” Don looked amused.</p><p>Sam was apparently speechless with anger. His face had contorted in rage at the sight of Abaddon.</p><p>“See, he looks a little... piqued.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about him,” Dean said. “Worry about me, and what I’m going to do to you. What the angels are going to do to you when they find out you’ve been batting for the other side.”</p><p>“Oooooh. I’m scared.” Abaddon shielded his face in mock alarm. “Don’t tell Daddy on me. Oh wait, my dad’s dead. Gone to wherever omnipotent but lazy deities go when they finally get bored with their creations and abandon ship.”</p><p>“So what, now you kill us? Put us through the funhouse and then slit our throats when we find our way out?”</p><p>“Buddy, you’re not getting the lesson at all.”</p><p>“What can I say. I’m a drop-out.”</p><p>“That’s fine, since it’s not really for you to get, anyway. It’s for our good friend over here.” He nodded toward Sam.</p><p>“Tell me if you’ve heard this before: You’re going to say yes. And it’s not because you’ll be tricked, or because you’ll be forced. It’s because the other options don’t work. Not for you.”</p><p>“You don’t know all our options,” Dean retorted.</p><p>“I just gave you a great one. And what did you do? You went out of your way to keep things the way they are. You got your friend killed to save Lucifer.”</p><p>“We didn’t kill anybody.”</p><p>“Honestly, it’s a win-win for us either way,” Abaddon continued. “If you’d tried to kill all those vessels, you would have failed. You would have moped and felt terrible for trying, and we would have ended up in this exact same place, only you’d be one step closer to damnation. Like it or not, all three of us know that the fight is inevitable. And that’s why you did what you did.”</p><p>Sam could no longer hold his silence.</p><p>“You pretend that you thought of everything, that the outcome was determined before you set things in motion.”</p><p>Abaddon turned to Sam, a little disconcerted by his calm tone. And there was something else in his voice as well. Abaddon frowned slightly.</p><p>“But you’ve left a loose string,” Sam said. “You forgot about my destiny.”</p><p>“Your destiny... is with Lucifer.” Abaddon seemed suddenly uncertain.</p><p>Sam smiled broadly. It was so out of character in that moment that it even rattled Dean.</p><p>“That’s more true than you know,” Sam said. “And when I’m finally returned to him, I’ll be sure to tell him how easily you were fooled.” Sam’s eyes flashed red.</p><p>“Eisheth.” The truth hit Abaddon heavily. It looked as if the air had been pressed from his lungs.</p><p>Dean’s heart was racing. They had taken an awful risk, and so far it had paid off. With any luck, Abaddon had been weakened enough by transporting them to be an easy target for Eisheth. Whether Eisheth behaved herself in Sam’s body was another question.</p><p>“I’m going to make you suffer, Abaddon,” Eisheth said. “For at least 2,000 years.”</p><p>She flew at Abaddon, supernaturally propelled at an impossible speed. Bones crunched as they slammed against an oak tree. Abaddon was up in a flash, fiercely pounding Sam’s body with his fists.</p><p>“Careful with my brother,” Dean shouted from the sidelines.</p><p>Without looking up, Eisheth lifted Abaddon off his feet and threw him clear across the parking lot. He struck the metal dumpster outside the bar, crumpling its sides like an empty beer can.</p><p>The possibility that the fight would go on for hours was very real. Dean had no idea how powerful either creature was, but he knew the human bodies they wore would be destroyed long before the twisted souls within them. Alright, time to figure out an endgame.</p><p>As Abaddon lifted himself from the buckled dumpster, Dean made his move. He ran full-tilt toward the bar’s front door, swerving to avoid the scuffle. Abaddon landed a solid blow across Sam’s face just as Dean entered the bar.</p><p>“Phone. I—I need to use your phone.” Dean’s pale face and desperate tone were enough to convince the bartender to immediately grab the receiver from below the bar.</p><p>“It’s not long distance, is it?”</p><p>“Well, I’m calling Heaven...”</p><p>Thirty seconds later, Castiel picked up his cell phone. “Hello?”</p><p>“Cass. It’s Dean. I need your help. Right now.”</p><p>“Dean. Your absence has been... concerning me.”</p><p>“That’s great, man, I’m touched, but I need you to get your ass moving. Waubay, South Dakota. It’s the only bar in—“</p><p>Castiel appeared next to him. The bartender and his pack of regulars looked on in awe.</p><p>“—town.”</p><p>“Where’s Sam?” Castiel asked.</p><p>“Look outside,” Dean said. “I think we might need some backup.”</p><p>Within a minute, Cass had assembled a mixture of odds and ends he had found in the bar’s tiny kitchen. Herbs, a pile of toothpicks, and an assortment of other seemingly random ingredients that apparently formed a potent magical cocktail.</p><p>“You’re the MacGyver of magic, Cass.”</p><p>“I need blood,” Castiel said, as if he was asking Dean to pass him the salt.</p><p>“Whose?”</p><p>“Yours. That’s what will attract the angels. They’ll be looking for any sign of you.”</p><p>At that very moment something—or someone—was thrown against the side of the building, knocking knick-knacks off the walls. Dean took that as a sign. He grabbed a knife from behind the bar and opened a deep gash on his palm.</p><p>“A sigil,” Castiel said. “Quickly.”</p><p>Outside, Sam’s face was bloodied, his body bruised and beaten, and the fight was nowhere near over. Eisheth used Sam’s good left arm to smash Abaddon across the face, toppling him to the ground.</p><p>“I trusted you,” Eisheth said coldly. Sam’s fist pounded down against Abaddon’s cheek, sending blood spilling out of his mouth.</p><p>“You were never his favorite,” Abaddon hissed, barely able to move his lips. “You were no more than a pet. Why’d you think we put you—“</p><p>Eisheth punched him in the face again.</p><p>“—with the dog?” Abaddon cackled, blood pouring down his face and onto the dirt. A second later, his manic smile froze. He had seen something behind Sam that terrified him.</p><p>Eisheth turned and saw it as well. Five black specks dotted the otherwise clear sky. Within a heartbeat, they filled the heavens —five men, held aloft by invisible wings, fury in their eyes.</p><p>The angels descended on them in a flash, knocking Sam aside and plunging their heavenly daggers deep into Abaddon’s flesh. As he writhed in pain, Dean and Castiel rushed forward.</p><p>“Cass, get us out of here!” Dean cried as the angels turned from Abaddon to Sam.</p><p>Castiel and the closest angel were both speeding toward Sam. For Dean, time seemed to slow. If Cass didn’t reach him first, the angels would show Eisheth no mercy. Sam would die as collateral damage.</p><p>The next thing Dean knew, he was standing outside a greasy burger joint.</p><p>“What happened?” he asked, looking around.</p><p>Next to him, Sam stood, much the worse for wear, but alive. Castiel stood on his other side, having teleported them clear of the fight.</p><p>“Abaddon was destroyed. They’ll... Excuse me, but why is there a demon inside Sam?”</p><p>“It’s a long story, Cass.”</p><p>Castiel narrowed his eyes at Sam, studying him closely.</p><p>“Don’t. Don’t start anything. Just... let her go.”</p><p>Eisheth turned to Dean, surprised. “Let me go?”</p><p>“That was the deal. You save our asses, we save yours.”</p><p>“Dean, this is not just any demon,” Castiel said gravely.</p><p>“I know. And it could very well bite us in the ass. But that’s what’s happening.”</p><p>Five minutes later, they were sharing an odd farewell with Missy Fuller, former employee of Burger Junction, current bride of Satan.</p><p>It had been a strange few weeks.</p><p>Sam and Dean recounted their journey to Castiel over burgers. Sam noticed that Dean left out a lot of details, most of them concerning Julia.</p><p>That there had been a list of angelic vessels wasn’t news to Castiel. He’d heard rumors over the millennia that the list existed, but no one in Heaven had ever known its exact location.</p><p>“Except Abaddon,” Sam pointed out. He was still in considerable pain, despite Dean having patched him up and forced a cocktail of painkillers down his throat.</p><p>“His deception will have caught Heaven off guard. The angels are not going to blindly trust each other nearly as much as they once did.”</p><p>“So at least we’ve accomplished something,” Dean said with a touch of bitterness.</p><p>After eating their fill, Castiel helpfully teleported the Impala to the Burger Junction, then disappeared. He was off, once again, to try and find his absentee father. Sam and Dean both empathized.</p><p>As they climbed into the Impala, Dean frowned. “What do you think it’d be like? Having a home base like Walter and Julia did? Hunter HQ?”</p><p>“We’ve got Bobby. Besides, it didn’t work out very well for them.”</p><p>“I can’t shake this feeling... that our lives could have been different if they were still around. They were organized. They were everywhere.”</p><p>“Dad didn’t report in to anyone, and he got by just fine,” Sam said. “That’s what made him Dad.”</p><p>“What if they could have stopped Yellow Eyes. Saved Mom.”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He already felt the weight of the world on his shoulders. He didn’t particularly want to feel any more.</p><h2><span id="chapter-34">CHAPTER 34</span><a href="#chapter-34" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean’s footsteps creaked on the ancient wood floor of the Rustic Pines Retirement Community. It smelled like a hospital— every surface regularly wiped with disinfectant chemicals, stale processed air. Old people.</p><p>At the end of the hallway, a woman was waiting for him. She introduced herself as Betty, the resident coordinator. As they walked toward the East Wing of the building, she rattled off a list of facts that left Dean’s consciousness as soon as they entered. He really didn’t care about the bingo schedule. He was here for something else entirely.</p><p>They walked past a dozen rooms, all of them occupied. The faces inside looked friendly, content, which comforted Dean. Not a terrible place to grow old.</p><p>“The storage area is downstairs,” Betty said with a glued-on smile. “Excuse the conditions. We don’t usually bring guests down here.”</p><p>She wasn’t kidding. The basement was damp and unwelcoming, to say the least. Dean imagined he could feel the chill of the bare concrete through the soles of his shoes.</p><p>“Just through here,” she indicated.</p><p>A large door blocked their path. Its hinges were rusty and groaned loudly as she tugged on the metal handle. Inside, a sea of musty, ancient boxes greeted them. The remnants of entire lives, Dean thought. Like in the pyramids.</p><p>“I believe the articles you’re looking for are over here.”</p><p>With practiced swiftness, Betty navigated the maze of boxes and pulled out one in particular. The cardboard sagged at the bottom from the weight of its contents.</p><p>“Tell me again, what was your relation?”</p><p>Dean struggled with his answer. In the moment, with that box right in front of him, he couldn’t remember what he had told her on the phone. He took a stab in the dark.</p><p>“She was my great aunt.”</p><p>“She never talked about family. And no family ever visited.” That last sentence contained a jab directed squarely at Dean. An accusatory “Where were you?” was definitely implied.</p><p>“Yeah. Things were strained.”</p><p>“Better late than never, I guess. Although, for Julia, I guess not.” With that, Betty left Dean alone with the box.</p><p>He opened it delicately, almost afraid to touch the material inside.</p><p>Once Betty was definitely out of earshot, Dean whispered quietly, “I’m sorry you didn’t get your picket fence, Julia.”</p><p>Sam waited outside, leaning wearily against the Impala. Things are finally back to normal, he thought. More or less. Not that normal was good. In fact, Sam found himself missing 1954. For all of the tragedy, it had been nice to experience a time when things had been less complicated for a while. No Apocalypse. No horsemen. No impending battle to end all battles.</p><p>Dean walked slowly down the front steps of the retirement home, carrying a single piece of paper.</p><p>“You found her stuff?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Yeah. Let’s get moving.” Dean’s voice was gruff. Sam recognized his I-don’t-want-to talk-about-it face. Not that Sam ever let him get away with it...</p><p>“Dean, come on, what did you find?”</p><p>Dean stopped at the driver’s side door.</p><p>“Nothing worth yapping about.”</p><p>In one swift movement, Sam reached over the hood and snatched the piece of paper from Dean’s hand.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“We’re gonna talk about it eventually. I’m just skipping a six-hour car ride with you brooding the whole way.” Sam unfolded the paper, finding a list written in blocky handwriting. A guy wrote it, Sam realized. Specifically, Walter.</p><p>Sam held in his hands Walter’s transcribed list of bloodlines. At the very end, the words “Michael” and “Lucifer” were written on two consecutive lines. Next to each—nothing. The paper had been cut, Dean and Sam’s names removed from the list.</p><p>“She kept it,” Dean said after a while. “Don’t know what that says.”</p><p>“But she took our names off,” Sam said. “I think that says a lot.”</p><p>Dean opened his door and sat heavily in the driver’s seat. He exhaled loudly enough for Sam to hear it.</p><p>“You... You think you could drive?”</p><p>Those words were so seldom spoken that it took Sam a second to register them.</p><p>“Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yeah. I’ve been in the driver’s seat a little too much recently.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Sam rounded the front of the car and swapped seats with Dean.</p><p>“Where we heading?”</p><p>In the passenger seat, Dean had already closed his eyes.</p><p>“Surprise me.”</p><p>As night approached, the Impala motored onto the open road. Toward—for better or worse—their destiny.</p><p><strong>THE END</strong></p><h2><span id="author-s-note">AUTHOR’S NOTE</span><a href="#author-s-note" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>I was pleased to be asked by Christopher Cerasi to write a novel for Supernatural. Since the deadline conflicted with my impending wedding, I asked David Reed if he wanted to collaborate. I owe him great thanks for picking up the ball and running with it when I was crying over the cost of chair rentals. Also much thanks to Christopher for the support and fun phone calls; he has turned out to be a great friend and believer in the show. Thank you to Cath Trechman, who exhibited patience and professionalism throughout this process, and whose love for the written word shines through in her impeccable work. — Rebecca Dessertine</p><p>The authors would like to thank the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, and the exec producers for continuing the most gutsy, rockin’ show on TV.</p><p>Rebecca would like to thank her husband Jason, for his support and love, and her sister Carrie, without whom she wouldn’t understand how deep the love runs between siblings.</p><p>David would like to thank his wife Mairin, for almost never complaining about the insanely late nights that come with writing a novel while also holding a full time job. He’d also like to thank her for baking really great cookies, pretending to be excited about new Halo games, being an amazing mom, and a million more things that make her a great person to be around. In addition, David would also like to thank his son for being so gosh-darn cute.</p><h2><span id="about-the-authors">ABOUT THE AUTHORS</span><a href="#about-the-authors" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>DAVID REED grew up without cable TV, but still turned out all right. After completing nearly half of a computer science degree, he realized that programming computers is way less interesting than watching them turn evil and murder people on television. With that in mind, he set off with his then-girlfriend for Los Angeles, where he got his break working on Battlestar Galactica, subsequently writing the comic book miniseries Battlestar Galactica: Final Five with Seamus Kevin Fahey. Since then, he has branched out from robot mayhem to general mayhem, writing the Syfy Original Movie Lake Placid 3 and the story for the Supernatural episode “Hammer of the Gods.” He lives in Los Angeles with his wife and infant son.</p><p>REBECCA DESSERTINE wrote her first screenplay in fifth grade. She was very disappointed her sequel to Stand By Me was never optioned. After attending NYU at sixteen, she transferred to the University of Virginia, where she finished a degree in drama that turned out to be quite a waste of money after she moved to Los Angeles and discovered she wasn’t a good actress. She has worked for Supernatural for three years. As a writer she co-wrote the second series of the show’s comic Supernatural: Rising Son. She also co-wrote the story for the episode “Swap Meat.” Outside of the Supernatural realm she produced an independent film, Loveless in Los Angeles, that can occasionally be seen on Comedy Central. She currently lives in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Echo Park with her husband, dog, and two cats.</p><p>A</p>]]></content>

He stood at the edge of the pond, tearing small pieces from a slice of wheat bread and tossing them into the water. A half dozen ducks had gathered close to shore, and whenever a morsel landed close to them, they extended their necks, heads darting fast as striking snakes, and snatched up the snack in their rounded beaks. When the bread was gone, they stared at the humans, eager and alert for the next offering.</p><p>“Not all ducks fly south for the winter,” Joyce said. “As long as it doesn’t get cold enough to damage their feet, they can make it to spring just fine.”</p><p>Ted turned toward her, an amused smile on his face. “I thought you retired from teaching. Besides, you taught English, not biology.”</p><p>She couldn’t help laughing. “Once a know-it-all, always a know-it-all, I suppose.”</p><p>Even in his sixties, Ted Boykin was a good-looking man, with a full head of thick white hair, a trim goatee to match, and the most striking blue eyes. Back when he’d been principal at the school where Joyce had taught, he’d been clean-shaven, and while she was normally indifferent to facial hair on men, the beard gave him a roguish air that she liked. She’d worked alongside the man for more than twenty years, but while she’d respected him, even in some ways counted him as a friend, she hadn’t been attracted to him. But now here they were. Life sure was funny sometimes. In fact, it could be downright hysterical.</p><p>It was dusk in early November, and although it had been on the warm side throughout the day, now that the sun had dipped toward the horizon it was getting cold. Ted seemed comfortable in his brown jacket, but Joyce had donned a blue windbreaker before leaving her apartment, and it didn’t do much to ward off the chill in the air, especially since she wore only a T-shirt beneath. She wished she’d at least thought to grab a hat or scarf before walking out the door.</p><p><em>Why so addle-pated all of a sudden, my dear?</em> she asked herself. <em>Could it be that you were a wee bit nervous to rendezvous with Mr. Boykin down by the duck pond?</em> She wanted to tell herself that it was a ridiculous thought. She was a grown woman, for god’s sake! <em>Over</em>grown, truth be told, if not vertically then at least horizontally. And the pond was hardly lover’s lane. Even so, she had to admit to a certain uneasiness at being there. She’d been alone since her husband had died a few years back, and while she still missed him, in all that time she hadn’t felt the need to seek out a replacement. But then a week ago she’d bumped into Ted—almost literally. She’d been backing her Volvo out of the parking space in front of her apartment at the same moment Ted had been passing in front of her building. He’d barely managed to stop his Bronco in time to avoid ramming her rear end—<em>And isn’t that a phrase rife with naughty possibilities?</em>—and that’s when they’d discovered that after the deaths of their respective spouses, they’d both sold their homes and moved into Arbor Vale Apartments. In fact, Ted lived in the building next to Joyce’s, and had for almost two years, without either of them knowing the other was there. Small world, and all that.</p><p>The next day they’d met for lunch, and the day after that, dinner. They’d seen quite a bit of each other over the past seven days, and in that time, Ted had been a complete gentleman, not trying to kiss her or even hold her hand. She was, quite frankly, getting tired of it. She wished he would go ahead and make a move already. She was far from shy and would have made the first move herself if he hadn’t been so tentative toward her. The last thing she wanted to do was scare him off by being too direct: <em>Don’t you think it’s time the two of us had sex? It’s not like we’re getting any younger.</em> Somehow, she didn’t think that would work.</p><p>She brushed her black hair over her ear, even though there was no need. The air was still, and as short as she kept her hair, it rarely got mussed. Since childhood, she’d been something of a tomboy, and now that she no longer had to dress for work, that tendency had reasserted itself. She preferred simple clothes like T-shirts and jeans and wore no makeup. She’d recently taken to collecting jewelry that she picked up at auctions and estate sales, for reasons she couldn’t articulate clearly even to herself, but she rarely wore any of it. She wished she’d put some on today, though. Maybe if she seemed more feminine to Ted, he wouldn’t keep her at arm’s length. <em>Maybe he hasn’t gotten over the loss of his wife yet,</em> she thought. <em>Or maybe he still sees me as one of his teachers instead of a woman.</em> She was surprised by how much this latter possibility depressed her.</p><p>The pond lay behind Arbor Vale’s buildings, at the bottom of a gently sloping grassy hill. On the other side were woods of oak, elm, and ash trees, their leaves a splendorous mix of yellows, reds, and browns. Most of them hadn’t fallen yet, but Joyce knew it wouldn’t be much longer before they began drifting to the ground. A week, maybe two. Autumn was her favorite time of the year, partly because it was when school began, but mostly because of the energy that filled the crisp air. It was a delicious paradox that even as the world prepared for the temporary death brought by winter—to be followed by resurrection come spring—it seemed, at least to her, to be the most alive.</p><p><em>To hell with it,</em> she thought. <em>Life is for living.</em> She took a step closer to Ted, reached out, and took his hand.</p><p>She felt him tense and feared he would pull away, but then he relaxed and clasped her hand firmly. Joyce didn’t look at him, and he didn’t look at her, but they both smiled and gazed at the water. Ted tossed in the last of the bread, and once it was gone, the ducks milled about, hoping for more, but doomed to disappointment. Joyce admired the way the reflections of the trees on the opposite shore rippled on the water like shadowy ink.</p><p>She was wondering what the chances were of Ted kissing her later, and perhaps doing more than just kissing, when she heard a low growling sound. Fear jolted her, and she tightened her grip on Ted’s hand.</p><p>The ducks let out a series of alarmed quacks as they reared back, spread their wings, and one by one took to the sky, flapping with frantic urgency as they fled.</p><p>The sound came again, a deep rumbling like a truck engine in dire need of repair, only it was louder this time. And closer. The sound came from their right, and when Joyce and Ted turned in that direction, they saw a large dark shape emerge from the woods and come toward them, walking on all fours.</p><p>It moved with the slow, menacing deliberation of a predator, and at first Joyce thought it might be a coyote. In recent years, the animals had moved into Ohio, and while they were by no means common, there were more of them around than most people thought. Joyce had never seen one outside of TV and the zoo—not alive, anyway. The animals were masters of concealment that preferred to avoid humans whenever possible, and the only time she’d seen one was when it lay dead on the side of the highway after being struck by a vehicle. She had been surprised by how much larger it looked than she expected. Ohio coyotes had shaggier coats than their desert-dwelling cousins, which likely accounted for the seeming disparity in their sizes. But Joyce quickly discarded the possibility that this creature was a coyote. There was something wrong about it. The gloom of dusk cloaked it, rendering it a mobile shadow that moved with a lurching, uneven gait, as if it were injured. Its growls weren’t sounds of pain, though, but rather of hunger combined with almost human anger. Could it be a wolf? As far as Joyce knew, no wolves lived in Ohio, at least not in the wild. Maybe this one had been someone’s pet that had escaped or been turned loose for some reason. Yet its form lacked the feral grace of a wolf, and seemed more canine than lupine.</p><p>Then the smell hit her, a thick miasma of musk and rot that made her gorge rise.</p><p><em>Sweet Jesus, what</em> was <em>that thing?</em></p><p>“It’s okay,” Ted said. His voice was shaky, but he didn’t hesitate as he let go of Joyce’s hand and stepped between her and the approaching whatever-it-was. Normally, she would have hated having a man—any man—treat her as if she were some delicate thing that needed protecting, but something about this... this <em>creature</em> triggered a deep atavistic fear in her, and she was grateful for Ted’s gesture. She thought, too, that perhaps his actions were as much for his benefit as hers. As a former principal, he was used to being in charge and dealing with problems head on. It was his default setting, a comfortable role that he could fall back on in a time of crisis.</p><p>Still, as much as she appreciated what he was trying to do, her instincts told her it was a bad idea. <em>Very</em> bad.</p><p>She put her hand on his shoulder. “Please, don’t.”</p><p>Ted gave no sign that he heard her. Instead, he took a step toward the creature and drew himself up to his full height, arms held away from his sides, hands balled into fists.</p><p><em>He’s trying to make himself look larger,</em> Joyce realized. <em>More threatening.</em> She wondered if he’d done something similar in high school when dealing with potentially violent teenage boys. But hadn’t she read somewhere that directly facing a canine and making eye contact was a form of challenge to them? In that case—</p><p>The creature rushed forward, mismatched limbs moving with surprising speed, growl so loud it was nearly a roar. It moved so swiftly that in the dimming light of dusk Joyce could only make out the most basic details of its grotesque form: different-sized legs, a single ragged ear, bare skin alternating with patches of fur, and worst of all, a crooked muzzle filled with sharp teeth, far more than the mouth of a simple dog should have been able to hold.</p><p>When it was within a yard of Ted, the beast leaped into the air, discolored tongue lolling from the side of its misshapen mouth. Its front paws hit Ted on the chest, its weight driving him backward, slamming him against the ground. The impact drove the air from his lungs, and she heard a crack that she guessed was the sound of one or more ribs breaking.</p><p>Joyce had managed to sidestep in time to avoid being knocked down, and she now stood less than a foot away from Ted as he struggled with the freakish dog, which was roughly the size and bulk of a St. Bernard, although it didn’t resemble the breed otherwise. It snarled and snapped, intent on fastening its teeth around Ted’s throat, and Ted wrapped his hands around its neck in an attempt to hold it at bay. The dog-beast’s rear legs—one larger than the other—scrabbled at the ground as it fought to get close enough to sink its teeth into its prey. Ted grimaced, his arms trembling with the effort of trying to hold off the animal. Considering the massive size of the thing, it would have been too strong for most men to handle, and whatever physical strength Ted had possessed in his youth was long gone. He was relying on adrenaline and sheer force of will right now, but Joyce knew they wouldn’t be enough in the end. She feared he had only moments, if not seconds, before the monster dog overwhelmed him, fastened its jaws around his throat, and crushed his windpipe in a spray of blood.</p><p>Part of her—the primitive animal part that was only interested in self-preservation at all costs—wanted nothing more than to turn and run away as fast as her less-than-svelte legs were capable of carrying her. In fact, without fully being aware of it, she had already half-turned and taken a step away from the pond. But she forced herself to turn back. She would never forgive herself if she ran off and left Ted to die. She had to do something to help him, but what? She wasn’t about to try and grapple with the damned beast, and the closest thing to a weapon she had was her sometimes too-sharp tongue, which had filleted many a lazy student over the years. So, without anything else in her arsenal to rely on, she drew in a deep breath and, using what one of her fellow teachers had once referred to as “The Voice of Irresistible Authority,” she shouted a single word.</p><p>“Stop!”</p><p>The word sounded harsh as a whip crack on the chill autumn air, and it echoed across the pond. The dog-thing stopped snarling and turned to look at her, confusion and perhaps a touch of fear in its eyes. Joyce had the feeling that with that one word she had reached something deep inside the beast, an inner core which recognized that humans occupied a higher rung on the evolutionary ladder, and thus were its masters. The creature lowered its gaze and its tail—a hairless appendage that looked like it should have been attached to a giant rat—drooped between its legs. It let out a soft whine.</p><p>Ted, who’d been just as surprised as the dog by Joyce’s command, loosened his grip on the animal’s neck. Instantly, the grotesque canine’s upper lip curled away from its teeth, and the confusion in its eyes was replaced by blazing fury. The creature tore free from Ted’s grasp and lunged forward with a snarl.</p><p>Joyce screamed as the monster-dog sank its teeth into Ted’s throat and began shaking him back and forth, as if he were nothing but a toy. Ted’s eyes widened with fear and pain, but although his mouth gaped wide, no sound emerged. An instant later Joyce understood why, as thick blood geysered upward. It ran down the sides of Ted’s mouth and turned his white hair crimson before soaking into the ground beneath.</p><p>She opened her mouth to scream again, but the sound died in her throat. Something strange was happening. She thought at first that it was a trick of the waning light, but Ted’s pale pink skin was losing its color, becoming a dull slate gray. More than that, his skin was drawing in on itself, tightening against his bones, muscle and fat shrinking as he transformed into an unwrapped mummy before her eyes. Crazily, Joyce was reminded of one of the last trips she’d taken with her husband before the cancer spread to the point where he was unable to travel. They’d gone camping in Hocking Hills, and instead of sleeping bags, they’d taken a king-sized inflatable mattress with a battery-powered fan that inflated it within moments. The fan had a reverse switch on it that also deflated the mattress, so that when it was finished, it was completely flat, curled slightly at the edges and crisscrossed with wrinkly lines. That’s what Ted looked like now: a deflated gray air mattress with a skeleton inside.</p><p>The monster-dog held its grip on Ted’s throat a moment longer, and Joyce watched as the blood smeared on Ted’s face and the creature’s muzzle dried and flaked away. Like the monster had absorbed Ted’s life energy, drawn it into itself, and was determined not to let go of him until it had gotten every last bit. When it was finally finished, it withdrew its teeth from Ted’s desiccated flesh and turned its attention to her.</p><p>She heard someone whisper, “Run,” and it took her a moment to realize she was the whisperer. Hearing her own voice broke her paralysis, and she turned and ran.</p><p>The hill that led back up to the apartment complex wasn’t steep, but she was hardly in the best of shape. When she’d been younger, her idea of exercise had been a leisurely stroll in the park, and now most of her physical activity involved walking around antiques stores. Adrenaline could only do so much to compensate for a mostly sedentary lifestyle, and her heart pounded an uneven rhythm in her ears, and her lungs burned as if they were aflame. Her legs felt heavy and shaky, and they became more so with each step she took. Finally, something gave way in her right knee, her leg buckled, and she went down. She landed on her side and slid several feet down the hill before coming to a stop. She lay there, pulse thrumming, lungs heaving, knowing there was no way she could hope to escape the monster-dog now—if she’d ever had a chance in the first place. She closed her eyes and waited to feel the creature’s teeth sink into her throat.</p><p>But she felt nothing.</p><p>She opened her eyes and pushed herself to a sitting position. She turned to look back toward the pond, wondering what had happened. Had something scared the dog-thing off? Or had it simply been too full for another meal? For an instant she allowed herself to hope that she might survive this, but then she saw the creature. It sat next to Ted’s corpse, looking at her, head cocked to the side in a very doglike fashion. She understood at once what had happened, and the realization filled her with despair. The monster-dog hadn’t chased her because it hadn’t needed to. She was too slow, old, and overweight to get away. The creature had only needed to wait for her to bring herself down, and she had done so.</p><p>As she watched, the great misshapen beast came lurching toward her on its mismatched limbs, crooked mouth open, discolored tongue hanging out, eyes burning with horrible, inhuman hunger.</p><p>She screamed, but not for long.</p><h2><span id="chapter-2">CHAPTER 2</span><a href="#chapter-2" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I hate this damn car,” Dean said.</p><p>“You hate every car that’s not the Impala,” Sam countered.</p><p>“Yeah, well, this one’s especially sucktastic. And it smells like feet.”</p><p>They’d picked up the brown “crapmobile”—just one of Dean’s nicknames for it—behind a bar in Canton, Ohio. Dean would have preferred “borrowing” something with a bit more class, or at least something that didn’t drive like a turd with tires, but ever since they’d gone off the grid in order to avoid registering on the Leviathan’s radar, they’d been forced to keep a low profile, which meant no Impala. It also meant starting a sideline as reluctant car thieves—all for the greater good, of course. If the brothers failed to kill Dick Roman and ended up as human happy meals for him and his fellow monsters, the rest of the planet would be next on the menu. They were careful to take cars that no one would miss much, junkers that would be easy for their owners to replace and which the cops wouldn’t work too hard to find. Dean had his hands full keeping the rust heaps they stole running, but there was only so much he could do. He constantly kept his fingers crossed that they wouldn’t find themselves in a high-speed pursuit. As rough as the crapmobile was running, if he tromped on the gas, the rods would probably shoot out of the engine like friggin’ missiles.</p><p>“Here we are,” Sam said, pointing to a wooden sign on the side of the road. “Brennan, Ohio, which, according to the sign, is home to the Battling Brennan Brahman.”</p><p>Dean frowned as they drove across the town line. “Brahman? Aren’t they a kind of water buffalo or something?”</p><p>“Sort of. They’re a type of cattle named after the sacred cow of Hinduism.”</p><p>“Lousy choice for a school mascot, if you ask me. Alliteration only goes so far, you know?”</p><p>After they’d dropped in to the local sheriff’s department as a “courtesy” to let them know that two FBI agents were in town and to glean any additional information they could about the deaths, they drove through Brennan to get a feel for the place. Not that they really needed to. They might have gone from Northeast Ohio to Southwest, but for all the miles they’d driven, they might as well have stayed in the same place. After all the years he’d spent on the road, most Midwestern towns looked alike to Dean, and Brennan was no exception. A downtown consisting of small local businesses housed in old buildings, suburbs dotted with mini malls and chain restaurants, and a decaying industrial section, which in Brennan’s case was a closed bicycle factory on the south edge of town.</p><p>“You need a whole factory to make bikes?” Dean said. Sam just shrugged.</p><p>They found a cheap no-tell motel not far from the factory called the Wickline Inn, although Dean had no idea who or what a wickline was. They parked in front of the main office, and Sam went inside alone to register them. They always asked for a room as far from the main office as they could get, preferably one with empty rooms on either side. They’d been attacked in hotels more than once over the years, and the last thing they wanted to do was endanger any innocent lives.</p><p>Once Sam came out of the office with their room key, they pulled around to the back of the motel, parked, removed their stuff from the car—a couple backpacks with clothes and toiletries, Sam’s computer, and a couple duffle bags containing weapons—and entered the room.</p><p>Once they were inside, Dean wrinkled his nose. “Man, this place smells like mothballs and ass.”</p><p>“No argument there,” Sam said.</p><p>They put their stuff on the beds and gave the room a quick once over, checking the bathroom, looking under the beds, and testing the window locks. Only when they were satisfied the room was clear did they lock the door. Every hunter worth his or her rock salt-filled shotgun knew better than to cut off a possible exit until they were sure they didn’t need it. The brothers didn’t bother unpacking in case they needed to grab their gear and get the hell out of there in a hurry. Not for the first time, Dean thought how much his life resembled that of a criminal on the run. He’d never told Sam, but for a while now, whenever they settled into a hotel room, he thought of his time with Lisa and Ben, and how damned nice it had been to go to sleep and wake up in the same place day after day.</p><p>The room had a small desk by the window, and Sam set his laptop on it, raised the lid, and booted up the machine. When the screen came to life, he said, “Once again the Winchesters are open for business.” He sat down in front of the computer and started typing.</p><p>Dean sat down on the end of one of the beds, removed Bobby’s flask from the pocket of his brown leather jacket, unscrewed the lid, and took a drink. He didn’t take much, just a sip for maintenance. When he finished he replaced the lid, but instead of putting the flask away, he held it in his hands and looked at it for several moments. He remembered finding the bullet hole in Bobby’s cap, remembered turning around in the van and seeing the corresponding hole in Bobby’s forehead, remembered the blood...</p><p>“This is bull crap, Sammy.”</p><p>“What is?” Sam didn’t turn away from the computer screen. Once he got absorbed in the virtual world, he was harder to distract than a soul-starved demon intent on making a deal.</p><p><em>“This,”</em> Dean insisted, gesturing to take in the room. “Screwing around in Ohio when we should be nailing Dick Roman’s hide to the wall.”</p><p>Sam stopped typing and turned to look at his brother. “I know how you feel. I want to get Dick as much as you do.” He frowned. “Wait, that didn’t come out right.”</p><p>“Ha ha. That’s friggin’ hilarious. Quit fooling around, Sam. I’m serious.”</p><p>“So am I. Well, not about the dick joke. But I want to stop the Leviathan, too. Not only to keep them from turning the human race into quarter pounders, but because I want justice for Bobby. Just like you.”</p><p>Bobby Singer had been shot in the head by none other than Dick Roman himself during a scuffle with the Leviathan, and he’d died in a hospital not long after.</p><p>The Leviathan were among God’s first creations, predating humans and even angels, but the beasts proved too wild and uncontrollable, concerned only with sating their savage hunger, and God banished them to Purgatory. <em>Good work on that one, God,</em> Dean thought. Their friend and ally Cass—also known as the angel Castiel—had inadvertently released the Leviathan when he absorbed all the souls in Purgatory in order to gain the power to defeat the archangel Raphael. Once free of their ancient prison, the Leviathan began planning to take over the world, intending to keep humanity alive solely as a food source. Among other things, the creatures possessed the ability to analyze a human’s DNA and transform into an exact physical duplicate of their target. So the leader of the Leviathan assumed the guise of billionaire businessman Dick Roman, and used the man’s considerable financial and political assets to build a secret empire around the world.</p><p>The brothers knew that the Leviathan’s ultimate plan was the subjugation of humanity, but exactly how they intended to accomplish this—and how the Winchesters could stop them—they didn’t know. That lack of knowledge gnawed at them like rabid rats, especially in Dean’s case. Bobby had been more than an encyclopedic source of information, an endless fount of useful contacts, and a perpetually grouchy pain in the ass. He’d even been more than a close family friend. Bobby had been like an uncle to Dean and Sam. Hell, he’d practically been a second father to them, especially since their own dad had been on the road hunting and killing monsters much of the time while they were growing up. Both brothers missed him like hell.</p><p>There wasn’t anything in this life that Dean wanted more than to take down Dick Roman, and every second he and Sam spent doing anything other than bringing the pain to that shark-toothed son of a bitch was a second wasted as far as he was concerned. But they were here, so they might as well get to work.</p><p>He remembered something he’d been told recently. <em>Hunting’s the only clarity you’re gonna find in this life. And that makes you luckier than most.</em></p><p><em>Preach it, Brother Ness,</em> Dean thought. He could use a double-shot of clarity right now. Make that a triple. Besides, their detour to Brennan might not be a complete waste of time. <em>Who knows? There might even be a decent strip club in this town.</em></p><p>“All right.” He sighed and took another hit from Bobby’s flask. “Anything new since we left Canton?”</p><p>Sam looked at him a moment longer, and Dean thought his brother was going to say something about his drinking, but instead he turned back to face the laptop. He typed for a minute, stopped, then leaned forward and stared at the screen. Dean had seen him like this a thousand times before, and he knew what it meant.</p><p>“You got something.”</p><p>“Yeah. Looks like there’s been two more deaths, an older man and woman this time. According to the local paper—<em>The Brennan Broadsider</em>—they were found near a pond in back of the apartment complex where they lived. It happened two nights ago.”</p><p>Dean stood, slipped the flask back into his jacket pocket, and went to look at the screen over Sam’s shoulder.</p><p>“Does it say if they were getting their freak on when they died?”</p><p>Sam gave him a look.</p><p>“Hey, if you gotta go, you might as well go out smiling.”</p><p>Sam turned back to the screen. “They were mummified like the others. Literally nothing left but skin and bones.”</p><p>“We ganked Chronos, so we know he didn’t do it, but it sure sounds like his style.”</p><p>“Yeah, but the pattern’s different. Chronos killed in groups of three over a period of years. So far four people have died in Brennan, all in the last week.”</p><p>“And I assume they all ended up looking like they were on the diet plan from Hell.”</p><p>“Yep.” Sam continued reading. “The town officials are pretty spooked. They’re worried the deaths are the result of some kind of toxic chemical or exotic disease. They’ve even sent tissue samples from victims to the CDC.”</p><p>“Unless those guys have doctors who specialize in Weird with a capital W, I don’t think they’re going to find anything useful.”</p><p>Sam closed his laptop. “Looks like it’s up to us then.”</p><p>Dean gave his brother a wry smile. “Isn’t it always?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You sure we don’t need protective suits? You know, like the kind they wear in those movies about plagues and stuff?”</p><p>Sam regarded the kid from the rental office. He was in his early twenties, probably fresh out of college and working his first real job. He was medium height, thin, with neatly trimmed black hair and an angular goatee that made him look kind of douchey. He wore a semi-expensive tie and highly polished shoes—both looked brand new—along with a dark blue windbreaker. Back at Arbor Vale’s main office, he’d introduced himself as David Something—Stephenson maybe. Although Sam wasn’t sure. His brain wasn’t exactly firing on all cylinders these days, and every once in a while it slipped a gear. <em>Beats total insanity,</em> he thought.</p><p>After he and Dean had defeated Lucifer and prevented Armageddon, Sam’s body and soul had been separated. His body remained on Earth, while his soul was trapped in the pit with Lucifer and the archangel Michael. Sam’s body retained his memories, but without a soul he was the equivalent of a sociopath, devoid of all human feeling. In many ways, being soulless had made him a more efficient hunter. He was more decisive, quicker to act, and completely ruthless. Unfortunately, he also didn’t care if he caused any collateral damage during his hunts. If innocent people died while he was killing some monster, so what? It was simply the cost of doing business.</p><p>Meanwhile in Hell, Lucifer and Michael played with his soul like two bored cats sharing a single ball of string, and those cats had some damn wicked claws. They shredded his soul as if it were tissue paper, and when it was finally rejoined to Sam’s body—thanks to Death himself, no less—the damage done threatened to drive him insane. Death established a psychic wall to protect Sam from the madness that dwelt within him, but that wall had fallen, and it was now up to Sam to hold the insanity at bay on his own. Most days he did a good job hiding the crazy, but it took a lot out of him, and he wasn’t always certain he could trust his senses and memory.</p><p>So maybe the kid’s name was Stephenson, maybe not. At least he was sure the kid was real. Well... reasonably sure.</p><p>“Not in this situation,” Sam told Maybe-Stephenson. “We’re confident that the danger is minimal.”</p><p>“But there <em>is</em> danger,” the kid insisted. “Right?”</p><p>Sam and Dean were wearing their best “We’re government employees” monkey suits, and had introduced themselves as agents Smith and Jones. They’d flashed their faux FBI credentials at the kid and claimed they were there to assist the CDC in its investigation. He bought it, and now he was leading them, reluctantly, to the duck pond at the rear of the apartment complex.</p><p>Dean glanced sideways at him. “If there was any chance of contamination, don’t you think my partner and I would be wearing...” He trailed off and looked to Sam for help.</p><p>“Biohazard gear,” Sam supplied.</p><p>“Right,” Dean said. “That stuff.”</p><p>“Maybe,” the kid said, “but don’t you guys get special shots or something to inoculate you against deadly diseases, radiation, and other nasty crap? You know, A-level medicine, the kind of drugs the government pretends don’t exist.”</p><p>“Let me guess,” Dean said. “You spend a lot of time surfing conspiracy websites, don’t you?”</p><p>“Yeah. So?”</p><p>“Nothing. Just a hunch.” He gave Sam a look that said, <em>We got us a real genius here,</em> and Sam suppressed a smile.</p><p>Arbor Vale was an older complex, built sometime in the seventies, Sam guessed, but it was clean and the grounds were well maintained. It didn’t look like a place where supernatural evil lurked, but if his life as a hunter had taught him anything, it was that appearances meant jack. While monsters, demons, ghosts, and other nasties tended to be drawn to darkness and decay, they were just as likely to be found sniffing for prey in a well-to-do suburb as an abandoned graveyard. Evil—real Evil, the kind with a capital E—could be anywhere at any time.</p><p>The pond lay at the bottom of a gently sloping hill, and the Brennan PD had erected a crime-scene tape barrier at the top of the hill to warn anyone from getting too close. The tape was wound between a series of metal stakes driven through orange traffic cones, but despite the officers’ best efforts, the tape drooped low enough for them to step over.</p><p>“Seriously?” Dean said as he eyed the tape barrier. “Do the Deputy Dawgs in this town really think that’s going to keep anyone out?”</p><p>“I guess they don’t get many major crime scenes here,” Sam said.</p><p>The Winchesters stepped over without hesitation, but the kid hung back.</p><p>“Do you really need me to go down there with you?” he asked.</p><p>Dean gestured toward the pond. “You see those ducks swimming down there? Do you think they’d stick around if there was any toxic goo in the area?”</p><p>“Ducks could have a natural immunity to whatever it was that killed those two old people.” The kid’s eyes narrowed. “Or maybe whatever got them was genetically engineered to only be fatal to humans.”</p><p>“Man, you really need to lay off the Internet,” Dean said.</p><p>“Besides, I don’t want to go anywhere near those woods.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged a glance.</p><p>“Why not?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Feral dogs,” the kid explained. “Rumor is the woods around town are full of them. I haven’t seen any myself, but lots of people have. There’s one that’s supposed to be an especially scary bastard. Big and black.”</p><p>“A black dog.” Dean shot his brother another look. “You don’t say.”</p><p>“You can go back to the rental office,” Sam said. “If we need you for anything else, we’ll find you there.”</p><p>The kid reached into his shirt pocket, removed a business card, and handed it to Sam, who was gratified to see the last name on it was Stephens. Close enough.</p><p>“Tell you what, you need me, call me. Nothing personal, but I don’t want to catch anything from you guys. I don’t want to end up a human-sized prune, you know?”</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, Stephens turned and started back toward the rental office, almost but not quite running.</p><p>Sam stuck the card in his inner jacket pocket, and together he and Dean started down the hill toward the pond.</p><p>“Can you say paranoid?” Dean said.</p><p>“You can’t blame him. Something bad <em>did happen</em> here.”</p><p>“You think that bad had anything to do with the black dog Braveheart mentioned?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I don’t know. Could be.”</p><p>Sightings of spectral black dogs went back centuries—it was the legend Arthur Conan Doyle based <em>The Hound of the Baskervilles</em> on—but there was no definite answer to what the creatures were. Most hunters tended to believe one of two possibilities: either they were creatures of demonic origin or they were forms taken by shapeshifters. Sam didn’t see any reason why both explanations couldn’t be true. After all, the ecosystem of the supernatural world was just as varied in its own way as that of the natural one.</p><p>“Could be something living in the pond,” Sam continued.</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean allowed. “But if there is, the ducks don’t seem to be bothered by it.”</p><p>As they drew near the pond, they saw two smaller taped-off areas, one close to the water, one a bit farther uphill, both arranged in roughly rectangular patterns.</p><p>“Looks like the local PD believes in being thorough,” Dean said. “I’m surprised they didn’t put up a great big I’d Turn Back if I Were You! sign.”</p><p>“A musical reference?” Sam asked. “I would’ve expected something from <em>The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</em> or maybe <em>Porky’s II.”</em></p><p>“Just trying to broaden the repertoire.”</p><p>The brothers swept their gazes back and forth as they bantered, senses alive and alert. A big part of being a hunter was paying attention to your environment. Sights, sounds, and smells could all provide clues to the presence of a supernatural manifestation, but the most important sense of all was one that didn’t have a name. It wasn’t psychic, exactly. More like heightened instinct. Hunt long enough, <em>survive</em> long enough, and you developed the ability to know when something wasn’t right. It was a subconscious process, not a cognitive one, but both Sam and Dean had learned long ago to trust it, and right now that sense was telling Sam that whatever had happened here to cause the deaths of two people, it hadn’t been natural.</p><p>They reached the tape rectangle on the hillside first. Sam removed his EMF detector from his outer jacket pocket, turned it on, and held it close to the ground. The electromagnetic readings in the area were normal, and he switched the machine off and placed it back in his pocket.</p><p>“So we know that whatever did this wasn’t a ghost,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s been two days since the deaths,” Sam pointed out. “Any electromagnetic energy left behind might’ve faded in that time.”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>Both brothers squatted to get a closer look at the ground. They didn’t break the tape, though. They preferred not to disturb crime scenes any more than necessary, just in case it turned out that an ordinary human scumbag was responsible instead of a thing that went bump in the night.</p><p>“According to the <em>Broadsider,</em> this is where the woman’s body was found.” Sam pulled a small notebook out of his shirt pocket and opened it to the most recent entry. “Her name was Joyce Nagrosky, and she was a retired high school English teacher. The other victim was Ted Boykin. He was retired, too. Used to be the principal at the school where Joyce taught.”</p><p>“Think they came down here for a little extracurricular workout?” Dean asked. “Just ‘cause they were enjoying their golden years doesn’t mean they couldn’t enjoy each other, too. I mean, the guy’s last name <em>was</em> Boykin. <em>Boink-ing.</em> Get it?”</p><p>Sam just looked at him.</p><p>“I thought it was funny,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Despite his brother’s lousy joke, Sam knew there was a serious question behind it. Supernatural creatures preyed on humans for a variety of reasons, but the most common one was to feed. Some, like the Leviathan, fed on humans literally. Vampires drank human blood. Some ate only certain parts of the body, like kitsune, which fed on the pituitary gland.</p><p>Amy’s face flashed through his mind, and for a moment he thought he heard her voice whispering in his ear. <em>All the coolest people are freaks...</em> He shoved the memory of her aside, along with the pang of guilt that came with it. He had work to do.</p><p>Some monsters drained life energy. Some, such as succubi and incubi, fed on sexual energy. If Joyce and Ted had been doing the wild thing by the pond, they might have attracted the attention of something even wilder.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Sam said after a moment’s consideration. “They may have been a couple—the paper didn’t say anything about that—but this area’s a little too close to the apartment complex for them to have any privacy.”</p><p>“Maybe they were into the whole thrill-seeking thing,” Dean countered, but without much conviction. “I don’t smell anything weird. No scent of sulfur, rotting fish, or decayed flowers.” He sniffed. “No demon dog stink, either.”</p><p>“The area’s not cold,” Sam said. “Well, not any colder than normal for this time of year.”</p><p>“The ground’s pretty well torn up,” Dean said. “The locals could’ve done it. Like you said earlier, they’re probably not used to handling a real crime scene.”</p><p>“Could be,” Sam allowed. “But a dog could’ve done it, too.”</p><p>“Size of these marks, it would’ve been a big one.”</p><p>“Yep. No blood, though. An animal that big, if it attacked someone, it would’ve made a mess.”</p><p>Dean pressed his index finger to the ground and pushed the tip into the dirt. “Hasn’t rained recently. So if there had been any blood, it wouldn’t have been washed away.”</p><p>The brothers stood, and Dean wiped his fingertip off on his pants leg.</p><p>“Let’s go check out where they found the principal,” Sam said.</p><p>The brothers walked down to the edge of the pond and examined the second cordoned-off area. There was less grass there, and the ground was softer. There were obvious prints, mostly from the police and paramedics, probably, but there were also a number of what appeared to be claw marks in the ground, along with a single clear paw print. A damn big one.</p><p>The brothers stood thinking for a moment, the ducks on the pond keeping their distance and eyeing them warily.</p><p>After a bit, Dean said, “Here’s how I think it played out. Ted and Joyce walk down to the pond. Maybe they’re taking a stroll, feeding the ducks, thinking about getting busy later, whatever. Then our killer dog approaches from over there.” He pointed to the woods. “It attacks them and Ted, being the stand-up guy he is, tries to slow it down long enough so Joyce can get away. She runs, but Cujo makes quick work of old Ted, chases after her, and that’s all she wrote.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “That’s how I see it, too. But how exactly did it kill them? The paper didn’t say anything about their bodies being ravaged by an animal.”</p><p>“Yeah, I know. They were mummified. Hey, you don’t suppose they were just really, <em>really</em> old?”</p><p>“I think we need to take a look at those bodies.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>As Sam and Dean headed back up the hill, neither of them noticed a shadowy figure step out from between the trees at the edge of the pond and watch them depart.</p><h2><span id="chapter-3">CHAPTER 3</span><a href="#chapter-3" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A couple hours later, Sam and Dean returned to the pond. They’d ditched their monkey suits for their normal street clothes, something for which Dean was profoundly grateful. He wore his leather jacket, Sam wore his blue coat, and both of them had hoodies and flannel shirts underneath. Even when it was cold outside, the brothers rarely wore anything heavier. Thick clothes could slow you down, and a slow hunter was all too often a dead hunter. Layers were the way to go. You could strip them off as needed, and ditching your outer jacket was a good way to quickly change your appearance in case someone—like the cops—was looking for you.</p><p>Dean never felt comfortable in a suit, with the possible exception of his 1940s threads, although he had to admit they had their uses. Not only did they make it easier to get cops to talk to you, they worked magic on hospital employees. They had no problem getting the morgue attendant to grant them access to the bodies of Joyce Nagrosky and Ted Boykin. Better yet, since the county’s medical examiner suspected some sort of contagion was at work in their deaths, he hadn’t conducted full autopsies. He was waiting for the CDC to report on the tissue samples he’d sent, which meant that Sam and Dean had a pair of pristine bodies to check out. Sometimes the key detail in a supernatural death was subtle, and a doctor might destroy an important piece of evidence without meaning to. But they hadn’t had to worry about that this time.</p><p>Both bodies had been the same. They reminded Dean of the empty husks that cicadas left behind when they changed into their adult forms. <em>Damn creepy things, those bugs!</em> According to the ME’s preliminary findings, the bodies still possessed all their internal organs, but it was as if every drop of moisture had been drained out of them. Not just blood, either. All fluid was gone—water, spinal fluid, gastric juices, you name it—leaving Joyce and Ted looking like skeletons covered in thin gray parchment paper. <em>Corpse-a-gami,</em> Dean thought. The bodies shared one other salient feature: vicious gashes on the throat. The ME postulated that the injuries had been delivered post mortem by some sort of scavenger. But the way he and Sam figured it, the wounds had been caused by the monster dog, which Dean had consequently taken to calling Dogula.</p><p>Their examination of Joyce and Ted’s bodies hadn’t provided any clues as to the nature of the creature that had killed them, and a follow-up Internet search hadn’t yielded anything of use, so the brothers had brought a variety of weapons with them. Pistols loaded with silver bullets, a Winchester 1887 shotgun filled with rock salt—which Dean carried—a knife of cold iron dipped in holy water, and a demon-killing blade. Like the Boy Scouts, hunters believed in being prepared. Or, as Bobby used to put it, <em>Better to haul some extra hardware than to end up as little chunks of undigested meat in a pile of monster scat.</em></p><p>“This isn’t right, Sam. I know something’s not kosher in this town, and I know I agreed to look into it, but I can’t help feeling that we’re dishonoring Bobby’s memory by putting off going after Roman. And don’t tell me that we have a responsibility to help the good people of Brennan. The world is filled with monsters, and no matter what we do, we’ll never get them all. There are just too damn many of them, and there are only two of us. We have to take care of family business first, and that’s what Dick Roman is—not to mention that he and his army of pet piranhas are a threat to the whole freakin’ world!”</p><p>They’d continued walking the entire time Dean spoke, and had reached the edge of the woods. They stopped and Sam turned to face his brother.</p><p>“You think Bobby would want us to walk away from this case?” he asked. Then added, “Or any case, for that matter?”</p><p>“No,” Dean said, “but that doesn’t mean—“</p><p>“Before you go any further, hear me out. After our run-in with Chronos, I started thinking.”</p><p>“Started?” Dean snorted. “Do you ever stop?”</p><p>Sam ignored him and went on. “The magic Chronos used to travel through time was pretty powerful stuff. Makes sense, because he was a god, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. So?”</p><p>“So even though the bodies we saw today didn’t look exactly like Chronos’ victims, there were some striking similarities.”</p><p>Dean frowned. “You think we might be dealing with another god here?”</p><p>“Too early to tell. But like I said, our run-in with Chronos got me thinking. If we’re going to have any hope of ganking Dick Roman and stopping the Leviathan, we’re going to need some serious firepower. A case like this, where big-time mojo is involved...”</p><p>“Wait a minute. Are you saying that you want to capture the monster, spirit, god, or whatever it is and use it as a weapon against the Leviathan?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “Whatever the Leviathan are exactly, we know they were the first beings God created. That means they’re alive, right? If that’s the case—“</p><p>“Then they could be killed by draining their life force.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “Possibly. So if we can learn how Joyce and Ted were killed, along with the two others who died before them, maybe we’ll be able to find some way to use it against the Leviathan.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that’s a good idea, Sammy. Fighting fire with fire hasn’t always worked out so well for us. Two words: demon blood.”</p><p>Sam lowered his gaze to the ground, but otherwise didn’t reply.</p><p>Despite his misgivings, Dean could feel his excitement building. He surely wouldn’t mind having the supernatural equivalent of a backpack nuke to shove down Dick Roman’s slimy throat. There was also a certain symmetry to the idea that he liked, and which he thought Bobby would appreciate. The Leviathan—creatures that lived solely to feed—would be destroyed by a power that devoured their life energy.</p><p>“So you’re saying this case isn’t so much about ganking some random monster as it is about, what? Research and development?”</p><p>“Something like that. And if we get to kill a monster in the bargain, so much the better.”</p><p>Dean thought about it for a moment. “Okay, I’m in. Let’s go find Dogula.”</p><p>The brothers entered the woods. Oak, elm, and ash trees predominated, and the ground held only a scattering of leaves. Good. They’d make less noise that way. The last thing they needed to be doing was crunching leaves underfoot and giving away their position when there might be a life force-sucking monster running around. Dean found himself wishing that it had rained recently. The ground was too hard for there to be any tracks, and while the underbrush showed signs of something having passed through recently, Ohio had a deer overpopulation problem, and there was no way to tell if it was Dogula or a herd of Bambis. Joyce and Ted had died two days before, and there was a chance that the monster responsible had moved on, but Dean doubted it. The things he and Sam hunted tended to stick to one location, more often than not, whether because their particular species was territorial or because they were mystically bound to a specific area.</p><p>Dean spoke in a soft, low voice. “So how did you miss the reports of a black dog running around town? You losing your research-fu?”</p><p>“I guess no one made the connection between the black dog and the deaths. No reason why they should.”</p><p>“Yeah. Sometimes I forget Joe and Jane Normal don’t know all this stuff exists.”</p><p>That was one of the reasons Dean enjoyed horror movies so much. Sure, they were hilarious because of how screwed up their lore was, not to mention how many insanely dumb decisions the characters made. But also, when he watched them, he could imagine what it was like to be an ordinary person, enjoying horror flicks for nothing more than a fun scare, knowing all the time he was safe because ghoulies, ghosties, and long-leggedy beasties were only make believe.</p><p>The sound of a branch snapping broke the silence like a gunshot, and the brothers froze. Dean’s senses, honed from hundreds of battles, screamed at him that they were about to be under attack, and he knew better than to question them. He shoved Sam to the side and dove in the opposite direction an instant before a large black form hurtled through the space where they had been standing. The brothers hit the ground, rolled, and came up on their feet in time to see the creature spin around to face them, jagged teeth bared in a snarl. Even by monster standards, the thing was one ugly son of a bitch. Its body was twisted, its features distorted, and none of its legs matched in length. It had patches of bare skin, as if it suffered from mange, but now that Dean got a good look at it, he saw that its fur wasn’t black—at least, not entirely. It <em>was</em> black in places, but it was also brown and gray, and its different-colored fur had different consistencies, longer and thicker here, shorter and thinner there. The creature’s sections were separated by thin lines of red scar tissue, as if it weren’t a single beast but rather a conglomeration of different canines.</p><p>“That’s thing’s not Dogula,” Dean said, “it’s Frankenmutt!”</p><p>He dropped the shotgun to the ground. Rock salt wouldn’t be worth a damn against something corporeal. He drew his trusty Colt .45, aimed at the spot between Frankenmutt’s eyes, and squeezed off a round. Sam had drawn his Beretta at the same time and he fired as well, aiming for the same target.</p><p>Frankenmutt was roughly the size of a St. Bernard, and ungainly as the creature looked, Dean expected it would move with all the speed and grace of an iron anvil. He was confident their bullets would hit the beast. But instead of Frankenmutt’s brains exploding out the back of its head to decorate the tree behind it, the monstrous canine became a dark blur and a split second later it crouched three feet to the right of its previous position. Bullets ripped chunks of bark from the tree, but Frankenmutt was unharmed. A good result if he and Sam were looking to start new careers as unorthodox lumberjacks, but not so good if they wanted to actually kill the goddamned monster.</p><p>Frankenmutt lowered its head and glared at them with mismatched, rheumy eyes. It growled deep in its throat, a strange sound, with separate pitches overlapping, almost as if two dogs were growling instead of one. Dean kept his gaze focused on its eyes. You could always tell when a human opponent was going to make a move by watching their eyes, and this was also true for most supernatural creatures. Those that had eyes, anyway. Unfortunately, Frankenmutt’s were different sizes and colors, and they worked independently of each other, like a lizard’s. Not only was it freaky as hell, it made it impossible to guess the creatures intentions.</p><p>Dean was caught off guard when Frankenmutt started running toward them, moving with a weird lurching stride that was surprisingly fast. He managed to get off another round from his .45, but the bullet went wild and struck the ground near the dog’s right paw. The near miss only pissed it off, and it swerved toward Dean, leaping for him, jaws wide and flecked with foam, discolored tongue lolling from the side of its mouth. Dean dropped his .45 and raised his hands in time to grab hold of the dog’s throat as it slammed into him. He maintained his grip as the creature’s weight bore him to the ground. The underbrush softened his landing somewhat, but the jolt still knocked the wind out of him. Frankenmutt snarled with savage rage, jaws snapping as it tried to sink its teeth into Dean’s throat. He managed to hold the creature at bay, but it wasn’t easy. The damned thing was a hell of a lot stronger than it looked. Its teeth were only inches from the soft flesh of his neck, and they were edging closer with each second. If the beast bit him, it would start draining his life force, and once the process began, Dean didn’t know how long it would take. Maybe minutes, maybe only seconds. Dean wondered what he’d look like if he got prune-ified, and the resultant mental image wasn’t pretty.</p><p>Sam stepped forward, assumed a shooting stance, leveled his Beretta, and fired three bullets into Frankenmutt’s side in quick succession. Dean felt the creature jerk with the impact of each round, and blood issued from the wounds. Not red, though. This stuff was black, thick, and slow-moving, more like syrup. The black goo made him think of the gunk that poured out of Leviathan when they were wounded, but this ichor was darker and it stank like rotten meat. Despite its injuries, Frankenmutt didn’t appear to be in any pain. If anything, it seemed more enraged. It tore free of Dean’s grip, jumped off him, and lurched toward Sam, growling and snapping.</p><p>Sam held his ground and fired twice more as the monstrous canine bore down on him. The bullets took out hunks of flesh and made more ichor flow, but the creature barely slowed as it lunged toward him. It fastened its teeth on Sam’s right leg just above the ankle, and Sam let out a cry of pain and fired point blank at Frankenmutt’s head. Part of the dog’s skull was sheared away, taking an ear with it. The beast let go of Sam, staggered backward, and then shook its head back and forth rapidly, as if its head was wet and it was trying to dry itself. Blood and bits of brain matter flew through the air, and then the creature turned and ran off into the woods, swerving as it went, almost as if it were drunk.</p><p>Sam sat on the ground and took in a hissing breath. He placed his Beretta next to him, and gingerly began to inspect his wound. Dean got up, retrieved his .45, and walked over to Sam, scanning the area for any sign that Frankenmutt was planning to double back and renew its attack.</p><p>“How bad is it?”</p><p>“I’ll live.” Sam’s sock was wet with blood, and when he peeled it away from the skin, a ragged wound was revealed. “It’s not too deep. I think most of the damage was caused when I shot him in the head. The impact caused him to jerk away from my ankle, and his teeth tore the skin.”</p><p>“All right. Let’s tape you up and get you back to the car.” Dean knelt next to his brother, reached into one of his jacket’s outer pockets, and pulled out a roll of silvery duct tape. Their first aid kit was in the crapmobile, but duct tape would make an effective field dressing until they reached the car.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Sam insisted. “We have to go after the dog.”</p><p>He tried to stand, but when he put his weight on his wounded ankle, it buckled, and he sat back down, grimacing with pain.</p><p>“Frankenmutt can wait until after we’ve plugged your leak,” Dean said. “Now shut up and sit still.” He ripped off a length of tape and went to work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean’s field dressing was good enough to allow Sam to make it back to the motel. Once there, he went into the bathroom, carefully cut the tape away with a pair of surgical scissors, and threw the blood-smeared mess into the trash. He then cleaned the wound—first with holy water, then with soap and regular water, and finally with alcohol. Afterward, he lathered on some antibiotic cream, then bandaged and wrapped it. Satisfied, he dry swallowed a couple ibuprofen before limping out of the bathroom. The injury was going to slow him down, but not as much as he’d feared.</p><p>Dean had tossed his jacket on his bed, and he sat at the table in his hoodie, leaning back in the chair, feet up, staring at the laptop screen.</p><p>Sam smiled. “I hope you’re not checking out one of those sites where you have to click ‘I verify that I’m eighteen years or older’ for access.”</p><p>He regretted it as soon as he said it. Considering how obsessed Dean had been with Dick Roman in the past few weeks, Sam would have far preferred his brother to visit a few sleazy websites than try to dig up still more information on their least favorite Leviathan.</p><p>“I’ve been surfing the web looking for the skinny on butt-ugly patchwork dogs.” When Sam didn’t reply right away, Dean added, “What? Like you’re the only one who knows his way around a mouse pad?”</p><p>“Skinny?” Sam said.</p><p>“Yeah, well... guess I picked up some new vocabulary in 1944.” He took his feet off the table, sat up, and faced Sam. “Speaking of picking things up, we should probably get you to a doctor before you come down with Franken-rabies.”</p><p>“You’re joking, right? Supernatural creatures don’t carry natural diseases.”</p><p>“Still, better safe than hydrophobic, right? All it’ll take is a series of incredibly painful abdominal injections.” Dean grinned.</p><p>“That’s not how they treat rabies. You get a shot of vaccine in the shoulder, then gamma globulin in the wound and in the hips or the butt. They’re no more painful than normal shots. But it doesn’t matter because I don’t need them.”</p><p>Dean sighed. “What’s the point of being the older brother if you can’t torture the younger one every once in a while? Besides, who says Frankenmutt is supernatural? You saw those scar lines, right? He looked like something a mad scientist slapped together from spare parts.”</p><p><em>“Frankenstein</em> was just a novel by Mary Shelley,” Sam said. “You ever read it?”</p><p>“I’ve seen all the movies,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam ignored him and went on. “Shelley wrote her novel in the early 1800s, long before the modern era of science. The procedure she wrote about is pure fiction. It could never work in the real world. You can’t make a single body out of a bunch of separate parts. Forget about trying to hook up the central nervous system, the problems with tissue rejection alone...” Sam trailed off when he realized Dean was staring at him. “What?”</p><p>“I thought you went to law school, not medical school.”</p><p>“My point is that whatever Frankenmutt is, it’s not a product of science.”</p><p>“All right, I’ll take your word for it, Dr. Dorkwad.”</p><p>Sam had been standing as they talked, and his ankle was starting to throb. He also felt suddenly tired. Maybe he’d lost more blood than he thought. He hobbled over to one of the beds and sat down. Dean watched him closely as he walked, and although he frowned, he said nothing about Sam’s injury, and Sam was grateful.</p><p>“Did you find anything on the Net?” he asked.</p><p>“Other than stuff about the movie <em>Frankenweenie,</em> no.” He closed the laptop and sat back in the chair. “Man, I can’t get over how fast that thing was. The way it looked, it should’ve had trouble just walking, but it moved faster than a cheetah on meth.”</p><p>“Not at the end,” Sam pointed out. “After I shot it in the head, it took off, but it didn’t move much faster than an ordinary dog. And it moved in a zigzaggy kind of way, like it was having trouble staying on its feet.”</p><p>“That’s because you wounded it. If you were missing half your head, you wouldn’t be moving very fast either.”</p><p>“It shouldn’t have been moving at all, but the injury only slowed it down, and I think I know why.”</p><p>“Let me guess. It was full of life energy after killing Joyce and Ted, which is why it could move so damn fast, but its needle dropped to E after you shot it, and it had just enough left in the tank to make a getaway.”</p><p>“That’s my take on it,” Sam said. A wave of weariness came over him, and he stifled a yawn. What was wrong with him? It wasn’t even five o’clock yet, and he felt ready to hit the sack.</p><p>“It’ll do till a better theory comes along. So whatever this thing is, it’s still just your basic supernatural freak show, only with more emphasis on the freak this time. How do you figure all those dog parts came together, though? Maybe we should check the town for a pet cemetery. Or it could be some kind of group ghost, a whole pack of doggie spirits, and I should’ve blasted it with rock salt after all.”</p><p>Sam fought another yawn. “It still could be a Frankenmutt, only one created by magic instead of science. I’ll see what I can dig up about spells that are supposed to... fuse body parts... together.” This time he couldn’t fight the yawn, and he fell back onto the bed without bothering to get under the covers. “After I take a nap.”</p><p>“Hey, Sam, are you o–”</p><p>That’s the last he heard before a warm, wonderful darkness gathered him up and swept him away.</p><p>* * *</p><p>In the parking lot outside the Winchesters’ room, a figure stood. There was no one around, but even if there had been, they wouldn’t have seen him. Not unless he wished it. A gentle breeze was blowing, but even though it caressed his skin, he didn’t feel it.</p><p>Even from here, he could sense the injury that had been done to Sam Winchester, both the physical component and the spiritual. Of the two, the latter was far more serious.</p><p><em>This isn’t good,</em> he thought. <em>Not good at all.</em> But all he could do was stand here and continue to watch.</p><p>For the moment, at least.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Catherine Luss tossed the <em>Broadsider</em> onto the kitchen counter. It was yesterday’s edition, but she’d been so busy working that she’d had no chance to look at it before. The headline screamed off the front page in large black letters:</p><p><strong>TWO MORE FOUND DEAD IN</strong></p><p><strong>MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES!</strong></p><p>She’d only gotten partway through the lead story before she hadn’t been able to read any further. She hadn’t known either Ted Boykin or Joyce Nagrosky. Both had retired before Bekah started high school, and neither had been among her patients. She also hadn’t known the two previous victims—a gas station attendant named Randy Neff and a teenage girl named Angela Bales. She thought Bekah might’ve known Angela, or at least been aware of her, as they’d been close in age, but she didn’t know, and it wasn’t as if she could ask her daughter. Not anymore.</p><p>She’d poured herself a cup of coffee with half-and-half and artificial sweetener before sitting down at the counter for what she’d hoped would be a relaxing—and badly needed—break from work. The time readout on the microwave said it was 5:12, but until she’d looked out the window, she hadn’t known whether that was a.m. or p.m. She wondered how long she’d been down in the lab this time, and was surprised to discover she didn’t know. Twenty-four hours? Forty-eight? Did it even matter?</p><p>What did matter was that headline, or rather the four lost lives behind it. The story was short on facts and long on hysteria-fueled supposition, speculating that the deaths were caused by anything from a previously unknown super bug to toxic waste or radiation—despite the fact that Brennan had no industry that could have produced either of the latter. She was surprised the reporter hadn’t blamed the deaths on UFOs while he’d been at it. But she knew exactly who was ultimately responsible for those poor people’s deaths.</p><p>She was.</p><p>The temperature in the kitchen seemed to drop several degrees. Catherine was wearing a white lab coat over a gray pullover sweater with a thick collar, but she still shivered. She felt the cold as much inside as out.</p><p>“It’s not your fault.”</p><p>The voice was soft, little more than a whisper, really, with a slight accent that she thought might be German, although she wasn’t sure. A subtle odor drifted to her on the air, a musty smell like a just-opened cedar chest that had been closed for a very long time. She took a sip of her coffee and half turned on the stool to face Conrad.</p><p>Even though she’d been working with him for the past few months, she still had to struggle to keep an expression of distaste from showing every time she looked at him. It wasn’t that he was hideous. He was rather pleasant-looking, actually, if on the plain side. A thin man in his early sixties, he stood no more than five-foot-five and had a large nose contrasted by small, almost feminine lips and a narrow chin. His hairline had receded well past his forehead, but the hair that remained to him was brown and thick, without a hint of gray. His most striking feature, however, was his large penetrating eyes. They rested beneath thick black eyebrows, and their color was indeterminate, seeming to change depending on the light. Sometimes they were dark blue, sometimes charcoal gray, and other times almost black. As always, he wore a suit, this one brown with an ivory shirt and gold tie—stylish and retro at the same time. It wasn’t his appearance that Catherine found distasteful, nor was it the way he tended to remain statue-still until he decided to move. What bothered her was something more indefinable, his... presence, she supposed you could call it. He exuded an aura that she found repellent in the same way that magnets of opposite charge pushed against each other. Whenever he approached, she felt an urge to back away, to keep as much distance between them as possible. He did nothing overt to intimidate her, but she had to fight to hold her ground whenever they were in the same room together—which these days they often were.</p><p>She ran her hand through her short blonde hair, suddenly aware of how greasy it was. She was in dire need of a shower. She hated to think what she smelled like, and she probably had the world’s worst case of dragon breath from all the coffee she’d been drinking. Working alongside Conrad down in the lab, she never thought about such things. If she did stink, he never gave any sign that he noticed, let alone was bothered by, her body odor. But up here, in what she thought of as the Real World, she was painfully aware of her lack of hygiene.</p><p>“Tell that to the families of the four people who died,” she responded. “I took an oath, Conrad.”</p><p><em>“Primum non nocere:</em> First, do no harm,” Conrad said. “I am familiar with the Hippocratic Oath.” He gave her a slight, almost amused smile, but otherwise stood completely still, his hands at his sides. From the neck down, he might as well have been a mannequin.</p><p>“It’s my fault it escaped,” she said.</p><p><em>“Our</em> fault,” he corrected. “We both thought the cage you had me purchase would be of sufficient strength to contain the beast. I am only grateful that you were at your practice when it made its bid for freedom. Otherwise, it surely would have attempted to feed on you.”</p><p>What a mess the damned thing had made in its escape, too. The damage to the lab hadn’t been so bad, since the creature headed straight for the stairs after tearing free from its cage, but it knocked down the basement door and raced around the house as it searched for a way out—shredding her furniture with tooth and claw in frustrated rage—before finally crashing through the back door. Luckily, it had happened in the early evening and had been dark enough by then that none of her neighbors had seen the beast as it fled. It also helped that she lived on several acres of land outside town. If she’d lived in a suburb, somebody surely would have spotted the monstrous dog running from her house and called the police. In that case, she’d probably be in jail right now, her medical license suspended. If she’d lived in an earlier age, she’d likely have been burned at the stake. She still could be, she supposed. The people of Brennan weren’t exactly the most educated or progressive in the state.</p><p>Even though she found being in Conrad’s presence difficult, Catherine was thankful for his assistance. He’d taken care of everything, buying and installing two new doors, as well as removing the worst of the damaged furniture and hauling it away. He’d even offered to replace her lost furniture, but she’d declined. She spent most of her time down in the lab, and it wasn’t as if anyone else lived in the house. Not anymore.</p><p>She held her mug in both hands and looked down at the coffee within. “Maybe it would’ve been better if I had been here,” she said softly.</p><p>Conrad stepped forward. For a moment she feared he meant to reach out and touch her, perhaps give her upper arm a reassuring squeeze or lay a comforting hand on her shoulder. She tensed, hoping that if he did she would be able to keep from screaming. As if sensing her discomfort, Conrad took a step back and kept his hands at his sides.</p><p>“You shouldn’t speak like that,” he admonished mildly. “The beast’s escape and the lives subsequently lost are regrettable, yes, but I must remind you of the larger concern here. If you achieve your goal, not only shall you reap personal reward, you will change the world forever. Untold billions of lives will be saved, and the human lifespan itself will be extended. It is impossible to say just how long people will live in the new world your work will bring about, but virtual immortality is not out of the question. Isn’t the attainment of such a goal—“</p><p>“Worth four people’s lives?” she interrupted. She looked up at him, jaw tight with anger.</p><p>Conrad’s eyes narrowed, but his voice remained even as he replied. “Something for which those people would willingly sacrifice themselves.”</p><p>“Considering we can’t ask them, we’re never going to know for sure, are we?”</p><p>They were both silent for a time after that. Catherine sipped her coffee and tried to ignore how Conrad just stood there, quiet and statue-still.</p><p>After a while, he said, “You will not abandon your work.” It was part question, part command.</p><p>She finished the last of her coffee and sighed. “No, I won’t.”</p><p>Conrad gave her a slow smile.</p><p><em>That’s the way a lizard would smile,</em> she thought.</p><p>“Good. Now, is there any service I may perform for you?”</p><p>Sometimes she found his formal manner charming. Other times, like now, she found it cold and distant.</p><p>“We could use some...” She looked down, unable to meet his gaze. “Fresh supplies.”</p><p>His lizard smile returned. “It will be my pleasure.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-4">CHAPTER 4</span><a href="#chapter-4" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After Conrad left, Catherine was able to relax a little. While she was grateful for both the tutelage and assistance he’d provided over the past few months, she was always on edge when he was around. There was something indefinably wrong about him that set off alarm bells in the back of her mind. Beyond his appearance and manner—and aside from what she suspected he did in order to procure more “supplies” for her work—he drew in the energy of his surroundings, as if he were some kind of living black hole. Light, heat, even her own vitality seemed to drain into him, and she felt weary after spending any length of time in his presence. His departure always came as a relief. She was never able to fully relax when Conrad was in the house, and now that he was gone, she knew she should try to lie down and get some sleep. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d gotten any decent rest, let alone a full eight hours.</p><p>As a doctor, she well understood the effects of sleep deprivation, both physical and mental. Logically, she knew that she couldn’t do her best work if she didn’t take care of herself. <em>You have to take care of the machine,</em> as she always told her patients. Used to tell. The way she’d neglected her practice the last few months, it was all but dead. But that was a small price to pay to achieve her ultimate goal. She would give anything, <em>do</em> anything, to make it happen.</p><p>Conrad’s question—which she’d both interrupted and completed—came back to her.</p><p><em>Isn’t the attainment of such a goal worth four people’s lives?</em></p><p>She didn’t want to think like that. She was supposed to be a healer, for Christ’s sake! But despite her protestations to Conrad, she couldn’t deny that deep down she <em>did think</em> that way. She wasn’t proud of the fact, but there it was. However, even though she knew how important it was to get her rest, emotionally she found it almost impossible to tear herself away from her work. About the only time she slowed down was to make a fresh pot of coffee, and she justified that to herself only because she needed the caffeine to keep her alert. She couldn’t afford to slow down. She had to keep pushing herself. They were depending on her.</p><p>She was no psychologist, but she had done a psych rotation in med school, and she knew that while it was vital to keep pushing herself if she hoped to succeed, there was another, deeper reason she refused to slow down. If she kept her mind busy, she didn’t have time to think about anything but work. It was when she allowed herself to rest that she remembered—or worse, dreamed.</p><p>She finished her coffee, got up from the table, and poured herself a refill. She headed back to the table, but instead of taking her seat again, she set the mug down, then walked past the kitchen, down a short hallway off to the left, and entered the family room. The lights were off, as they always were these days. She never went in there anymore, so there was no point in wasting electricity. She reached for the wall switch, but couldn’t find it. She couldn’t have forgotten where it was... could she? This was her <em>home.</em> She should be able to remember something as basic as the location of a light switch. She fumbled in the dark for several moments before her fingers finally encountered it and she flipped it with a sharp gesture of irritation, although inside she felt more than a little relief.</p><p>The illumination from the track lighting over the couch dazzled her eyes for a second, and she raised a hand to shield them. When her vision adjusted, she lowered her hand and saw that the room looked the same as always, with the exception of a light coating of dust on the cherrywood coffee table and the black leather couch. It almost looked like the room was covered with a thin layer of snow. No, she decided, it was more like she was looking at a faded photograph. A large flatscreen TV hung on the wall above the fireplace. The latter was empty and cold, but there used to be flames in there almost every night, even in summer. On the mantel above the fireplace beneath the television were a number of framed pictures. As Catherine stood there, she experienced the strange feeling that she was somehow trespassing in her own home.</p><p>She crossed the crème-colored carpet and stopped in front of the mantel. The first photo she picked up was one of her and Marshall on their wedding day. Both of them were laughing at something the photographer had said—she couldn’t remember what. It was her favorite picture of the two of them. The joy they exuded in that frozen moment perfectly captured the essence of their relationship. Love was only part of it, although of course, the largest part. They had genuinely enjoyed each other’s company, too. Some couples said they were also best friends, but in their case, it had been true. Marshall looked so handsome in the photo, and so young. They’d been in their early twenties when they married, but even so, the man he would become was visible. Thinner, a bit more hair, but the playful intelligence was present in his brown eyes, and it would only sharpen as the years progressed. And his smile... God, how she missed it.</p><p>She placed the picture back on the mantel and picked up another, this one of a pretty teenage girl with long brown hair, dressed in a tie-dyed T-shirt and shorts, sitting on the ground surrounding by flowers. Catherine had taken this picture of Bekah herself in the spring, out in the garden. She and Bekah had spent so many wonderful hours planning, planting, and tending the garden. It had been so long since she’d gone out back, she didn’t want to think about the kind of condition it was in. She supposed it was nothing but a tangle of high grass and weeds.</p><p>She remembered exactly when she’d taken this picture of Bekah. Eight days before her fifteenth birthday. Nine days before she’d gotten her learner’s permit. Twenty-three days before her father took her out for her first night-time driving lesson. That had been four months ago. It was the last time Catherine had seen either of them alive.</p><p>She didn’t recall much about the night itself after seeing them off. She assumed the police called her at one point, and she must have called someone after that, because she had a vague memory of sobbing in someone’s arms. She thought it might have been Ronetta, her office manager, but she wasn’t certain.</p><p>The details of what had happened to her husband and daughter, though, those she remembered, or at least could imagine, perfectly.</p><p>At approximately 8:40, Marshall and Bekah—in Marshall’s BMW, Bekah behind the wheel, excited and nervous—approached a railroad crossing outside of town. They got there just as the warning lights came on and the wooden crossing gate lowered. Bekah braked and together she and her father waited while the train passed. Over the months since, Catherine had wondered what, if anything, they’d talked about. She was certain no music had been playing. As much as Bekah would have loved to cruise to some tunes, her dad would never have permitted such a distraction while she was in the early stages of her driver’s education. She thought they might’ve rolled down the windows so they could better listen to the sound of the train’s passage and feel the wind it kicked up. She imagined them looking at each other, grinning and sharing a special moment, just the two of them, father and daughter.</p><p>The train passed, the crossing gate lifted, and Bekah took her foot off the brake, gently pressed the gas, and eased over the tracks, looking both ways as the BMW juddered across. Once safely on the other side, Bekah accelerated. An instant later a pickup with its lights off came flying out of the darkness, weaving back and forth, its driver one Earl Fulmer, a local plumber who’d just left a poker game at a buddy’s house, running with more alcohol than blood in his veins. Earl hit Bekah and Marshall head-on at what the police estimated was in excess of seventy miles per hour. There were no survivors.</p><p>As a doctor, Catherine knew her husband and daughter had died quickly, and despite the horrific injuries they’d sustained, they hadn’t suffered. At least, not for long. But even though she knew this intellectually, emotionally she imagined their experience of the accident as very different. She knew that human perceptions became heightened during times of extreme stress, giving rise to the common belief that a person’s life flashes before their eyes at such times. She imagined the accident seeming to occur in torturous slow motion while Marshall and Bekah’s consciousnesses operated at normal speed. If that were true, every wound they suffered would have seemed to take an eternity to inflict. The agony would have been inconceivable. She knew it was a foolish scenario to imagine, one that had no firm basis in scientific facts, but in her heart she believed it to be true, so she grieved not only for the loss of her loved ones, but for the unimaginable suffering they had endured before finally dying.</p><p>She looked at Bekah’s photo one last time, brushing the tip of her index finger across her daughter’s hair, feeling only cold glass. She replaced the picture on the mantel and walked out of the room, flipping off the light switch as she went. She passed through the kitchen, ignoring the coffee, opened the basement door, and headed down the stairs.</p><p>In the first days after the accident, Catherine had wished she’d ridden along with Marshall and Bekah that night. Wished she’d died with them. But that was before the morning Conrad Dippel visited her office, not as a patient, but as what he called a “potential colleague.” He said he’d read about her “lamentable loss” in the <em>Broadsider,</em> and had what he believed might be a solution to her “profound emotional distress.” She’d almost tossed him out on his ass right there and then, but there was something in the tone of his voice, an unwavering confidence that made her want to listen to what he had to say, regardless of how crazy it might sound. Conrad had more than words with which to convince her, too. He’d brought a briefcase filled with the results of hundreds of experiments. The data had been intriguing, but nowhere near as intriguing as the demonstration he gave her in the temporary lab he’d established in the abandoned bicycle factory.</p><p>She’d watched him kill a rat by cutting its throat, stitch it up, and then—after administrating a combination of chemicals to the small corpse, in conjunction with some chanted words and hand gestures that she was certain were just for show—bring the animal back to life.</p><p>At that point, Conrad Dippel moved from “potential colleague” to a fully-fledged one.</p><p>Catherine had left the fluorescent lights on when she’d exited the basement, and had no trouble making her way across the lab. Much of the equipment was Conrad’s, transferred from the bicycle factory, but she’d added to it over the previous few months. A stainless steel operating table stood in the center of the basement, an array of surgical equipment laid out atop a table close by. Another table contained vials, jars, and beakers filled with various chemicals, along with other necessary equipment: pipettes, scales, microscopes, slides, and more. Stored on the floor beneath the table were several plastic containers labeled NuFlesh Biotech. Catherine ignored everything and crossed to the large horizontal freezer on the far side of the room. The machine’s powerful hum filled the basement, and she could feel its vibrations through the soles of her feet as she approached. She reached toward its metal surface, the cold kissing her skin before her fingers came in contact with the metal.</p><p>“I won’t rest until we’re together again,” she said in a soft, loving voice. “I promise.”</p><p>She lingered there a moment longer before turning away and once more resuming her work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Hey, Joe. What’s the word?”</p><p>Joe Riley sat on the curb outside the Fill ‘Er Up convenience store. He’d just finished eating an energy bar, and now was nursing a cup of brown water that the store manager had the gall to call coffee. But it was warm, and that was all he cared about. He looked up as Billy Sutphin approached and gave him a weak smile.</p><p>“Sucks is the word. How ‘bout you?”</p><p>“Same.”</p><p>Billy settled onto the curb next to Joe with a grunt, knee joints popping.</p><p>“Gettin’ old,” Billy said.</p><p>“Aren’t we all?”</p><p>Joe didn’t think Billy was all that old. In his mid-fifties, maybe. It was hard to tell people’s ages when they lived on the street. Such a life took its toll, and it was possible Billy could be in his thirties and only looked twenty years older. It didn’t help that his thick brown beard was shot through with gray. Joe had only been homeless for four months, and even in that short time, he’d changed to the point where he didn’t like looking in a mirror. His face was leaner, complexion sallower, eyes bloodshot, the flesh beneath puffy and bruised-looking. He did his best to keep his teeth clean, but they’d yellowed, and one of the bottom left molars ached all the time. He figured he probably had a cavity. Too bad he didn’t have enough money for a dentist.</p><p>Joe wasn’t well acquainted with Billy, but Brennan wasn’t a large town, and its homeless population tended to know one another at least well enough to say hi and shoot the shit now and again. They also tended to keep an eye on one another, make sure folks were doing okay, staying healthy, both physically and mentally. They called this “checking in,” and Joe recognized that was what Billy was doing now. There was also a certain kind of networking that went on among Brennan’s homeless. Tips were passed along—which church was giving away secondhand clothes, which buildings were vacant and good for a few nights of sheltered sleep before the cops rousted everyone out. Vital information if you wanted to survive on the street.</p><p>“Tried my luck at the highway exit today,” Billy said. “Stood there all afternoon holding a ‘will work for food’ sign.” He shivered.</p><p>Homeless folk knew to dress in layers when it was cold, and Billy wore a shirt and hoodie beneath an unzipped parka. But even with his limited experience, Joe knew that no matter how warmly you dressed, you could never keep the cold entirely at bay. Hell, he was dressed in layers too, only he had on his Dad’s old army jacket instead of a parka, and he felt the night’s chill. It was why he’d gotten the coffee in the first place. He offered Billy a sip to warm him up, but Billy declined with a shake of his head. It was too easy to pass germs that way, and homeless folk avoided getting sick at all costs. Joe felt stupid for forgetting that.</p><p>“How did it go?” he asked.</p><p>Billy shrugged. “‘Bout as well as you’d expect. I need to shave off this damned beard. Makes me look too scary, you know? People don’t want to stop and open their windows to talk to a guy that looks like some kind of backwoods killer out of a horror movie. You’re smart to keep yourself cleanshaven. Men look less intimidating that way.”</p><p>Maybe so, but Joe’s first winter being homeless was approaching, and he figured he’d better start working on a beard if he wanted to keep warm. He finished the rest of his coffee, sat the empty cup on the ground, then lit a cigarette. He offered one to Billy, and this time the man accepted. They sat in silence for a few moments, smoking and watching cars pass by on the street, some of the drivers pulling into Fill ‘Er Up to get gas or pick up some items inside. Joe noticed that Billy’s hands shook as he smoked, and there was something about the way they trembled that didn’t look like it was due to the cold, or at least, not only the cold. As far as Joe knew, the guy wasn’t into alcohol or drugs, so he wasn’t going through withdrawal. Joe hoped he wasn’t coming down with something.</p><p>“How was your day?” Billy asked after a bit.</p><p>“Not very productive.”</p><p>“Where did you try? You know what they say, it’s all about location, location, location.”</p><p>Joe thought about lying, but he didn’t see any point to it. Pride—foolish pride, anyway—was useless on the street. “I didn’t try. I just walked around town most of the day, moving from one place to another. Thinking.”</p><p>Billy took a last drag on his cigarette, dropped it to the ground, and crushed it out beneath the sole of his running shoe. He then turned to Joe. “I know it’s hard, man. I’ve been homeless for almost four years now, and it still ain’t easy for me to ask folks for money. But sometimes we have to do things we don’t like to survive, you know? You can’t let your pride get in the way. It’s like a Buddhist thing. You have to die to the self in order to reach enlightenment.”</p><p>Joe had no idea what the man was talking about, but he understood the basic sentiment.</p><p>“Sometimes it feels like pride’s the only thing I got left.” Joe finished his cigarette and crushed it out.</p><p>He’d had a good job working for the county, driving a snow plow in the winter and doing road work in the summer. He liked being outdoors—he wasn’t the sit-behind-a-desk type—and he liked feeling that the work he did helped make people’s lives a little easier. Then the lousy economy forced the county to make some budget cuts, and Joe was laid off. A week later his wife filed for divorce, took their little girl, and moved to her mother’s in Ash Creek. He hadn’t been able to afford a lawyer, so Sheila ended up with sole custody of their daughter, and he’d ended up paying both child and spousal support. He’d looked for other work—every damned day he looked—but no one was hiring. Eventually his unemployment ran out, the bank foreclosed on his home, he lost his car, and the next thing he knew, he became a resident of the street. He told himself it was temporary, just until he could get back on his proverbial feet. That had been four months ago, and he was still here, a victim not of booze, drugs, or mental illness—just plain old lousy luck. He’d adjusted as best he could, but the one thing he hadn’t been able to accept was asking strangers for money. It was one thing to be homeless, but it was another thing to be a beggar. Not that he’d ever use that word in front of Billy. He’d been on the street too long to make judgments about what others did to survive. He had no idea what the man’s story was and how he’d ended up living like this. That kind of personal information was kept to one’s self on the street, shared only with the closest of confidants. But whatever Billy’s story was, Joe knew the man had one. Everyone did.</p><p>“Tell you what,” Billy said, “I managed to score a few dollars today. How about we head on over to the Foxhole for a couple slices of pie? My treat.”</p><p>“I appreciate what you’re trying to do, but I don’t need cheering up. Besides, if I have a hard time taking charity from strangers, what makes you think I’ll have an easier time taking it from you?”</p><p>Billy grinned. “You got to start somewhere, right? C’mon.” He took hold of Joe’s upper arm and stood. Joe allowed the man to lift him to his feet.</p><p>“Well... it <em>has</em> been a while since I’ve had a good piece of pie.”</p><p>Billy clapped him on the back. “There you go!”</p><p>The two men started walking in the direction of the diner, taking alleys for short cuts. Not only did alleys save time, but you could find some good stuff in them. Discarded or lost objects you might be able to sell for a couple bucks, even cast-off clothing sometimes. Sure, alleys could be dark and intimidating, and they didn’t smell all that good, but they were useful, and when you were homeless, that was all that mattered.</p><p>They were only a block away from the Foxhole, walking through an alley between a coin-operated laundry and pizza joint when Joe had the feeling they were being followed. Before he’d become homeless, he might’ve ignored the sensation, figuring it was just his imagination. Who didn’t walk through an alley with their guard up? But during his relatively short time on the street, Joe’s survival instincts had been sharpened, and he knew better than to dismiss any feeling, no matter how trivial it seemed. He gripped Billy’s upper arm to stop him, and then glanced back over his shoulder. He honestly didn’t expect to see anything, so it was a shock when he saw the figure standing behind them. It was even more of a shock to see the large, cruel-looking knife clutched in the man’s hand. <em>Was the blade black?</em> It sure looked that way to Joe.</p><p>“Good evening, gentleman,” the man said. “My apologies, but you both have something I need, and I’m afraid I’m going to have to take it from you. I assure you, this is nothing personal, and if it’s any consolation, know that your sacrifice will not only help further the cause of science, it will also help bring about a most glorious change unlike any the world has ever seen.”</p><p>Joe turned to Billy. “Do you have any idea what the hell he’s—“</p><p>That was as far as he got before the man with the knife sprang at them.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dispatching the men was accomplished easily enough. A pair of quick, deep slices to the throat, and all Conrad had to do was step back as the men fell to the ground and wait for them to bleed out. He had no aversion to cutting into still-living bodies, but he preferred not to get any more blood on him than necessary. It didn’t take long for their blood flow to diminish, and then Conrad went to work. He selected the clean-shaven man first, judging him to be younger than his bearded companion and likely in better condition. He raised his obsidian blade over his head, and the runes engraved upon it glowed with silver-blue light.</p><p>“In your name, my lady.”</p><p>Then he crouched next to the body and went to work.</p><h2><span id="chapter-5">CHAPTER 5</span><a href="#chapter-5" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Blood was everywhere—on the walls, the floor, the furniture, even the ceiling. It looked as if someone had carried in large buckets of the red stuff and splashed it all over the living room, taking pains to make sure that no surface was left untouched. There was so much blood that at first Sam couldn’t see anything but crimson. Then a second later, his eyes registered the two forms on the floor in front of the couch, one lying prone, the other straddling it. Both were covered with so much gore that he didn’t recognize them right away. The one on the floor was larger, taller, and beefier than the other. Sam thought it might be a man, but given the state of the figure’s face—or rather what little was left of it—he couldn’t tell for sure. The flannel shirt and jeans didn’t help much, but the large boots were a giveaway. They were Earl’s, which made sense, considering the cabin was his as well. His left hand was clenched around a small black object which Sam immediately recognized as a statuette of Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead.</p><p>The figure straddling Earl’s chest was thinner, shorter, and dressed in a blood-soaked T-shirt and a pair of cut-off shorts. The long hair was so matted with blood, it was impossible to determine its true color by sight, but Sam knew it was a light chestnut brown. He also knew that the hair normally smelled of strawberry kiwi shampoo. He didn’t want to think about how it smelled right now.</p><p><em>Trish.</em></p><p>He hadn’t spoken her name aloud—at least, he didn’t think he had—but her gaze snapped in his direction. Her blue eyes were as empty and cold as the bottom of an arctic sea, and there was nothing remotely human in them. She had something wet and ragged clamped between her blood-slick teeth, and Sam’s stomach did a flip when he realized it was part of her father’s tongue. She tossed her head back and swallowed the grisly morsel in a single gulp, and then locked gazes with him once again. Her lips drew back from her teeth in a gesture that was more rictus than smile. She rose to her feet and stepped away from her father’s body. She moved toward Sam with the feral grace of a jungle cat, and a low keening sound came from deep in her throat. It was the sound of need, of desire, of <em>hunger.</em></p><p><em>This isn’t right,</em> Sam thought. <em>It didn’t happen like this!</em></p><p>It was the last thought he had before Trish sank her teeth into his throat.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Sam? <em>Sam!”</em></p><p>He sat up and opened his eyes, surprised by how much effort it took. Dean’s hands were on his shoulders, and Sam realized his brother had been shaking him.</p><p>He pushed Dean’s hands away and then yawned. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Dean had been sitting on the edge of the bed, but now he stood. “You were moaning and thrashing in your sleep, big time. You must’ve been having one hell of a serious dream, and not the good kind, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Sam rubbed his eyes. He didn’t remember falling asleep. “What time is it?” He glanced toward the nightstand and checked the read-out on the digital clock there: 9:13. “Wow, I must’ve been wiped out. I napped for... what, three hours or so?”</p><p>Dean walked over to the window and drew back the curtains. Light spilled into the room and stabbed Sam’s eyes. His head pounded as if he had a hangover, and he lifted a hand to block the glare as he averted his gaze.</p><p>“You slept a little longer than that, Rip Van Winkle. It’s nine in the morning.”</p><p>He’d slept for fifteen hours. Most of the time, Dean and he were lucky to get four hours a night, but every once in a while the lack of rest caught up with them and they crashed for the better part of a day. “Guess I needed to get caught up on my sleep. Sorry.”</p><p>He sat up the rest of the way and swung his feet over the side of the bed. He winced as his right foot touched the carpet, and he remembered his wound. That memory brought the rest along with it—Brennan, the mummified corpses, Frankenmutt—and he was jolted fully awake.</p><p>He looked around the room, trying to appear casual as he checked to make sure that everything was the way it should be. He had a hard time telling what was real and what wasn’t these days, especially when he’d just awakened, or was tired or stressed. But he didn’t see any hallucinations—none that were obvious, at any rate—and when after a few moments the room, the furniture, and Dean remained the same, he allowed himself to relax.</p><p>“Any coffee?” he asked.</p><p>Dean walked over to the table where a couple coffee cups from a fast-food joint sat. He brought one to Sam, then went back and took a seat. The brothers sipped their go-juice for a few moments in silence before Dean asked, “So what were you dreaming about? And if it <em>was</em> the good kind of dream, make sure you don’t leave out any naughty details.”</p><p>At first Sam couldn’t remember what he’d been dreaming about, but then the details came flooding back, and he wished they hadn’t.</p><p>“Trish.”</p><p>Dean arced an eyebrow in surprise. “Trish Hansen?”</p><p>Sam nodded and took another sip of coffee. It seemed sharp and acidic as it went down his throat, and his stomach roiled in response.</p><p>“That was a while ago,” Dean said softly. “We were teenagers.”</p><p>“Barely.”</p><p>They were silent for a few moments after that, both continuing to work on their coffee.</p><p>After a bit, Dean asked, “Why do you suppose you dreamed about her?” He didn’t look at Sam as he spoke, but there was a clear edge of tension in his voice.</p><p>“I don’t know. I guess I’ve just been thinking about death lately.”</p><p>Dean turned to him, a hard expression on his face that verged on anger. “Lately? In case you haven’t noticed, Death could be both of our middle names. If we aren’t ganking some monster, we’re watching someone we love go belly up.”</p><p><em>Someone like Bobby,</em> Sam thought, although he didn’t say it aloud. “That’s kind of what I mean. Death is so much a part of our lives that sometimes we take it for granted...” He hurried on before Dean could protest. “Until something happens to remind us. In a lot of ways, what happened to Trish was the first time I realized just how close death really is to all of us. Not just hunters, but everybody. It’s always there, just a heartbeat away, waiting for the right time, you know?”</p><p>Dean nodded gravely. “Yes. Yes, I do.”</p><p><em>Of course you do,</em> Sam thought. For a short time, Dean had actually served as a stand-in for Death with a capital D.</p><p>Sam went on. “Besides, we were talking about <em>Frankenstein</em> yesterday, so that’s another probable reason I was thinking about death—at least subconsciously—as I conked out.”</p><p>“Yeah. Probably.” Dean’s tone was distant, distracted, and Sam knew that he was remembering Trish. Remembering how she died... and remembering the horrible thing she had become in death.</p><p>Sam wanted to take Dean’s mind—and his own—off Trish Hansen, so he put his almost-empty coffee cup on the nightstand and stood, trying not to grimace as he put weight on his injured ankle. It hurt, but not as bad as it had yesterday. “So, any new developments regarding Frankenmutt while I was zonked?” he asked.</p><p>“Not so fast there, pilgrim,” Dean said.</p><p>“Pilgrim?”</p><p>“Caught a cowboy flick on TV last night while you were off in dreamland,” Dean said, sounding a bit apologetic. “Anyway, before we get back to work, I want to take a look at that ankle of yours.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“We don’t know exactly what the hell Frankenmutt is, and after the way you passed out last night, I want to make sure that you didn’t pick up something nasty when he bit you.”</p><p>“I didn’t pass out,” Sam muttered. “I fell asleep.”</p><p>Dean had eased up on the overprotective big brother bit over the last couple years, but he still got on Sam’s nerves whenever he fell back into his old role. Still, Sam couldn’t fault his brother’s reasoning, and besides, he knew Dean wouldn’t let up until he was satisfied.</p><p>“Whatever. Let’s take a look at that ankle and make sure you didn’t catch Frankenrabies.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>Sam sat on the foot of his bed and crossed his right leg onto his left. He’d fallen asleep in his clothes, and by longstanding agreement between the brothers, Dean had left him that way. He’d taken his shoes off before bandaging his ankle the night before, though, so all he needed to do was pull up the pant leg a little and begin unwrapping the bandage. Dean rose from the table and walked over to the bed to get a closer look at the wound.</p><p>“You’re hovering,” Sam said.</p><p>“Deal with it,” Dean replied.</p><p>Sam finished removing the bandage and was gratified to see the wound looked greatly improved since yesterday. It wasn’t bleeding anymore and scabs had already started to form. The tissue around the wound wasn’t swollen, nor was it red, but he probed it with his fingertips to be sure. The flesh was tender, but it felt cool: no infection.</p><p>“I gotta admit, it looks pretty good,” Dean said.</p><p>“So no more worries about Frankenrabies?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We’ll see.”</p><p>Sam started to rewrap the wound, but then decided to let it breathe for a while.</p><p>“As I was saying, anything new?”</p><p>“Not really. No mysterious wasting deaths were reported, so it looks like Frankenmutt didn’t drain anyone’s battery last night. I researched black dogs some more on the net, but didn’t find anything we don’t already know. I also looked into Brennan’s history, but near as I can tell, until recently nothing even remotely supernatural has ever happened here. When it comes to the wide world of weird, this may be the least interesting town in the whole damn country. Hell, I’m thinking about retiring here some day.”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Assuming we get rid of Frankenmutt first.”</p><p>“And the Double-Header.”</p><p>Sam frowned. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Dean grinned, then went back to the table and turned on the laptop. Sam hobbled over, and since there was only one chair, Dean made him take it. Dean looked over his shoulder as the screen came to life and displayed the webpage for the <em>Broadsider.</em> The headline read Local Unemployment Reaches All-Time High.</p><p>“Scroll down,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam did so, and toward the bottom of the page, he found a smaller headline: Man Reports Encounter with Two-Headed Monster. The headline was only a link, so Sam clicked it and an instant later, the entire article was displayed on the screen.</p><p><strong>MAN REPORTS ENCOUNTER WITH TWO-HEADED MONSTER</strong></p><blockquote><p>Late last evening, Brennan resident Lyle Swanson called 911 to report that what he referred to as a “monster” was raiding the trash containers behind his house. When Brennan police arrived at the Swanson residence, they discovered several trash containers had been overturned and their contents scattered, but they found no evidence of who or what was responsible. When the police spoke with Mr. Swanson, he described hearing noises outside, and when he looked through his back door window to investigate, he saw a creature that resembled a “large naked man with two heads and four arms” going through his trash and “eating all the good stuff.” Police took Mr. Swanson’s statement and suggested he purchase trash containers with locking mechanisms to prevent a recurrence of the incident.</p></blockquote><p>Dean chuckled. “Man, I don’t know what Lyle was drinking last night, but I’ll have a double.”</p><p>Sam looked over his shoulder at his brother. “You don’t think what he saw was real?”</p><p>Dean frowned. “C’mon, Sammy. I only wanted you to see this so you’d get a laugh out of it. I didn’t think you’d take it seriously.” His eyes narrowed as if he was suddenly suspicious of something, and Sam knew he was worried that his little brother’s crazy was starting to show again.</p><p>“Think about it,” Sam said. “Frankenmutt looked like he was a combination of different dog parts, right? So maybe this Double-Header is the same kind of thing, only he’s a combination of different <em>people.”</em></p><p>Dean regarded the computer screen for a moment then turned his attention back to Sam. He sighed.</p><p>“You grab a shower. I’ll track down Lyle’s address.”</p><p>Sam nodded, rose from the chair, and started toward the bathroom, almost shuffling as he went. He wondered when the coffee he’d had would finally kick in. Despite all the sleep he’d gotten, he felt so damn tired...</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean listened to the sound of the shower while he worked on digging up Lyle Swanson’s address. Sometimes living in close quarters with Sam got on his nerves, and he knew Sam felt the same way about him. What two brothers could spend almost every moment together and not irritate each other? It was normal human behavior, no harm, no foul. But he’d never told Sam that he often found the sounds of someone else close by—say, for instance, a running shower—comforting, even soothing. Footsteps across a floor, the scrape of a chair being pulled away from a table, the tapping of computer keys, the creak of bedsprings, the soft breathing of someone else sleeping. As Sam had pointed out, they spent so much of their time dealing with death. Being surrounded by simple day-to-day sounds, <em>human</em> sounds, helped remind Dean that there was life in the world, too, and that he wasn’t alone, not as long as he had family.</p><p>Dean found his thoughts drifting toward Trish Hansen. He hadn’t thought of her in years, but now that Sam had brought her up, Dean was having a hard time thinking about anything else. One year in their early teens, their dad had gotten a lead on a possible location of Yellow-Eyes, the demon that had killed their mother. Supposedly, the demon had been spotted by a hunter in Alaska, and John Winchester was hell-bent on running the bastard to ground and making him pay for what he’d done. But his desire for vengeance didn’t cloud his judgment, at least not where his sons were concerned. John wasn’t about to take Sam and Dean along on such a potentially dangerous hunt, so he’d arranged for them to stay with a friend in Washington State. Walter Hansen wasn’t a hunter himself, but a master forger who provided false documents and ID for hunters to use. He also ran something of an unofficial trading post, as some of his clients paid him in barter. Weapons were the most common alternate currency, but sometimes they paid with other, more... esoteric items that they acquired during the course of their work. Dean hadn’t cared much about any of that, however. At his age, the most important thing about Walter Hansen was that he had a teenage daughter named Trish.</p><p>He remembered the first time he saw her. Dad hadn’t told them that his friend had a daughter, so when Walter let them into his cabin one early spring evening, both Dean and Sam had been surprised to see a girl sitting cross-legged in front of the fireplace. She looked to be around his age, maybe a year older. Her complexion was light, her features delicate, and the brown hair that flowed over her shoulders seemed almost bronze in the firelight. Her gray sweater was big and baggy on her, but her faded jeans hugged her slender legs, giving Dean a tantalizing idea of what the rest of her body might look like. She wore no shoes, and she held her bare feet in her hands, as if the fire wasn’t enough to warm them. Later, he would take note of the playful intelligence that danced in her eyes, would feel a strange thrill in his chest whenever she let out one of her too-loud laughs. But what struck him most at that moment was the way she turned her head to look at them and smiled, big and bright, as if welcoming old friends instead of greeting a trio of strangers. It may well have been the best smile he’d ever seen on a woman.</p><p>“We good to go?”</p><p>Startled, Dean looked up from the laptop screen to see Sam standing by the table, hair a tousled wet mess, motel towel wrapped around his waist.</p><p>“Dude, I thought we had a rule about running around naked in front of each other.”</p><p>“I’m not naked.”</p><p>“Close enough. Get dressed, Towel Boy. I got Lyle’s addy. Found it in an online phone registry.” Dean closed the laptop.</p><p>“Good. When I was in the shower—“</p><p>Dean held up his hands. “Please! There are some things I do <em>not</em> need to know. What happens in the shower, stays in the shower.”</p><p>Sam sighed. “I was going to say that I had an idea how we can set a trap for Frankenmutt.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, that I do need to know. You can fill me in on the way to Lyle’s.”</p><p>As Sam finished getting ready, Dean sat back in the chair and did his best not to think about Trish Hansen.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“We’ve seen a lot of crazy over the years, but Lyle’s got a good shot at winning a special place in the Winchester Hall of Weird.”</p><p>The brothers were in the crapmobile, heading back to Arbor Vale Apartments after interviewing Lyle Swanson. Sam sipped a latte with two shots of espresso that he’d picked up at a coffee shop on the way. Normally, he was careful to limit his caffeine intake, but the meager boost he’d received from his morning cuppa had already faded, and now he felt like taking a nap. He hoped he wasn’t coming down with something. Killing monsters was hard enough without having to do it while coughing, sneezing, and dripping snot.</p><p>“It didn’t help that he smelled like a distillery, and it wasn’t even noon yet,” Dean added.</p><p>Sam looked at his brother. He wanted to say something about pots calling kettles black, but he didn’t have the energy to get into an argument right then. He took another sip of coffee before speaking. “He didn’t seem that bad to me.”</p><p>The Winchesters had foregone their usual pose as FBI agents when visiting Lyle. They didn’t think the man would buy a couple Feds dropping by to check on a report of a two-headed, four-armed naked man eating garbage. Even with all their experience creating cover stories to explain their presence at crime scenes, they figured they’d have a tough time selling that one. Instead they’d told him they were staff reporters for <em>Ohio</em> magazine assigned to do a feature story on the state’s paranormal hotspots. Luckily, Lyle didn’t ask to see their nonexistent journalist IDs.</p><p>He hadn’t been able to tell them much more than they’d already gotten from the article in the <em>Broadsider,</em> and when he showed them the place where the multi-limbed monster had rooted through his trash, there were no discernible signs that anything out of the ordinary had been responsible. There were still remnants of garbage strewn across Lyle’s back yard: stained paper plates, empty liters of soda, crusty microwave meal trays, crumpled snack chip bags, and wadded-up fast-food wrappers. Lyle was a middle-aged man who proudly told them he was a lifelong bachelor, and from what Sam saw, the guy ate like one. When they asked him why he hadn’t cleaned up the mess yet, he said, “I ain’t touchin’ that crap! You think I wanna get monster cooties?”</p><p>Sam and Dean had exchanged looks at the cootie remark. It explained a great deal about why Lyle was a bachelor.</p><p>“Sam, his trash got hit by some kind of animal. A raccoon or a possum, maybe even a coyote. Not freaky Siamese twins.”</p><p>“Conjoined,” Sam said. “The proper term is <em>conjoined</em> twins.”</p><p>“Whatever. The point is that there’s nothing supernatural going on at Lyle’s place. He doesn’t need us; he needs a good shrink.”</p><p>“What about the peanut butter jar?”</p><p>“What about it?”</p><p>“The lid was off.”</p><p>“Yeah, I noticed. Are you saying that’s proof something with hands—like four of them—raided Lyle’s outdoor buffet? He may have thrown it away like that, with the lid and jar separate, and even if the lid was still on, raccoons have got hands, right? They could’ve gotten it off.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Sam said.</p><p>The EMF detector hadn’t picked up any energy emissions, and they hadn’t found any footprints, human or animal. They’d pretended to take notes, and they promised Lyle they’d send him a copy of the magazine when their article appeared. They left after that, and although Sam couldn’t disagree with his brother’s assessment of Lyle, he also couldn’t escape the feeling that the man was telling the truth. Call it hunter’s intuition. Maybe with a little work, he could convince Dean to reconsider Lyle’s story, but he’d worry about that later. Right now, they had a monster dog to catch.</p><p>They parked in front of the building closest to the pond, and walked down the hill toward the water. Both were armed—Dean’s shotgun loaded with regular shells instead of rock salt this time—and Sam carried a plastic shopping bag emblazoned with the logo of a large department store chain.</p><p>“I don’t know about this plan of yours, Sammy. It seems a little out there, even for you.”</p><p>Sam tried not to bristle at the implication—which admittedly he might be reading into his brother’s words—that his fragile mental state was responsible for him coming up with his unorthodox plan to lure the monster dog. “We know Frankenmutt drains life force, right? And after our encounter with him yesterday, he took a lot of damage. He’s going to need to heal, and that means he’ll have to feed.”</p><p>“Assuming he <em>can</em> heal,” Dean pointed out. “He might be like a movie zombie and just keep on rotting and getting nastier no matter how much he feeds.”</p><p>“Possibly,” Sam said. “But he didn’t show any sign of decay yesterday, right?”</p><p>“I guess not. He was one butt-ugly pooch, but his meat looked fresh enough.”</p><p>The brothers reached the pond, turned right, and headed into the woods.</p><p>Sam lowered his voice. “So if he needs to heal, he’ll be hungry, but he won’t be looking for food to eat, he’ll be looking for life force to absorb. That’s what we’re going to give him—or at least pretend to.”</p><p>“I get the logic,” Dean said, “I just don’t think that Frankenmutt’s going to fall for it. He may be some kind of freak, but he’s still a dog, and their senses are too sharp to...” He trailed off and pointed.</p><p>Sam looked where his brother indicated and saw the body of a rabbit lying on the ground, partially hidden by underbrush. At least, he thought it was a rabbit. The body had shrunken in upon itself, making the animal look like a skeleton covered with a layer of ill-fitting fur.</p><p>“Looks like Frankenmutt had a snack,” Dean said softly.</p><p>Sam nodded, and they continued deeper into the woods.</p><p>They encountered the desiccated corpses of other animals—more rabbits, a couple groundhogs, and a cat. The latter had no collar, and Sam figured it for a stray.</p><p>When they came upon a small clearing, Sam said, “This should do.”</p><p>Dean nodded and kept watch, shotgun at the ready, while Sam went to work. He knelt down and placed the shopping bag on the ground next to him. First he removed the lifelike baby doll they’d purchased from the store’s toy department. He’d already removed it from the packaging in the car, and he placed the pink, rubbery thing upon a small pile of leaves.</p><p>“Man, look at us, playing with dolls,” Dean muttered.</p><p>Sam ignored him.</p><p>Next, Sam took a container of baby powder—Softness for the Skin You Love was this brand’s slogan—and he sprinkled a good amount on the doll. He put the powder back in the bag and then withdrew a can of ready-made formula. He opened it and poured a little of the thick white liquid on the doll’s mouth. Not too much, just enough to simulate a baby who’s fed and needs its mouth wiped. He then set up the most important part of the illusion. He took his smart phone out of his jacket pocket, cranked the volume up as high as it would go, and activated the audio file he’d downloaded earlier. The sound of a baby crying echoed through the woods, and Sam placed the phone on the ground close to the doll’s head. Then he and Dean retreated to a pair of nearby trees and took cover. Sam set the plastic bag and the open can of formula on the ground, drew his Beretta, and together he and his brother waited.</p><p>The reasoning behind Sam’s plan was simple. Frankenmutt needed life force, and what had more life energy—at least in mystic terms—than a baby? Spiritually speaking, a baby was full of <em>potential</em> life energy. It was like a bank account full of money that no one had started to withdraw from yet. That made it a rich source of food for a creature like Frankenmutt. At least, that’s what Sam hoped.</p><p>When he’d been without a soul, Sam might’ve used a real baby as a lure. Oh, he’d have done everything he could to make sure the baby wasn’t harmed, but if something went wrong and the child died, soulless Sam wouldn’t—couldn’t have shed a tear. The thought made him sick, and he was glad those days were behind him. When Sam had first told Dean about his idea, Dean had admitted it had potential—even if it was a little on the demented side—but he’d voiced some doubts. <em>You can make it sound like a real baby, but it’ll still smell like plastic and rubber. Once Frankenmutt gets close enough to get a good whiff of Sammy Junior, he’ll know something’s wrong and turn tail.</em></p><p>Sam agreed that was a possibility, which was the reason for the baby powder and the formula: to make the doll seem more like a real baby. Sam had no idea if Frankenmutt had ever had a real life as a dog—or separate dogs—before becoming a freakish conglomerate monstrosity, but if he had, Sam hoped that somewhere in his doggy brain resided the memory of what babies smelled like. If not, then he hoped the creature would be so damned hungry that the cries of distress would be enough to lure it, and it wouldn’t be put off by the scent of plastic.</p><p>He’d set his phone to play the audio file on a loop, and several minutes passed while they listened to the baby’s cries without any sign of Frankenmutt.</p><p>“Maybe he filled up on animals and he’s not hungry anymore,” Dean said. “Or maybe he’s too far away to hear.”</p><p>Sam figured either was a possibility. “Let’s give it a bit longer before—“ He broke off. He’d caught sight of something out of the corner of his eye, and he spun toward it, Beretta raised and ready to fire.</p><p>He expected to see Frankenmutt bearing down on them, but instead he saw a man standing a dozen yards away, next to an old oak. Sam couldn’t make out his features clearly; almost as if he was viewing him through a sheet of gauze. He was of medium height and dressed in a dark suit. Blue? Black? Sam couldn’t tell. His hair color was light, most likely blond, but maybe white. His age was impossible to guess, as his facial features were a flesh-colored shimmer that rippled continuously like water.</p><p>“What?” Dean said, turning and bringing his shotgun around.</p><p>Before Sam could reply, the figure vanished. One instant he was there, the next—poof!—like he’d never existed. A wave of dizziness came over Sam, accompanied by a deep weariness that he could feel down to the bottoms of his feet. The Beretta felt suddenly heavy in his hand, and he thought it might slip from his fingers and fall to the ground. But he managed to maintain his grip on the weapon, and a second later the dizziness passed and the weariness eased, although the latter didn’t leave him entirely.</p><p>“It’s nothing,” Sam said. “Thought I saw something. I was wrong.”</p><p>Dean scowled at him, and Sam could guess what he was thinking.</p><p>“I’m fine,” he insisted. “All my marbles are more or less in place.”</p><p>Dean grunted. “It’s the <em>less</em> I’m worried about.”</p><p>Sam said nothing. So he’d had a hallucination, so what? It wasn’t his first, and he doubted it would be his last. The important thing was that it hadn’t lasted very long, and it hadn’t distracted him from—</p><p>A branch snapped behind them. Followed by a low, throaty growl.</p><p>“It’s behind us, isn’t it?” Sam said.</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>The brothers whirled around and fired.</p><h2><span id="chapter-6">CHAPTER 6</span><a href="#chapter-6" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lyle Swanson was not a happy man.</p><p>Not that this was out of character for him. Even at the best of times, he wasn’t the cheeriest of people. His fellow employees at Swifty Print had what they thought was an ironic, and hilarious, nickname for him: Mr. Sunshine. It wasn’t that he was foul-tempered. He didn’t get angry or frustrated when things went wrong, and he didn’t complain about setbacks. He wasn’t a particularly chatty man, but he didn’t avoid conversations with his coworkers, either. He was just one of those people who seem perpetually gloomy. If he’d been a cartoon character, he would’ve had a small black raincloud hovering over his head all the time. He shuffled when he walked, shoulders slumped, head tilted at a downward angle, facial features slack and drooping. He rarely smiled, and when he did, it was with the barest upturn of the mouth, the expression so muted that most people didn’t recognize it for what it was. And no one could ever remember hearing him laugh, not even so much as a soft chuckle.</p><p>There was no reason for Lyle to be a human incarnation of Eeyore, at least none that he could see. He’d had a happy enough childhood, and while he hadn’t been popular in school, no one had bullied him. In fact, most of the kids had barely noticed he existed, and the same went for the teachers. His life so far, while wholly unremarkable, had been almost entirely without conflict of any significance. Yes, he was a bit of a germaphobe, the kind of person who’s never without hand sanitizer and wipes. And he’d never had much interest in sex. It seemed like too much work and, to be frank, more than a little messy.</p><p>His job—you really couldn’t call it a career—wasn’t the most fulfilling in the world, but it paid his bills, and the benefits, while not outstanding, were sufficient for his needs. He had his own house, a small one just outside the town limits, where it was nice and quiet. When naked monsters weren’t digging in his trash can, that was.</p><p>His health was good, and according to his doctor, if he kept going as he was, there was an excellent chance he’d live to a ripe old age. There was absolutely no reason on Earth why Lyle should be, as his mother used to put it, a Gloomy Gus. He supposed he’d simply been born that way.</p><p>Today, however, he had more than ample reason to be unhappy. It was bad enough that a trash-hungry bare-assed monster had paid him a visit the day before, but what really stuck in Lyle’s craw was how everyone had reacted to his story. The police had come out to take his statement, sure, but had they done any real investigating? Had they taken photographs, dusted for fingerprints, taken plaster molds of footprints, or swabbed for DNA? Had they done anything that the crime scene investigators on TV did? Hell, no. They hadn’t even bothered to search the woods behind his property. He’d had the feeling that it had taken every ounce of control the officers possessed to keep from laughing the entire time they were talking with him.</p><p>As bad as that had been, the story in the <em>Broadsider</em> that morning had been worse. Good thing he got the paper delivered or else he might not have seen the article before heading in to work. He’d called in sick because he hadn’t wanted to deal with his fellow employees making fun of him all day. Marcy, one of Swifty Print’s managers, had answered his call, and when he told her he wasn’t coming in, she asked if he was playing hooky so he could spend the day with his new friend. Before he could respond, she’d added. <em>Just be careful. You never know what a naked man will get up to. The stories I could tell you, honey! Just remember one thing...</em> And here she’d paused for effect. <em>Forewarned is four-armed!</em></p><p>He hung up on her peal of laughter.</p><p>Then those two magazine writers had come by. They’d seemed professional enough at first. They acted as if they were genuinely interested in hearing his story, and they listened closely as he went over the details. But when he showed them the mess in the back yard, they’d begun to seem doubtful. They hadn’t said as much, but he’d caught the looks they tossed back and forth. Looks that said, <em>We got ourselves a real piece of work here.</em> Like the police, they didn’t take any photos, and that was when he knew they weren’t going to include him in their article. Magazines <em>always</em> used pictures with the stories they ran. The fact that they hadn’t bothered to take any told him everything he needed to know about what they thought of his... well, he supposed you’d call it a sighting.</p><p><em>Maybe I shouldn’t have used the word cooties,</em> he thought.</p><p>So now here he was, working in his back yard to clean up the mess left by the whatever-the-hell-it-was. He wore rubber gloves and a surgical mask to protect himself from the worst of the germs. He wished he had a pair of coveralls, too, but he didn’t. Instead, he’d donned an old long-sleeved plaid shirt and a pair of jeans, both of which he’d bag up and throw away when he finished with the clean up. Even with the gloves, he didn’t want to touch the trash. Maybe monsters didn’t have cooties as such, but something had caused those weird deaths where people shriveled up like prunes, and he wasn’t about to take any chances. He didn’t own a tool designed for picking up litter, so he’d had to improvise. He’d taken a pair of salad tongs from his kitchen, and they did the job well enough. Of course, they’d have to be thrown away too when he was finished, but that was okay. Utensils were easily replaced. A man’s life, not so much.</p><p>Lyle was bent over and in the process of picking up a torn and empty package that had once contained fudge-covered vanilla-cream sandwich cookies—his only real vice—when he felt a tingling sensation on the back of his neck. He froze there, crouching, salad tongs gripping the cookie package in one gloved hand, a plastic garbage bag for the trash he’d gathered so far in the other. Someone—<em>something</em>—was watching him.</p><p>He didn’t consider himself an especially brave man, but he didn’t think of himself as a coward, either. He didn’t like scary books or movies, but not because they frightened him. He didn’t think they were realistic. Sure, bad things happened to people—sometimes <em>really</em> bad things, but awful as they were, they were understandable, even routine in some ways. Diseases, accidents, natural disasters, and most common of all, humans being shitty to one another. But to be scared of some horrible unknown thing lurking in the shadows? It had seemed ridiculous.</p><p>Now—frozen in mid-crouch in his back yard, the surgical mask covering the lower half of his face suddenly tight and stifling—he knew how the people in those stories felt. They weren’t simply frightened, they were <em>terrified,</em> breath caught in their throats, hearts pounding a trip-hammer beat, sweat erupting from their pores, stomachs filled with ice water. They felt small and weak, caught between two all-consuming but opposing impulses: to run away as fast and far as they possibly could, and also to stand statue-still and hope to remain unnoticed by the nameless thing that stalked them. Lyle now knew what they knew—what it was like to be prey. He’d never been so scared in his life.</p><p>He heard breathing first, heavy and labored, punctuated with a soft whistling-wheezing sound, as if the lungs producing it weren’t quite working right. The sound was off to his left, and he didn’t want to turn his head to look, he really didn’t. He’d rather squeeze his eyes shut and, like a child hiding under the covers in the dark, hope that if he couldn’t see the monster, it couldn’t see him. But he turned his head anyway, he couldn’t keep himself from doing so, and when he did, he saw exactly what he expected to.</p><p>The monster had returned.</p><p>Yesterday he’d watched the creature from within the safety of his home, peeking through the small white curtain that covered the back-door window. He’d been concealed from the thing’s view, protected by a solid wooden door locked with a deadbolt. It had been a strange sight, that was for damn sure, but he hadn’t felt threatened. The situation had been so bizarre that it hadn’t seemed real. He’d felt like a detached observer, watching the creature on a TV screen. It had seemed absurd with its two heads and four arms, like something out of a child’s cartoon. But now, with the creature standing less than a dozen yards away and nothing between them but air, it didn’t seem so absurd. In fact, it was downright terrifying.</p><p>It stood six feet tall, and its naked body—aside from the extra parts—was that of a normal man. Although it carried a few extra pounds around the middle, it was in relatively good shape, with hard muscle and a light covering of black body hair. Each head had to lean to the side—one right, one left—in order for them to fit on a single body, and Lyle found himself thinking that both of the poor sons of bitches probably suffered from perpetually sore necks. The head on the right had straight black hair that hung in long greasy clumps, and an unkempt beard that was badly in need of trimming. The head on the left had a lighter complexion, and its thick hair was a soft ginger color. It was clean-shaven, with a dusting of freckles on the cheeks. Both heads held similar expressions: eyes wide and wild, mouths slack and open. A thin line of drool ran from the corner of Ginger’s mouth and dribbled onto its chest.</p><p>It stood hunched forward, no doubt because of the added weight of those extra arms and head. The second set of arms protruded from the front of the creature’s shoulders, and were thinner than the other pair, the skin lighter, body hair almost nonexistent.</p><p><em>They’re Ginger’s arms,</em> Lyle thought, and his stomach gave a flip at this realization.</p><p>Right then, all four of its arms were hanging loosely, as if it had forgotten for the moment that they were there.</p><p>Lyle noticed another detail, one he’d missed before. At the junctures where Ginger’s body parts connected with Black Hair’s were patches of skin that didn’t look right. The color and texture were strange, artificial somehow, and it reminded Lyle of the Silly Putty he’d played with as a child. Of all the wrong things there were about this creature, that not-skin was somehow the worst, and looking at it made Lyle feel sick to his stomach. Well, sicker.</p><p>For a long moment the monster stared at him with its two pairs of eyes, as if it was as surprised to see Lyle as Lyle was to see it. <em>Maybe he’s wondering what happened to</em> my <em>extra head and arms,</em> Lyle thought. The idea struck him as so ridiculous that he couldn’t help letting out a short laugh, although it sounded more like a sob. The creature started at the sound, and for an instant Lyle thought it might bolt like a frightened deer and run back to the woods. But instead its two mouths stretched into hideous lopsided grins.</p><p>“Hun!” Black-Hair said.</p><p>“Gee!” Ginger said.</p><p>There was a short pause between the sounds, but when the heads spoke a second time they did so in rapid succession, so the syllables came out as a single almost-word.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Ice collected on Lyle’s spine, and his bowels turned watery. The creature spoke in the simplistic manner of a toddler, but this time Lyle had no trouble understanding what it—they—were saying.</p><p><em>Hungry.</em></p><p>Lyle dropped the garbage bag and tongs, and ran like hell for his house. The creature let out two excited hoots, like those a large ape might make, and gave pursuit.</p><p>Lyle heard its pounding footfalls and whistle-wheeze breath, and adrenaline surged through his system, spurring him to run faster. He once again felt a tingle on the back of his neck, only now the sensation seemed to be warning him that the two-headed monstrosity was reaching for him, its fingers—nails overlong, cracked, and split—mere inches from his flesh. The feeling was so strong that he couldn’t stop himself from looking back over his shoulder, and as soon as he did, he wished he’d resisted the impulse. The creature wasn’t as close as he’d feared, about fifteen feet behind him—which was good—but the <em>way</em> it ran... It moved with a spastic, lopsided gait, as if its nervous system had short-circuited and was firing off impulses at random. Instead of reaching out to grab him as he’d pictured, all four of the creature’s arms hung limply, the extremities flailing and flopping as their owner continued to lurch after Lyle. It was without doubt the most horrible thing Lyle had ever seen. So why did it strike him as almost funny?</p><p>A giggle escaped his mouth, one tinged with more than a hint of hysteria.</p><p>As if the giggle was a cue, the creature bellowed its tag-team word again.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Lyle’s giggle became a shriek, and he faced forward and ran even faster.</p><p>He’d left the back door unlocked, and even though his hands were sweating something fierce, the rubber gloves kept his grip from being slick, so he was able to turn the knob without difficulty. People at work teased him about being OCD, but he wished they could see him right then.</p><p><em>Who’s crazy now?</em></p><p>He threw open the door, lunged inside, and slammed it shut behind him, whirled around, threw the deadbolt, engaged the smaller lock on the knob, and backed quickly away. He moved too fast, stumbled over his own feet, and fell backward, landing hard on his ass. The impact jolted his spine and caused his teeth to clack together painfully. In the process he bit into the tip of his tongue, and blood started to fill his mouth. He tried to spit, remembered the surgical mask, tore it off his face and dropped it on the kitchen floor. He then turned his head and expelled a glob of blood. It splattered onto a lower cabinet door, but he didn’t notice, and even if he had, he wouldn’t have cared. He had more important things to worry about right now than a little mess. OCD be damned.</p><p>He fixed his gaze on the door and waited.</p><p><em>It won’t get in,</em> Lyle told himself. <em>The lock’s strong. I know, because I installed it myself.</em> Besides, the way those arms were flapping around, they might not function properly. If that was so, even if the door had been unlocked, the creature might not be able to turn the knob. So no matter what, he was safe. He <em>was.</em></p><p>The door burst inward without any warning, glass shattering, hinges tearing free, the deadbolt ripping through the jamb. The door slid across the floor and bumped to a stop against Lyle’s feet.</p><p>The two-headed man stood in the now-open doorway, all four arms held out ramrod straight, palms up.</p><p><em>Guess those arms work after all,</em> he thought.</p><p>The creature lurched into the kitchen, double grins widening into twin leers.</p><p>“Hun-gee!”</p><p>Lyle heard someone laughing, and it took him a moment to realize that the sound bubbled up from his own throat. The whole thing was just too damned messed-up to take seriously.</p><p>The creature reached Lyle, knelt awkwardly before him, and placed all fours hand on the sides of the man’s face. Lyle’s laughter broke off in a gasp. The monster’s flesh was cold—so cold it burned.</p><p>Then a great heaviness settled on Lyle, and with it came a weariness more powerful than any he’d ever known. He struggled to keep his eyes open, but really, what was the point? His limbs felt as if they’d turned to lead, and although he tried to pull away from the monster’s quadruple grip, he was weak as a newborn. He couldn’t move, let alone fight. It would be simpler to just give in, let his eyes close, and allow himself to slip away.</p><p>So that’s what he did.</p><p>Just before the endless darkness took hold of Lyle and swept him away forever, he heard a pair of voices speak a single word.</p><p>“Good...”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Is it dead?” Dean asked.</p><p>“How should I know?” Sam said.</p><p>“Check it.”</p><p><em>“You</em> check it!”</p><p>Dean had pumped every round his shotgun held into that damned dog, and Sam had emptied his Beretta’s clip, reloaded, and continued firing. Frankenmutt was down, finally, but neither of the brothers was sure it was permanent. During his years as a hunter Dean had encountered a lot of supernatural entities that were hard to kill, but he’d rarely run into anything as tough as this patchwork pooch. Frankenmutt lay on its side, its flesh a savaged, bloody ruin from all the damage it had taken. Dean almost felt sorry for the thing. Almost.</p><p>“Give me a sec.”</p><p>Dean reloaded his weapon, then stepped forward slowly, lowering the barrel until it was pressed against Frankenmutt’s head. He nodded to Sam, who walked over to the monstrous dog and prodded its belly with his foot. When the creature didn’t react, he prodded it harder. Still no response.</p><p>“Doesn’t look like it’s breathing,” Sam said.</p><p>“Since when does that matter in our line of work?”</p><p>“True.” Sam leveled his Beretta and put another round in the beast’s side. Its body bucked with the impact, but otherwise it didn’t move.</p><p>“I’m voting for dead,” Dean said.</p><p>“I’m good with that.”</p><p>Dean removed the shotgun from the creature’s head and waited while Sam retrieved the doll and his phone. Sam tucked the doll under his arm and turned off the crying baby sound effect on his phone, tucked the device into a pocket, and returned. The two of them then crouched down to examine the patchwork dog’s corpse. As ugly as the thing was, Dean expected it to smell like something that you’d find at the bottom of a slaughterhouse Dumpster, but it just smelled like a normal dog. He sniffed. Make that a normal dog covered in blood.</p><p>“The sections all look like parts of regular dogs,” Sam said. “Except for the face. That’s pretty messed up.” He trailed a finger along the line of hairless tissue between the dog’s right front leg and its shoulder. Similar lines crisscrossed the beast’s body.</p><p>“Doesn’t look much like scar tissue, does it?” Dean said.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Doesn’t feel like it, either. It’s kind of... spongy.”</p><p>A line of the strange flesh circled Frankenmutt’s neck, and Dean reached out and touched it. It was firmer than normal skin, and when he pressed it in, it remained that way for a moment before slowly returning to its previous shape. <em>Weird.</em></p><p>“I see what you mean. It’s almost like some kind of... I don’t know, glue or something.”</p><p>“I was thinking the same thing.”</p><p>Dean straightened, and the brothers regarded the body of the monster dog in silence for a time.</p><p>After a while, Sam asked, “Which end do you want?”</p><p>Dean considered for a moment. “Man, there’s no good choice here, is there?” He took another look at the creature’s distorted face and sighed. “I never thought I’d be saying this about an animal, but I’ll take the ass. Try not to get too much blood on you.”</p><p>They each took an end, lifted, and began carrying Frankenmutt out of the woods. Halfway back to the car, Sam stopped and turned his head sharply to the left.</p><p>Dean tensed, senses on high alert, ready for another attack. He looked in the same direction as Sam, but couldn’t see anything but trees and underbrush.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked.</p><p>Sam didn’t answer right away. He squinted, as if he were having a hard time focusing his eyes on whatever he was looking at. Finally, he shook his head as if attempting to clear it.</p><p>“For a minute, I thought... Never mind. It’s nothing. Let’s go. Frankenmutt’s not getting any lighter.”</p><p>The brothers continued lugging the dead dog, Dean unable to decide what bothered him more: that Sam’s arms were trembling with the effort of carrying his half of the creature—Frankenmutt was a big boy, but he wasn’t <em>that</em> heavy, not with the two of them sharing the load—or that it looked like his hallucinations were getting worse.</p><p><em>Just once, it would be nice if a hunt went down easy,</em> he thought. <em>We stroll into town, find the Nasty Whatzit, walk up to it, gank it, and stroll on out. No muss, no fuss.</em></p><p><em>Yeah, right. And maybe vampires would quit sucking blood and start chugging energy drinks instead.</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>He saw me.</p><p>Daniel wasn’t sure how that was possible. The living couldn’t see his kind, not even if he wanted them to. But the younger brother had stared right at him. Daniel had felt the youth’s gaze bore into him. For the first time in all his long existence as a Reaper, he’d felt exposed, and he’d slipped behind an ash tree to conceal himself. He’d felt absurd, hiding like that, as if he were... well, mortal.</p><p>But once the shaggy-haired youth went back to helping his brother cart the corpse of the dead dog-thing away, Daniel caught the whiff of death coming off him, and realized what must have happened. He waited until they were out of sight, and then followed after them, careful not to make too much noise. Again, he felt ridiculous taking such precautions, but he had no idea how sharp the youth’s death-perception had become, and he wasn’t going to take any chances.</p><p>He found what he was looking for almost right away. The dog-thing’s bullet-ravaged corpse had left a trail of blood drops in the brothers’ wake, but he wasn’t interested in those. It was the other trail that caught his attention. A thin wavering black line hovered an inch above the ground, thready and faint, like ink released in water. Daniel knelt to get a closer look at it. It was fading quickly, and he touched his index finger to a section of the shadow-line before it dissipated. He brought his fingertip, now smeared with a soot-like smudge, up to his nose. He sniffed a couple times before inserting his finger into his mouth. When he withdrew his finger a moment later, the tip was clean.</p><p>He was now certain what had happened to the younger brother, and it wasn’t good. At least, not for the boy. But as for Daniel... he might be able to make this work in his favor.</p><p>He stood and continued following the brothers, amending his plans to take this unforeseen, but not entirely unwelcome, development into account.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Peter Martinez sat in front of his office computer monitor staring at rows of data displayed on the screen. He wasn’t reviewing the information, at least not in the usual way. He’d purposely unfocused his gaze to the point where the numbers were blurry, and then he tried to relax and allow his mind to wander. He knew this data forward and backward, and he’d tried analyzing it using every logical method he could think of, without success. So today he’d decided to try a more creative approach. Instead of tackling the problem in a linear fashion, he was going to try turning his subconscious loose on it. As much as scientific advances were a result of step-by-step processes, they also were born in sudden unexpected bursts of insight, the fabled and often sought after Eureka! moment. Today Peter hoped to cultivate a moment of his own.</p><p>His office wasn’t very large, nor was it impressive. If it hadn’t been for the nameplate affixed to the wall outside, no one would have guessed that this was the office of the CEO and Head of Development for NuFlesh Biotech. Though considering that his office was located in a strip mall between a sub shop and a license bureau, and that the business had a total of five employees, including himself, he didn’t see much point in putting on airs. He wore a long-sleeved red pullover and jeans, a step below corporate casual, which was fine as far as he was concerned. He was a scientist, not a stockbroker. He wore a full black beard, partially because he thought it made him look more intelligent—and a bit roguish—but mostly to hide the burn scars that covered the lower right half of his face. He did all his “paperwork” virtually, and aside from the computer, the top of his desk was empty. He had a few books on the shelf behind him, none of which he’d touched in who knew how long. His doctoral diploma hung on one wall, while on the opposite was a framed poster—a large black-and-white photo of Einstein sticking his tongue out. The poster was supposed to remind Peter not to take everything so seriously, but today the sight of it only pissed him off. He couldn’t afford to let the stress get to him. Not if he wanted to create the optimal conditions for a subconscious breakthrough. And he badly needed one.</p><p>Two years, seven months, eight days. That was how long he’d been struggling to solve this particular problem, and at this point, he was willing to try almost anything. The financial state of his company wasn’t exactly “robust,” as the corporate types would put it, and if he didn’t make some progress on the new formula soon... He thrust the thought from his mind. Worrying about money was no way to relax. He gazed at the screen and allowed his breathing to become slow and even, and before long he felt his body relax against his office chair. That’s when it kicked in.</p><p>The Itch.</p><p>It began on his right shoulder blade, little more than the sensation of a feather brushing against his skin. He could ignore that. But it soon spread across his entire back, his chest, down his right arm, up his neck and across the right side of his face, building in intensity until it felt as if a thousand ants were crawling over his skin. That he <em>couldn’t</em> ignore.</p><p>“Don’t scratch,” he whispered. He gripped the armrests of his chair tight, fingers digging into the padding. He knew from long, painful experience that not only didn’t scratching make the itch go away, once he got started, he wouldn’t be able to stop until he’d clawed bloody runnels in his flesh. Even then the itching would continue.</p><p>Peter knew it was common for burn victims to experience discomfort like his, even long after their burns had healed and scar tissue formed. In his case, that had been almost three decades before. He’d gotten his scars as a result of a house fire caused by his idiot of a stepfather falling asleep on the couch one night while smoking. Peter and his mother got out of the house in time, but his stepfather hadn’t made it. His mother hadn’t lasted long, either. She’d died en route to the hospital, not from her burns—severe as they were—but from a heart attack. Peter had only been eleven at the time. Even though twenty-seven years and more operations than he cared to think about had passed since then, the Itch, when it came, was as bad as ever.</p><p>The many doctors and specialists he’d seen over the years had prescribed a variety of remedies for the Itch: topical lotions to stretch and loosen the scar tissue, hypoallergenic lotions, anti-itch creams like hydrocortisone, and analgesic creams such as lidocaine. None of them worked except lidocaine, and even that only managed to take the edge off the Itch. There was only one treatment he’d ever found that provided relief, and he’d used up the last of it a couple days before. He’d tried contacting his supplier, but so far the man hadn’t responded to any of his voicemails or texts. If he didn’t get in touch soon, Peter didn’t know what he was going to—</p><p>His desk phone rang, and the sound made him jump. He snatched the receiver off the hook and answered the call, speaking through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Damn it, Allison! I <em>told</em> you I didn’t want—“</p><p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Martinez. I know you asked me not to disturb you, but Mr. Dippel is here, and I thought—“</p><p>“Send him in.” He hung up without saying goodbye.</p><p>He didn’t like being brusque with his office assistant, but he couldn’t help it. When the Itch was upon him like this, it took everything he had not to scream. He remembered one of his doctors telling him that while he was certain the itching was real, it couldn’t possibly be as intense as Peter reported.</p><p><em>I’m confident there’s a somatic component at work here,</em> the doctor had said.</p><p>Peter wasn’t an MD, but he was a biochemist, and he’d known damn well what the doctor had <em>really</em> meant. <em>Psychosomatic.</em> Unlike most people, Peter knew that psychosomatic sensations were real, but they were caused by mental processes rather than disease or injury. The simplest example was the stomach pain some people experienced before a stressful event, such as an important exam or presentation at work. The pain was real, the physical processes that caused it were real, but it was triggered by stress. Peter’s understanding of what the doctor had said didn’t mean he agreed with it, though.</p><p><em>There’s a strong correlation between people who experience somatic pain and those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder. The fire you survived...</em></p><p>Peter shoved the memory away.</p><p>With every fiber of his being, all the way down to the subatomic level, he was certain that the Itch was solely the result of the terrible injuries he’d suffered as a child, and not related to his emotional state in any way, shape, or form.</p><p>Normally he would have gone into the outer office to greet Dippel, but he feared that if he took his hands off the chair’s armrests, he’d start digging his fingernails into his skin and wouldn’t be able to stop. So he sat and gripped his chair even tighter and waited. A moment later there was a soft knock at the door. Peter tried to say, <em>Come in,</em> but the words came out as a pained grunting. They were enough to get the message across, though. The door opened and Conrad entered.</p><p>“Hello, Peter. As always, it’s good to see you. Please, don’t get up. I can see that you’re... concentrating.” Conrad gave him a thin smile as he took a seat in the chair in front of Peter’s desk.</p><p>Peter was struck anew by the strength of Conrad’s presence. Whenever the man was in the room, everything seemed to gravitate toward him. People’s attention, for one thing. It was hard as hell to take your eyes off him. It took an effort even to blink. But it was more than that. The air flowed toward him, leaving the rest of the room hot and stuffy, and he drew in light as well, illuminating himself more brightly while deepening the shadows everywhere else. It was as if he exerted his own manner of gravitational pull, one that was somehow more psychic in nature than physical. It was a ridiculous idea, Peter knew—he was a scientist, for God’s sake!—but it was one he couldn’t shake.</p><p>As always, Conrad wore a suit and tie, making him look more like a business owner than Peter. If it was possible, the man appeared even more cadaverous than the last time Peter had seen him, and not for the first time he wondered if Conrad was battling some sort of disease, cancer maybe. But despite his appearance, the man always seemed to be alert and filled with energy. After nearly thirty years of having people look at his own burn scars first before noticing there was a human being attached to them—if indeed they ever noticed—Peter certainly knew better than to judge by appearances. One thing he liked about Conrad, in fact, was that the man never seemed bothered by his scars. It wasn’t that he was able to put aside his disgust, which was what most people who considered themselves enlightened did. Conrad was well aware of Peter’s scars, but he wasn’t repulsed by them. He always met Peter’s gaze, and never averted his eyes. Peter even occasionally had the uneasy feeling that Conrad <em>liked</em> looking at his scars.</p><p>“I’m sorry that I haven’t returned your messages,” Conrad continued. “I’ve been especially busy of late. I had hoped to find you in good health, but regrettably, I see that isn’t the case. I take it that your supply of my special unguent has been expended?”</p><p><em>You know damn well it has, you bastard! I left you enough messages saying so!</em></p><p>Out loud, Peter simply said, “Yes.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Then it is indeed fortuitous that I stopped in for a visit today.”</p><p>He reached into the inner breast pocket of his jacket and removed a glass vial with an old-fashioned cork stopper. The contents was a pale green-tinged yellow, an unappealing color, but Peter didn’t care what it looked like. He only cared that it worked.</p><p>Conrad placed the vial on the desk top, but when Peter tried to grab it, he snatched it away.</p><p>“My usual fee?” he asked.</p><p><em>Yes, yes, YES!</em> Peter nodded.</p><p>Satisfied, Conrad handed over the vial. Peter snatched it from him, pulled the cork out with his teeth, and spat it onto the desk. Then, without a scrap of self-consciousness, he stood, pulled off his shirt, and threw it to the floor. Reddish scar tissue covered the right side of his body from the lower half of his face, down to his mid-abdomen, including three-quarters of his right arm, as well as his right shoulder and shoulder blade. The air should have felt good on his exposed skin, but all it did was intensify the Itch, which had already reached maddening levels. Peter dumped some of the thick oily unguent into his palm and began smearing it on, moving as fast as he could.</p><p>“Not too much,” Conrad cautioned. “A little goes a long way.”</p><p>Peter ignored him and kept slathering it onto his body. Relief was almost instantaneous. A cool tingling sensation began to spread across his scarred flesh, the Itch receding in its wake. He let out a sigh and collapsed back into his chair, not caring if he smeared any of the goop on the fabric. He must look a sight, shirtless, scar tissue glistening with a sheen of oily yellow-green gunk, but he didn’t care. All that mattered was the Itch was gone.</p><p>“Thank you,” he said.</p><p>Conrad acknowledged Peter’s gratitude with a slow nod.</p><p>“I know I’ve said it before, but I wish you’d give me the formula for this stuff. I’d pay any price for it.”</p><p>“I do not wish to be insulting, but given the current state of your business, such an offer can only be hyperbole.”</p><p>Peter <em>was</em> insulted, but he knew he couldn’t argue the point. He’d developed NuFlesh—the product, not the business he’d named for it—for people like him. NuFlesh was artificial skin that paramedics could use as a temporary wound patch until they could get an accident victim to the hospital. In that regard, it was successful. It did indeed seal off wounds and burns, keeping them protected and free of infection. Unfortunately, it tended to decay after an hour, two at the most, and tests had suggested it might be toxic, making long-term use impossible. So even if Peter managed to solve the decay problem—which was his current focus—he would then have to turn his attention to the toxicity issue. All of this added up to a sad bottom line for NuFlesh Biotech, and he and his employees were far from rolling in money. It was the major reason he’d located his business in Brennan. Office space was cheap. If he could make his artificial skin work, he’d change the world of medicine forever—and get stinking rich into the bargain. But that, as the saying goes, was a mighty big <em>if.</em></p><p>“Besides, even if I gave you the formula, I doubt you’d be able to replicate it successfully,” Conrad said, then smiled. “After all, it isn’t as if you haven’t already made the attempt, hmm?”</p><p>Peter could feel himself flush with embarrassment. It was true. He’d attempted to analyze the chemical unguent on several occasions, and while he’d been able to determine the ingredients and their proportions easily enough, he couldn’t make the damned stuff work, no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>“You’ve told me the unguent is an ancient formula once used by the Egyptians to protect their skin from dry heat.”</p><p>“My own variation on that formula, but essentially, yes,” Conrad confirmed.</p><p>Peter forced a smile. “Let me guess: the reason I can’t recreate it is that I lack the magic touch.”</p><p>Conrad’s smile widened. “Precisely.”</p><p>Peter scowled. He hated it when he had the feeling that Conrad was toying with him.</p><p>The man had approached him a few months before, saying that he’d read about NuFlesh on the company’s website and was intrigued by its promise. He’d wanted to purchase fifty pounds of the stuff for his own unspecified research needs. Peter’s patent on the most recent version of the NuFlesh formula was still pending, and he was reluctant at first to allow someone who might be a potential competitor to have that much of the material. Then, when Conrad had told him he had a treatment that would relieve Peter’s periodic itching—although how the man had known about that, Peter had no idea—he’d been skeptical. But Conrad had delivered, and Peter had been only too happy to let him have his pound of artificial flesh, times fifty, in exchange. Since then, Conrad, who’d always presented himself as something of an old-world gentleman, had become increasingly snide and even cruel at times, and Peter would have been happy to sever their relationship... if he hadn’t needed Conrad’s mysterious unguent so damned bad.</p><p>“Honestly, I don’t know what you’re doing with all the NuFlesh you’ve... I guess purchased isn’t the right word. Bartered, I suppose. You know it’s unstable and potentially toxic to boot.”</p><p>“It suits my current needs as is,” Conrad said. “And I can, as people say these days, work around those problems.”</p><p>Peter burned with curiosity. No matter how many times he tried to pry details out of Conrad about what he wanted NuFlesh for, the man never gave away anything. He wondered if Conrad had found a way to solve the decay and toxicity issues. He had no idea what the man’s educational and professional backgrounds were—again, Conrad had resisted his attempts to find out—but he gave the impression that he was well acquainted with the sciences, especially chemistry. The unguent was proof of that. Maybe if he offered Conrad a job? Not that he had any money to pay him. But if he made him a partner...</p><p>“I’d like a hundred pounds this time,” Conrad said. “If at all possible.”</p><p>Peter unconsciously rubbed the scar tissue beneath his beard as he thought. His fingers came away sticky with unguent. “That’s just about all I have on hand at the moment. It takes a while to manufacture, you know, and there are experiments scheduled...”</p><p>Conrad once again reached into his inner jacket pocket, removed a second stoppered vial, and placed it on the desk.</p><p>Peter looked upon it with an addict’s hungry gaze.</p><p>“You have a deal.”</p><p>As he reached for it, Conrad grabbed his hand and stopped him. It was the first time the man had touched him, and Peter was surprised by how cold his flesh was.</p><p>“A warning. My unguent comes with certain... side effects if used too frequently and in large amounts. It is why I have made sure to parcel it out rather than give you too much at one time. Take care not to use it more than once every two days. Three would be preferable. You must heed my instructions, regardless of how intense your itching may become. Do you understand?”</p><p>“Sure. Whatever you say.”</p><p>Conrad looked deep into his eyes, as if trying to gauge his sincerity, before finally releasing his hand. Peter grabbed the second vial and held it close to his face. The yellow-green contents resembled bottled mucus, but right now it was one of the most beautiful sights he’d ever seen.</p><p><em>Screw you, Itch,</em> he thought.</p><p>Although it might have been his imagination, he could’ve sworn he felt a slight momentary irritation behind his right ear, as if the Itch was saying, <em>Don’t worry. I’ll be back</em>—<em>soon. And then we’ll</em> really <em>have some fun!</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>A short time later, Conrad drove away from the strip mall, ninety pounds of NuFlesh on the back seat of his black SUV, sealed in airtight plastic and packed in unmarked cardboard boxes. It was less than he wanted, but it was all Peter had, so it would have to do. Peter promised to call him when he had more made, and considering how badly the man needed his unguent, Conrad had no doubt he’d make good on his promise.</p><p>NuFlesh was amazing material, and although Conrad had no idea if Peter would ever perfect it, it didn’t matter as far as his purpose was concerned. As he’d told the man, the current NuFlesh formula was sufficient for his needs—as long as he added a few alchemical touches of his own.</p><p>There was much that Conrad didn’t like about the modern world—for the most part the people were unrefined and ill-mannered, and they seemed incapable of concentrating on a single task for any length of time—but he found the Internet exceedingly useful. He’d been fortunate to discover the NuFlesh website one evening while doing research, and had been filled with excitement, hoping that at last he’d found the answer he’d been searching so long for. The material had worked better than he’d dared dream, and now, after three long centuries, he was finally on the verge of seeing his vision made reality.</p><p>“Praise Hel,” he whispered.</p><p>In addition to the NuFlesh, there were two metal coolers in the storage area behind the SUV’s back seat. In each of them, packed in ice and wrapped in strips of cloth soaked in an alchemical mixture of his own devising, were the other supplies Catherine needed. She’d given him a list, and he’d gone out last night and done his best to procure all the items on it. Unfortunately, the two homeless men that he’d chosen as donors hadn’t been in the best of health—he’d seen evidence of cancer in one man’s lungs in addition to an enlarged heart, and he’d found cirrhosis in the other’s liver along with a surprisingly large tumor in the brain. He’d been forced to leave the affected organs behind, for even with the skilled application of NuFlesh, they would be useless. But he’d managed to obtain most of the items Catherine desired, and he thought she would be pleased. If she needed anything more, he could always go out again that night. Not only was he highly practiced at procurement, no matter how many centuries he’d done it, the work never got old for him.</p><p><em>It’s the simple pleasures,</em> he thought, and smiled.</p><p>He felt a sudden vibration in his front pants pocket that startled him. He removed one hand from the steering wheel, reached into his pocket, and pulled out his cell phone. As always, he thought he’d never get used to the damnable contraptions. He looked at the screen display, saw Catherine’s name, and answered it.</p><p>“Hello, Catherine. It’s quite a coincidence that you called. Even as we speak, I am on my way to your home to deliver—“</p><p>She cut him off, something a well-bred woman would never have done in his day. “Have you seen today’s paper?” she demanded.</p><p>At first he thought the bodies of the two homeless men had been discovered, and she was upset. But he dismissed that possibility at once. In all the time they’d been “collaborating,” she had never directly addressed the issue of where he came by the raw material he brought her, even though he knew it made her uncomfortable. No, it had to be something else.</p><p>“Has the dog struck again? Do not concern yourself. After I have brought your supplies, I will go in search of the beast and—“</p><p>“It’s not the damned dog! It’s something else.”</p><p>She’d done it again! If he didn’t need the woman’s medical skills so badly... Her words sank in then.</p><p>“Something... else?”</p><p>She proceeded to tell him.</p><h2><span id="chapter-7">CHAPTER 7</span><a href="#chapter-7" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“What’s the name of this place we’re looking for again?” Dean asked.</p><p>“NuFlesh Biotech.”</p><p>They were driving through downtown Brennan, after a stop back at the motel to do a little research, scarf down some fast-food takeout, and change into their suits. Dean had eaten a half-pound bacon cheeseburger with everything on it—and extra bacon, of course—along with a large order of fries. Now the food was lying in his stomach like a lead brick, and he was beginning to wish he’d gone Sam’s route and had a salad. Although he would never admit that to his brother. If he did, he knew Sam would see that as an opportunity to convert him to the Cult of Good Nutrition, and he’d never hear the end of it.</p><p>“NuFlesh. That sound ominous to you?”</p><p>“Only a lot,” Sam said. He took a sip of his extra-large coffee. They’d stopped on the way to pick it up, and he’d ordered it black this time, with two shots of espresso.</p><p>Dean was frustrated. Despite the fact that Sam had convinced him that dealing with Frankenmutt might lead them to some kind of new weapon they could use against Dick Roman, the longer they spent in Brennan, the more antsy he was becoming. Roman and the other Leviathan were out there, stuffing their fanged faces with human flesh while continuing to advance their plans for world conquest, and the shape-shifting sons of bitches weren’t about to put their program on hold while the Winchester brothers tended to other business. The Leviathan were like a deadly disease that would continue to spread unchecked unless something was done about it, and hanging around this podunk town ganking freakshow dogs wasn’t doing anything to stop them.</p><p>It didn’t help that Sam seemed to be even fewer fries short of a Happy Meal than usual. Dean was certain his brother had experienced some sort of hallucination in the woods that he didn’t want to talk about, and he was guzzling coffee like it was water and he was a man crossing the Sahara on foot. Dean was no stranger to the concept of self-medicating, but he wasn’t sure what Sam hoped to accomplish by loading up on caffeine. It seemed to him that all that stimulation would only make Sam jittery and anxious, which in turn would make it harder for him to keep control of his mental state. Then again, Dean preferred “medicine” that took the edge off rather than sharpened it, so maybe it was simply a matter of to each his own. Still, he was determined to keep an eye on Sam which, he had to admit to himself, was pretty much what he normally did. So in a way, when it came to the Winchesters’ screwed up lives, he supposed everything was more or less normal.</p><p>It didn’t help his mood that Frankenmutt’s corpse was starting to stink up the crapmobile big-time. The monster dog was in the trunk, wrapped in a couple motel towels, but its stink had filtered through the car’s interior, and was making his already queasy stomach worse.</p><p><em>Definitely a salad next time,</em> he thought. <em>Maybe a taco salad, with extra meat, salsa, and sour cream.</em></p><p>“I like it better when the things we kill disintegrate when they die,” he said. “Less mess to deal with.”</p><p>“Definitely less stink,” Sam agreed. “I’m not sure, but I think Frankenmutt’s decaying faster than normal. Which only makes sense if it was made out of parts of already dead dogs. Once it’s dead—or dead again, I guess—whatever force was arresting the decomposition process is gone, and so—“</p><p>“It’s bye-bye Frankenmutt, hello nasty pile of rotting meat.”</p><p>“Pretty much. I just hope there’s enough left by the time we get to NuFlesh.”</p><p>“You really think the guy that owns the place can help us?”</p><p>“I don’t know. But you saw the pictures on their site. The kind of stuff they make looks an awful lot like those weird scar lines on Frankenmutt.”</p><p>When they had returned to the motel room, Sam had gotten on the Internet and worked his tech geek mojo until he found the NuFlesh website. It had taken him a while, which surprised Dean. Usually Sam could find information on the net as easily as Dean could find beef jerky on a convenience store shelf, but considering Sam’s starting point was little more than the search term “weird scars,” he supposed it was impressive that he’d come up with anything at all.</p><p>NuFlesh was in the business of making artificial skin that, according to the website, had “profound medical applications that could eventually change the world.” From what Dean had seen, though, they still had quite a way to go before they could fulfill that promise. The stuff looked more like flesh-colored rubber than actual skin, and when it was applied to a person, it looked far less natural than skin grafts did. Sam had also discovered—buried deep in the site so that it wouldn’t be obvious to the casual browser—that the success record of NuFlesh was, to put it kindly, modest. It didn’t sound to Dean like the stuff worked well enough to patch a paper cut, let alone hold together a bunch of dead doggy parts. But he had to admit, it did look kind of like Frankenmutt’s scars, so he supposed talking to NuFlesh’s creator was worth a shot. With any luck, he’d turn out to be the Dr. Frankenstein they were looking for, and they could get the hunt over with and get back to what really mattered: taking down Dick Roman and his army of oversized piranha.</p><p>“Speaking of Frankenmutt, how’s that bite doing?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam took another sip of his hi-test coffee. “Good. Still no sign of infection.” He crossed his legs and pulled up the cuff of his jeans to show Dean where he’d been bitten. True to his word, the skin there looked healthy. The bite marks were scabbed over, and there was no swelling or reddening, not even any bruising. Dean found the latter a bit odd. Frankenmutt wouldn’t have won any beauty contests when he was alive, but he’d been at least as strong as an ordinary dog, if not stronger. The pressure of his bite should have left some kind of mark on Sam to accompany the puncture wounds caused by his teeth, but there was nothing. Maybe Dean had overestimated the monster dog’s strength—or maybe not. It was one more thing to keep his eye on.</p><p>It didn’t take them long to find NuFlesh Biotech. Dean was surprised to discover the business was located in a strip mall.</p><p>“It’s not exactly what I expected,” he said.</p><p>“What did you think we’d find? A rundown castle with a giant lightning rod jutting from one of the towers and a hunchbacked assistant lurking behind a parapet?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “No, but I figured it would look more... I don’t know, sciencey.”</p><p>He pulled the car into a space in front of NuFlesh and parked.</p><p>“It <em>is</em> a start-up company,” Sam pointed out. “This is probably the best location they can afford.”</p><p>Dean shut off the ignition. He grimaced as the car’s engine juddered and knocked a couple times before cutting out. God, he missed the Impala!</p><p><em>We’ll be together again, baby,</em> he thought. <em>Soon as Daddy kills Dick Roman.</em></p><p>“Maybe so,” Dean said, “but it doesn’t have any style. It looks more like a dry cleaner’s than the lair of an evil genius.”</p><p>“We don’t have any proof yet that Dr. Martinez had anything to do with Frankenmutt. And even if he did, why would he want to advertise that he’s Brennan’s version of Dr. Frankenstein? Look at the Leviathan. They might be ancient creatures from the dawn of creation, but they adapted to the modern world right away. They blend in. Maybe that’s what Martinez is doing.”</p><p>“That’s another thing. Martinez—it’s not a good mad doctor name. Frankenstein, Jekyll, Moreau, Phibes. Those are creepy names. Martinez, not so much.”</p><p>They got out of the car. Sam finished off his coffee and tossed the empty cup into a trash receptacle on the sidewalk in front of NuFlesh. As they walked toward NuFlesh’s front door, Dean could smell that they’d both been perfumed with <em>eau de Frankenmutt.</em> He figured they’d need to get their suits dry cleaned after this was over. For a brief moment, he was grateful that they weren’t driving the Impala. He’d have hated his baby getting all funked up with dead monster dog stink.</p><p>Inside the small reception area, it quickly became clear they smelled worse than Dean feared. The office assistant—a bird-thin woman in her fifties with braided white hair—pursed her lips and turned her head slightly to the side as she spoke with them in a futile attempt to keep her nose as far away from their stench as possible. They showed her their fake bureau IDs, she made a quick call, and a moment later a side door opened and Dr. Peter Martinez came striding out.</p><p><em>Now that’s more like it,</em> Dean thought, and was instantly ashamed of himself. The man had obviously suffered serious burn injuries sometime in the past.</p><p>Dean knew better than to judge anyone based on their appearance. At least anyone human. When it came to supernatural predators, however, most of the time you really could judge a book by its cover. If something looked like it wanted to eat your flesh or devour your soul, it probably did.</p><p>Even though Dean knew better, he couldn’t help thinking that Martinez’s burn scars made him look like a perfect evil scientist. Of course, his clothes could use some work. A flannel shirt, jeans, and running shoes didn’t scream <em>I’m a guy who stitches together pieces of dead people in my lab!</em> Maybe if he added a white coat with a few bloodstains on it...</p><p>“I’m Dr. Martinez.” He smiled, the unscarred corner of his mouth rising higher than the other. He shook Dean’s hand, then Sam’s. “How can I help you gentlemen?”</p><p>Dean found himself staring at the man’s burn-scarred flesh. He’d seen plenty of scars in his time—hell, he had more than a few of his own, as did Sam—and he wasn’t normally put off by them, but now that Martinez stood only a couple feet from them, Dean could see that there was something not quite right about his. They were moist and glistening, as if coated with petroleum jelly, and the flesh sagged. The whole effect made Martinez look as if he were a wax figure that was in the process of slowly melting.</p><p>Dean glanced at Sam, and could tell by his brother’s expression that he found the man’s strange scars equally disturbing. More telling than that, though, was the office manager’s reaction. When Martinez had first appeared, she’d gasped, and now her eyes were wide, as if she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. Whatever was going on with Martinez’s scars, it wasn’t normal.</p><p>Dean revised his earlier judgment. Dr. Martinez was definitely a candidate for Brennan’s local mad scientist.</p><p>Sam started to introduce them, but halfway through he broke into a huge yawn.</p><p>“Sorry,” he mumbled. “Late night on the job.”</p><p>Dean shot him a look. “As my partner was saying, we’ve been called in to help with the investigation into the strange deaths that have occurred here in town over the last few days. We think you might be able to help.”</p><p>Dean watched Martinez closely for any reaction to the mention of the wasting deaths that he’d come to think of as The Pruning, but the man appeared to have none beyond puzzlement.</p><p>“I’m a biochemist, not a disease specialist. I’m not sure I can be of much use to you.”</p><p>“We think the deaths might have a link to NuFlesh,” Sam said. “Not the company itself so much as your product.”</p><p>Martinez frowned. “I don’t see how that’s possible. Not only doesn’t NuFlesh create any kind of side effects that could account for those deaths, the product’s still in the development stage and isn’t in wide use in the public sector. In fact, I don’t know of anyone in town that has a NuFlesh graft.”</p><p>The man reached up to scratch at the sagging scarred flesh on the side of his face in what looked to Dean like a nervous habit. His fingernails opened thin runnels in the puckered skin that immediately filled with a yellowish fluid, but he didn’t seem to notice. Dean’s stomach did a flip.</p><p><em>Salad. Next time, for sure.</em></p><p>“We’ve got something we’d like you to look at,” Sam said. “It’ll only take a moment of your time, and we’d really appreciate it.”</p><p>Sam kept his gaze fastened on Martinez’s eyes, and Dean knew his brother was trying not to stare at the fluid-filled lines the man had carved into his face.</p><p>“Of course. Glad to help.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Sam said. “It’s outside.”</p><p>As the three of them left the office, Dean saw that the office manager had gone pale. Between enduring the stink of Frankenmutt’s corpse that clung to them and seeing her boss mutilate himself, she looked like she too was regretting whatever she’d chosen to have for lunch.</p><p>Dean’s stomach gurgled. <em>I know just how you feel, sister,</em> he thought.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam would have killed for another coffee right then, maybe with three shots of espresso this time. He was having a hell of a time keeping his eyes open, and he was beginning to think that it was more than simple weariness. Maybe it was his body’s reaction to having to struggle against the madness that roiled within him. Fighting the crazy took a lot out of him, and it was only natural that it took a toll on his energy levels. He wondered how much longer he could keep going like this before his system had had enough and went into full shutdown. Maybe instead of just crashing in some motel room for a few hours, he’d slip into a deep slumber from which he’d never awaken. He was surprised to find that the thought didn’t scare him. It was actually kind of comforting, in a weird way. He’d read about very old people who looked forward to dying, seeing it as a chance to lay down the burdens they’d carried for so long and finally rest. Given everything that had happened to him already in his relatively young life, he understood that attitude better than most people his age, but he never thought he’d end up feeling that way himself. <em>Getting a little too morbid,</em> he told himself. Best antidote for that was to concentrate on the job at hand.</p><p>One good thing: at least he hadn’t hallucinated Dr. Martinez’s oozing, sagging scar tissue. He could tell from Dean’s reaction that he’d seen and was disturbed by it, too. So, that was a relief. Sam had no idea what could cause the man’s scar tissue to ooze like that. As far as he knew, old scars didn’t suppurate. He wondered if Martinez had tried using his formula for NuFlesh to repair his face. Though he had said that the product was still in development. If that was the case, then maybe the weird scar lines on Frankenmutt had nothing to do with NuFlesh, which would mean that he and Dean were, to coin a pun, barking up the wrong tree.</p><p>They reached the car and Dean opened the trunk.</p><p>“This is the best the bureau can afford?” Martinez said as he eyed the ancient vehicle.</p><p>“Budget cutbacks,” Dean said without missing a beat. “You know how it is.”</p><p>A truly horrendous stench wafted from the trunk’s interior, causing all three of them to take a step backward. Sam was grateful it was November. He didn’t want to think about how bad Frankenmutt would have smelled if it had been August.</p><p>“What in the hell <em>is</em> that?” Martinez said, hand clamped over the lower half of his face in what Sam knew was a futile attempt to block out the stink.</p><p>“You tell us.” Dean threw back the top of the blanket covering Frankenmutt and exposed the creature’s ravaged corpse.</p><p>Dr. Martinez stared at the beast, but Sam and Dean kept their gazes focused on him. They were looking for some sign of recognition in the man’s eyes, but all Sam saw in his expression was disgust. Either the man was a damn good actor, or he had never seen Frankenmutt before. Then his disgust turned to confusion and then curiosity. He lowered his hand from his face and stepped forward to get a closer look.</p><p>“Is this a <em>dog?”</em></p><p>“From the looks of it, more like several,” Dean said.</p><p>Martinez leaned even closer, and Sam was impressed that he could do so without gagging. He reached into his shirt pocket and withdrew a pen. Using it as a probe, he touched the tip to the fleshy line dividing Frankenmutt’s rear leg from his body.</p><p>“I see now why you wanted to consult me. This material resembles NuFlesh.”</p><p>“Resembles?” Sam said.</p><p>Martinez continued poking at Frankenmutt with his pen. “The color and texture are both somewhat different. It’s more pliable than NuFlesh, more like the actual skin.”</p><p>“But it <em>is</em> artificial,” Sam pressed.</p><p>“Undoubtedly.” Martinez gave him a quick lopsided smile. “Whatever this thing is, I think it’s safe to say it wasn’t born this way.”</p><p>Dean gave Sam an exasperated look.</p><p>Undaunted, Sam continued. “Assuming that this... animal is what it appears to be, could NuFlesh—or something like it—be used to join the separate parts together?”</p><p>“Like some kind of meat glue,” Dean added.</p><p>Martinez straightened and stepped back away from the trunk. Sam noticed he didn’t return his pen to his pocket. Sam didn’t blame him.</p><p>“Are you serious?”</p><p>“Humor those of us without PhDs in biochemistry,” Dean said.</p><p>Martinez thought for a moment. As he did, he scratched at his face again. The scar tissue broke and oozed more fluid, and sagged another fraction of an inch.</p><p>“I designed NuFlesh as an artificial substance for use in skin grafts, though I’ve always thought it could one day be employed in transplants. But that’s only in theory. Such applications are years, maybe even decades, away.” He looked at Frankenmutt again. “Even if someone has managed to develop their own NuFlesh formula that’s more advanced than mine, the hurdles they’d have to overcome to create a thing like this are staggering. Fusing bone, connecting muscles and nerves... Why the problems with tissue rejection alone—“</p><p>“We get the picture,” Dean interrupted. “It’s not exactly the kind of thing you can do with a junior mad scientist kit and a little old-fashioned elbow grease.”</p><p>“Hardly,” Martinez agreed. “I’m confident in saying that no one on Earth has the capability to make an abomination like this. Although why anyone would want to is beyond me. You believe it has some connection to the recent spate of mysterious deaths?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Dean drew the blanket back over Frankenmutt’s corpse and closed the trunk. “We figured people took one look at it, and died from an overdose of ugly.”</p><p>Sam gave Dean a warning look, then turned to Martinez. “There’s no risk of contagion.”</p><p>“I assumed that was the case,” Martinez said, “or else you would’ve observed stricter containment protocols.” He glanced at the closed trunk. “Or any, for that matter. I mean, not even the federal government could be that stupid, right?”</p><p>Sam glanced at Dean, but neither of them said anything.</p><p>“When you find out where that thing came from, please let me know,” Martinez said. “Professional curiosity, you understand. Now, if there’s nothing further, I do have work I should get back to.”</p><p>“One last question,” Dean said. “Could this artificial flesh stuff be used to make a guy with two heads and four arms?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Peter stood on the sidewalk outside his business and watched the agents drive away in their ancient wreck of a car, taking the corpse of the misbegotten creature—and its horrendous stink—with them. After they had gone, he took his phone from his pocket and keyed in Conrad’s number. While he waited for him to answer, he idly scratched his face. The Itch was mild, far better than it had been, but it still bothered him. When he was done speaking with Conrad, he’d go back inside and apply more of the man’s special unguent. True, Conrad had cautioned him against using too much, but it was the only thing that gave Peter any relief. Really, what was the worst that could happen?</p><p>He didn’t feel the viscous fluid that oozed from the furrows he gouged in his scarred flesh, and even if he had, he probably wouldn’t have cared.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The embalming room in the basement of Harrison Brauer’s Legacy Center—in plainer language, a funeral parlor—was cramped and clammy, although he preferred to think of it as cozy and cool. The colorless walls and tiled floor seemed to glow in the stark fluorescent light, and if he spent too much time working down here, his eyes would start to water. If it got really bad, he’d don a pair of sunglasses, making him, at least in his own mind, the hippest mortician in town. The air held an iron tang that he’d long ago gotten used to, and which, truth to tell, he’d come to find rather pleasant. A pair of white marble tables occupied the center of the chamber, and above them a metal showerhead hung from the ceiling, just in case Harrison needed to wash away a particularly nasty spill. Set into the floor between the tables was a large grated drain, which he often thought of as a perfect metaphor for the end of life. Ultimately, everything that lived ended up washed down the Great Drain of the Universe.</p><p>Next to one of the tables was a gurney, and lying face up on it, naked, was Mason McKelvey, owner of McKelvey’s Motorama, Brennan’s most successful used car dealership. He’d been brought in less than an hour before, after spending the last nine days of his life in a hospital bed as his kidneys slowly ceased functioning. A shame, really, as he’d only been in his early sixties; not young, but then again, not all that old, either. Harrison had never bought a car from Mason—the funeral business had treated him well, and he could afford to purchase his vehicles new—but he knew the man from both the rotary club and the town’s merchants’ association. A nice enough fellow, if a bit loud and self-serving. Though as he’d been a salesman, and by all accounts, cold-blooded and ruthless when it came to forging a deal, Harrison figured the man’s jovial obnoxiousness was par for the course. When most people came to him, lying naked and statue-still, they seemed diminished somehow; smaller, sunken in on themselves, skin sallow and hard like wax figures. Mason was no exception. A thin man with a surprisingly thick shock of wild white hair, a sharp nose, and oversized ears, he appeared almost comical despite his current surroundings. Down here in the embalming room, there was nothing about Mason McKelvey to indicate the position of power and respect he’d held in life. Not for the first time, Mason thought that death truly was the great equalizer.</p><p>Harrison certainly understood how surface appearances didn’t always show the person within, for he himself defied the stereotype that most people had of morticians. Instead of looking like Gomez Addams—grim black suit, corpse-white complexion, mad gleam in his eyes—he was tall, ruddy-faced, and rotund, like a clean-shaven Santa Claus. His demeanor matched his appearance. He had a constant smile on his face, and he laughed often and easily, a loud infectious sound that came from deep in his chest, inviting everyone who heard it to join in.</p><p>Harrison shifted Mason from the gurney onto one of the marble tables with an ease born of equal parts strength and long practice. He wheeled the gurney into a corner of the room to get it out of the way, and then returned to consider Mason. The first steps in preparing a client for embalming are simple: scrub the skin, clean the nails, shampoo the hair, and then massage the limbs to break up rigor mortis. Then the mouth is sewn shut and the facial features carefully posed before the body stiffens. After that, the process becomes more involved. The blood is drawn, the stomach emptied, and the body filled with arterial firming fluid, which also gives the skin color. Harrison preferred using Index 32 lithol, which he purchased from a specialist supply company.</p><p>The tools of Harrison’s trade surrounded him: the trocar that emptied out his clients’ stomachs, the scalpels he used to dig into their arteries, the Duotronic pump that injected chemicals into their bodies, causing them to give off a vinegar-like scent. But he didn’t reach for any of these. Instead, he pulled open a drawer and removed a makeup kit. He placed it on the table next to Mason’s head, opened it, and went to work.</p><p>Half an hour later, he was finished. Harrison stepped back to admire the results.</p><p>He had covered Mason’s face, ears, and neck with white, outlined his lips with bright red to create a garish smile, and painted a large black dollar sign over each eye. On the left cheek he’d written the word “Buy” in black, and on the right he’d written “Sell.” He’d combed Mason’s hair up and back, sprayed it so it would remain in place, and then colored it green to represent money.</p><p>He removed a hand mirror from the makeup kit and held it in front of Mason’s new face. “What do you think? You’ve heard of a clown car, right? Well, now you’re a car clown!”</p><p>Harrison laughed, but evidently Mason didn’t get the joke, for he remained silent. <em>Screw him.</em> Harrison thought it was funny.</p><p>He returned the mirror to the kit, walked over to the counter, and picked up his camera. He then spent the next several minutes taking pictures of Mason from different angles.</p><p>“You know you’re just going to have to clean all that off.”</p><p>The voice startled Harrison, but he recognized it almost immediately. Instead of turning to look at the speaker, he continued shooting photos as he answered.</p><p>“I’ll admit that mine is a transitory art, but that’s what makes it so special. I reveal my clients’ inner nature, bring it to the surface for perhaps the first and only time since the day they were born, and then I restore the more familiar appearance their family and friends expect. But for a short interval at least, if only down here with me, they become their truest, most profound selves.”</p><p>Satisfied he’d gotten some good shots for his latest scrapbook—he’d already filled seven others—he lowered his camera and finally turned to face Conrad.</p><p>Conrad stepped forward from the shadowy corner where he’d been standing and approached the table where Mason lay. Harrison didn’t question how Conrad had managed to enter the embalming room without his hearing him. He knew that he became so focused when practicing his art—which he considered his true vocation—that a bomb could go off behind him and he’d barely notice. Besides, Conrad had a way of moving snake-silent when he wanted to.</p><p>Conrad glanced at Mason’s altered face. “I suppose it was his ears and nose that gave you the idea to make him up as a clown.”</p><p>“That, and the awful TV commercials he made for his dealership. He was one of those car salesmen who always talk too loud and fast when they’re on camera, you know?”</p><p>“Death shouldn’t be mocked like this,” Conrad said. “It is sacred.”</p><p>Harrison didn’t attach any mystic or religious significance to death. As far as he was concerned, it was only a biological process, no more important or meaningful than flipping off a light switch when you left a room.</p><p>“To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit?” he asked to change the subject. “Should I assume that you’re in need of the kind of materials that only I can supply?”</p><p>“Thank you, but no. At the moment, I happen to be well stocked.”</p><p>Harrison frowned. “Nothing personal, but I didn’t take you to be the type to make social calls.”</p><p>“I’m not.” Mason’s body lay between them, but now Conrad began slowly walking around the table, approaching Harrison. “Do you remember when I first came to you?”</p><p>“Of course.” How could he forget the day a well-dressed, overly formal man entered his parlor and introduced himself as Conrad Dippel? Conrad—who looked far more like an archetypal mortician than Harrison ever would—had brought with him several containers of a material called NuFlesh and a business proposition.</p><p>“I sought you out for several reasons. One was your profession. It is an ancient and noble one which my lady well regards. Another was your surname: Bauer. It means <em>brewer</em> in German. My lady has always held a fondness for the Germanic people, and I myself am honored to claim that heritage as well.”</p><p>Harrison had heard Conrad speak of his <em>lady</em> before, but he had no idea who he was referring to. Some sort of supervisor, he supposed.</p><p>Conrad continued. “Not to mention the fact that you have access to certain ‘materials,’ as you call them, along with facilities suitable for working with them. Also, I asked around town about you and discovered you had a reputation for somewhat eccentric behavior. Not an uncommon prejudice when it comes to those who devote themselves to the funereal arts, I admit, but I found the rumors intriguing.”</p><p>Conrad had reached Harrison’s side of the table and now stood only inches from him. Given his height and girth, Harrison rarely felt physically threatened, but even though he outweighed Conrad by a good margin, he felt intimidated by the man, and it was all he could do to keep from shrinking back in his presence.</p><p>“However, after working together for several weeks, it became apparent to me that while you have sufficient...” He glanced at Mason’s clown face. “...imagination, you lack another quality vital to the success of my project.” He reached toward Mason’s face, and with his index finger wiped away a portion of white. He then slowly rubbed the makeup between thumb and forefinger, as if taking his time to get a feel for it. “Do you know what that quality is?”</p><p>Harrison sensed that something was wrong, but he didn’t know what. The emotional atmosphere in the room was like the building electrical charge in the moments before a thunderstorm broke loose, and he didn’t like it. Not one bit.</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Medical training. It’s my own fault, of course. In my day, professions were less specialized than they are now, and scientific advances in biology, anatomy, and medicine, meager as they might have been, were often made by those who worked with the dead. I believed that my experience could make up for what you lacked, but I soon saw that this was hubris on my part. I could not fault your enthusiasm for the work, but our progress was slow, and my lady grows impatient. So when another candidate presented herself, one who had the medical training you lack, I decided to change horses in midstream, as I believe the saying goes.”</p><p>Harrison wondered where Conrad was going with all this. Wherever it was, he doubted it was anywhere good.</p><p>“I can’t say I wasn’t disappointed, but there wasn’t much I could do about it. Besides, you continued to pay me for services rendered, so I figured I couldn’t complain,” Harrison said.</p><p>Harvesting organs and even entire limbs from his clients posed little problem. The organs of course were never missed, and as for the limbs and even torsos, mannequin parts were effective substitutes. If necessary, the hands were gloved due to an unfortunate chemical “accident” that took place during the embalming process. Families were extremely unhappy at this—until Harrison offered them a discount to make up for the extra shock during their time of grief.</p><p>“But my assessment of your skill level turned out to be premature,” Conrad said. “Have you seen today’s paper?”</p><p>Harrison could now guess where the conversation was heading, and he really didn’t like it. “I don’t follow local news. Nothing interesting ever happens in Brennan.”</p><p>“Then it’s most fortunate that I happened to stop at a convenience store on my way over and purchase a copy. I discovered an article I think you might find intriguing, and I clipped it out for you.” He reached into an inner pocket of his jacket, removed a folded piece of newsprint, and held it out to Harrison.</p><p>Harrison didn’t take it right away. He kept the temperature cool in the embalming room—not out of any professional need, simply because he was more comfortable that way—but in the last few minutes the air had grown decidedly chilly. It could have been his imagination, but he didn’t think so. The drop in temperature felt like a sign of danger, the equivalent of an angry rattlesnake shaking its tail in warning. Because of this, Harrison stood frozen, unsure what to do—or not do—next. In the end he reached out and took the clipping from Conrad. He unfolded it, trying to convince himself that he only imagined the newsprint felt cold as ice, and read. It didn’t take long to get through the article, and when he was finished, he looked up and met Conrad’s gaze, although he really didn’t want to.</p><p>“I know you’re responsible for this monstrosity,” Conrad said, “so don’t insult my intelligence with a denial. You’re the only person in town, aside from myself and my current colleague, who could’ve hoped to even have a chance at restoring the dead to life, let alone...” His lips pursed in disgust. “...altering their physiognomy.”</p><p>Despite Conrad’s warning, Harrison nearly denied it anyway, but chose instead to remain silent.</p><p>“I had barely begun tutoring you in the alchemical arts, and the instruction I gave you was minimal at best,” Conrad continued. “You shouldn’t have been able to resurrect an insect, let alone a human.”</p><p>“He has two heads,” Harrison said. “Does that mean he counts as two people?”</p><p>“I understand why you did it.” Conrad glanced at the clown-faced corpse lying on the marble table. “Perhaps <em>understand</em> is too strong a word. I <em>recognize</em> that you have a proclivity for the outré in your work. What I don’t understand is <em>how</em> you accomplished it on your own. Pray, enlighten me.”</p><p>Harrison didn’t see how any good could come from his admitting the truth, but was so thrilled with what he’d done that he had to tell <em>someone</em>—even if that someone might kill him for it.</p><p>“I paid attention to you as you worked,” he said. “Much more attention that you realized. You carry an ancient leather-bound notebook with all sorts of alchemical formulae in it. You left it lying on the counter once, and I was able to flip through it while you were busy with other tasks. I may not have an eidetic memory, but my memory <em>is</em> excellent. Plus, I took pictures of the formulae with my phone for later reference. That information was all I needed to begin my search on the Internet. Then, after you moved on to a new assistant, I got to work. Most of the information I found was nonsense, but I knew what to look for, so I recognized it when I came across the real thing. Once I’d amassed enough knowledge about technique, all I needed was some NuFlesh. I paid a call on Dr. Martinez and told him that I was interested in trying out his wonderful new product as an alternative to mortician’s putty. He gladly sold me several boxes of the material. After that, it was mostly a process of trial and error. Getting hold of the proper chemicals, mixing them in the right proportions under the perfect conditions, performing the rites without a flaw...” He trailed off and gave Conrad an embarrassed smile. “I’m not telling you anything you don’t already know, am I?”</p><p>“You must have used fresh corpses. If any significant decay sets in—“</p><p>“The resurrected’s physical form won’t be stable, and will eventually rot away. I know. Despite the fact that I do have access to the bodies of the recently deceased, families would notice if any of their loved ones turned up missing. So I drove my hearse to Crichton—it’s fifty miles from here—found a pair of donors outside a bar late one night, and picked them up. It really wasn’t any trouble. Ether might be old-fashioned, but it’s a wonderfully effective hunting tool.”</p><p>“You assembled the creature here?” Conrad asked.</p><p>“Yes. I’ve taken to calling him Byron.” He paused, but Conrad gave no reaction. “By-ron? Bi? As in two? Two heads, get it?”</p><p>Conrad looked at him blankly.</p><p>Harrison sighed. It seemed neither the living nor the dead appreciated his sense of humor.</p><p>“And where is the <em>creature</em> now?”</p><p>“How should I know? He’s like a cat, comes and goes as he pleases. He sleeps in an old shed out back where I used to keep lawn equipment. Which works out well. I mean, I can hardly have a naked two-headed man running around inside when there’s a service going on, can I?”</p><p>He thought for a moment. “Do you think Byron will eventually become Brennan’s version of Bigfoot? I hope so. It would be good for the tourist—“</p><p>Before he could say the word “trade,” Conrad’s right hand shot out and grabbed hold of his throat, cutting off both his voice and his air. Conrad’s hand was so cold it burned Harrison’s flesh. He gripped Conrad’s arm with both of his hands and tried to break free, but even though the man didn’t look all that strong, his grip was like frost-covered iron, and Harrison couldn’t dislodge it.</p><p>“While I must admit to being impressed by your initiative, I can’t allow you to interfere with my plans. The last thing I need is any undue attention to be drawn—“</p><p>Conrad’s phone went off in his pocket. Harrison was surprised to hear it had a musical ring tone, and even more surprised that it was Blue Oyster Cult’s “Don’t Fear the Reaper.” Maybe the grim and oh-so-proper Mr. Dippel had a sense of humor after all.</p><p>Conrad maintained his grip on Harrison’s throat as he dug his phone out of his pants pocket with his left hand and answered the call.</p><p>“Hello?” He spoke that one word and no more. He just listened, scowl deepening and jaw clenching. His grip tightened too, and Harrison began to feel lightheaded, almost as if he was floating, and gray spots danced in his vision. He heard the sound of a vast amount of water—a river or even an ocean—roaring as it circled an unimaginably large drain, one that led down into a darkness blacker than any he’d ever conceived. He knew he’d soon be caught up in the swirling tide and swept down into that endless night. He wasn’t afraid, though, was rather looking forward to it, in fact. After working with death for so long, he was finally going to get to experience it for himself. His only regret was that he hadn’t specified in his will who he wanted to prepare his body for burial. There were a couple other morticians in town, but Harrison wouldn’t trust either of them to stuff a turkey, let alone work on his corpse. He supposed he’d have to take what he could get. It was too late to—</p><p>Conrad’s hand sprang open. Released from the man’s grip, Harrison fell to his hands and knees and sucked in wheezing lungfuls of air. It looked like he wasn’t going to die today. He was disappointed, but he consoled himself with the thought that the drain would be there waiting for him when his time came at last.</p><p>Into his phone, Conrad said, “You have my gratitude. I shall bring some more unguent by for you later as a thank you. No charge.”</p><p>He disconnected and put the phone back in his pocket.</p><p>“It seems the undue attention I spoke of has already come to us. You are fortunate the call came when it did, for now I have need of you.” He smiled. “For a while longer, at least. I want you to find this creature of yours, bring it here, confine it, and then contact me immediately.”</p><p>Harrison almost said, “And what if I don’t?” but he already knew the answer to that question, so he simply nodded.</p><p>Without another word, Conrad turned and left the chamber. As soon as he was gone, the temperature began to rise. Harrison got to his feet, still wheezing. He rubbed the frost burns on his throat. He’d do as Conrad ordered. He’d bring Byron home, and the two—or maybe it was three—of them would wait for the grim-faced prick to return. They’d have a surprise in store for Mr. Dippel. Oh yes they would.</p><p>Humming and ignoring his sore throat, Harrison turned his attention back to Mason. He wondered what the man would look like with a purple face. Like an eggplant with hair and eyes, he decided. He couldn’t wait to find out.</p><p>He withdrew a container of cleansing wipes from the makeup kit and began removing the white from Mason’s face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-8">CHAPTER 8</span><a href="#chapter-8" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Have you guys ever done it?”</p><p>Sam’s cheeks burned, and he had to swallow before he could talk. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Trish rolled her eyes, but she smiled as she did so. “Gone hunting, I mean. Has your dad ever taken you?”</p><p>Sam was about to say no, but Dean kicked him in the leg. The three of them had been sitting at the kitchen table for the last hour playing euchre, although Sam had watched Trish more than the cards. During those rare moments when Sam wasn’t looking at Trish, he’d been checking on his brother to see if he was watching her, too. Of course he was. Trish was smart, funny, beautiful, with an air of sadness about her that Sam found irresistible. He was sure Dean felt the same way. How could he not? Most of the time Sam didn’t mind being the younger brother, but every once in a while, he caught Trish looking at Dean in a way she didn’t look at him, and he wished he was the oldest.</p><p>“Sure we have,” Dean said. “Lots of times.”</p><p>Sam gave his brother a look, but he didn’t say anything. Partly because he didn’t want to make Dean mad, but mostly because he didn’t want to look like a whiney little kid in front of Trish. He didn’t like lying to her, but—he rationalized—he wasn’t really. <em>Dean</em> was. Keeping your mouth shut wasn’t the same as lying, was it? But if that was the case, then why did he feel so lousy about it?</p><p>“That’s so cool!” Trish glanced over her shoulder at the basement door behind them. Even though it was closed, and had been the entire time they’d been playing, the nervous way she looked at it made Sam think she half expected her father to be standing there listening. Walter’s “workshop,” as he called it, was set up in the basement, and he’d been working down there for the last couple hours, forging whatever documents his hunter clientele needed.</p><p>She turned back to them. “Dad hates it whenever I ask anything about hunting.” She lowered her voice, even though there was no way her dad could have heard her from down in the basement. “My uncle was a hunter. He got killed by a werewolf.”</p><p>“Werewolves are bad-ass,” Dean said, almost admiringly. Then he looked at Trish, as if just realizing what he’d said. “Sorry,” he mumbled. “I wasn’t thinking.”</p><p>“What else is new?” Sam said with a smirk.</p><p>He hoped to score a couple points with Trish by getting a dig in, but when Dean kicked him in the leg again—much harder this time—he let out an <em>ow!</em> of pain, and he figured that cost him whatever coolness points he might have gained.</p><p>Trish lowered her gaze to the tabletop. “It was the same werewolf that killed my mom.”</p><p>“Damn,” Dean said. “I’m really sorry.”</p><p>“Me, too,” Sam hurried to say, although he wasn’t sure exactly what he was apologizing for. It just felt like the right thing to do.</p><p>Trish kept laying down cards as she spoke, and although Sam felt funny continuing to play the game considering the topic of conversation, he kept on, as did Dean.</p><p>“One summer my family was on a camping trip. I was only nine. My uncle Ryan—my mom’s brother—came along. He’d just gotten divorced from my aunt and was depressed. My parents thought the camping trip might help him get away, clear his head a little, you know?”</p><p>Sam didn’t know, not exactly, but he nodded anyway, as did Dean, who probably <em>did</em> really know—or at least had a better idea of what Trish was talking about.</p><p>“We went on a night hike. Dad hoped we’d see some bats, maybe spot some owls. Mom and Uncle Ryan came along, but before long he said he wasn’t feeling good and was going to head back to camp and turn in. He left, and after a couple minutes, Mom decided to go back, too. She didn’t say anything, but I figure she was worried that he planned to crawl into his tent and drink himself blind. Dad wanted all of us to go back, but Mom told him that it would be a shame for me to miss out on getting to experience the woods at night. Truth was, she probably wanted to keep me away from camp in case Ryan got upset with her for checking up on him and started yelling or something. Dad wasn’t worried about Mom finding her way back to camp on her own in the dark. They were both experienced campers and hikers, and they could handle themselves in the wild just fine. Besides, there was a full moon that night, so there was plenty of light to see by.”</p><p>She glanced at the basement door once again, as if reassuring herself that her father wasn’t going to open it any moment and walk through. After the better part of a minute passed, she resumed her story, continuing to play euchre as she spoke.</p><p>“I don’t know how much longer Dad and I kept hiking. Half an hour, maybe. Whatever it was, it was long enough. When we got back to camp, we found...” She trailed off and looked at the cards remaining in her hand, frowning as if she didn’t remember what they were for. “You know how in horror movies people can always hear the monster attack someone in the woods, no matter how far away they are? We didn’t hear anything at all. No growls or snarls. No screams. Only crickets chirping and night birds singing, as if everything was normal. Dad figures Uncle Ryan tried to fight off the werewolf and protect Mom, but even though he had a rifle with him, he never got off a shot. The damned thing was too fast. Not that it would’ve mattered, since he didn’t have silver bullets. When the werewolf finished with him, it went after Mom. She tried to run, but she didn’t get far from camp before it caught up to her and took her down. She ran in the opposite direction from where Dad and I were. She was trying to lead the werewolf away from us.”</p><p>She stared at the cards for another moment before tossing them onto the table. A second later, Dean did the same, and Sam followed his brother’s lead.</p><p>“What happened to the werewolf?” Dean asked.</p><p>“A couple hunters—your kind of hunters, not the regular kind—had been on its trail for several weeks. They finally tracked it down and killed it before dawn. Stabbed it in the heart with a silver blade. If they’d only found it a few hours earlier...”</p><p>None of them spoke for several moments. It was Dean who eventually broke the silence.</p><p>“It was your aunt, wasn’t it?” he said. “The werewolf, I mean.”</p><p>Trish nodded. “The hunters found us sometime after sunrise. We were still in the camp, both of us in shock. From what they told us, when people change into werewolves they become mindless animals, filled with nothing but hunger, hate, and rage. But some unconscious part of them is driven to prey on those they view as a threat, or who they have some kind of grudge against.” She forced a smile. “My aunt and uncle didn’t exactly have an amicable divorce.” Her smile faded. “I’m thirsty. Do you guys want a drink?”</p><p>The brother shook their heads. Trish got up from the table, went to the sink, filled a glass with tap water, and drank it straight down. She then put the empty glass in the sink and leaned on the counter, arms crossed as she continued her story.</p><p>“Dad didn’t believe the hunters at first. Who would? But they eventually convinced him that what they claimed was true, and they advised him not to say anything about werewolves when he reported the deaths. He agreed and the hunters brought my aunt’s body to our camp and... made it look like she was attacked by an animal, too. Dad and I stayed away while they did it. After what had happened to Mom and Ryan, it was the last thing either of us wanted to witness. Then the hunters wished us good luck and left. We got in our pickup and Dad drove us to town to report what had happened.</p><p>“The next several days were pretty awful, as you might imagine. Dad told the police that my aunt had come along on the camping trip as a last-ditch effort to fix their marriage. He told them he’d taken me on a hike before dawn so we could watch the sunrise together while the others slept. He said that everyone was dead when we got back, and so we jumped in the pickup and raced to town. The police suspected my dad of committing the murders at first, and I think they might’ve continued if I hadn’t backed up his story. After we’d buried everyone, the hunters stopped by our home to see how we were doing. Dad asked them dozens of questions about what it was like to be a hunter, how many of the monsters everyone thought were pretend were actually real, and how he could become a hunter, too. But even filled with sorrow and anger as he was, it was obvious to the hunters that my dad was too gentle a man to follow in their footsteps. As Dad taught art at a local college, that gave the hunters an idea, though. They said that in their line of work they often needed official-looking documents and identification. They didn’t use the word counterfeit, maybe because I’d refused to leave Dad’s side since the murders and they didn’t want to say anything in front of me that made them look like criminals. They said they had a hard time finding anyone to make such documents, let alone someone who could do it right. That’s how Dad started working in, as he calls it, ‘hunter support.’”</p><p>After she was finished, she swallowed. “I’m still so thirsty. Guess I talked a lot, huh?” She turned around and refilled her water glass.</p><p>Sam felt sorry for Trish, but he didn’t know what to say or do. His own mother had died when Sam was a baby, so he felt sympathy for Trish’s loss, but he couldn’t say that he shared it, exactly. He’d never gotten the chance to know his mom, but Trish had been nine when hers had died. Because of that, her mom’s death must have hit her so much harder than he could imagine. In a weird way, though, he was jealous of her. At least she’d had nine years with her mom. She had photos of the two of them together, maybe even videos. If so, she’d always be able to watch them and know what her mother’s voice sounded like, how she moved, how she smiled. Trish had <em>memories</em> of her mom. He didn’t have any of his, not a single one.</p><p>Trish stood at the sink, her back to them, when the glass suddenly shattered in her hand.</p><p>“I know what you’re thinking, Sam.” Her voice had changed. It was deeper, guttural. “You’re jealous of me. You think you had it worse than me because your mom died when you were a baby. You know what? That’s makes me angry.”</p><p>She turned around. Her eyes had become a feral yellow, her fingernails had lengthened into cruel, hooked claws, and her mouth was filled with sharp teeth.</p><p>“<em>Very</em> angry.”</p><p>She raised her clawed hands and ran snarling toward Sam and Dean, spittle running from the corners of her mouth, hunger blazing in her eyes.</p><p>Sam only had time to think <em>I’m sorry</em> before she tore into him.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam woke up to what he first thought was an earthquake, but he quickly realized it was just Dean shaking him by the shoulders.</p><p>“I’m awake,” he said, pushing Dean away from him.</p><p>“It’s about damn time! I’ve been shaking you for almost five minutes, but you didn’t respond. I was about to give up and haul your ass to the nearest hospital.”</p><p>Sam glanced around, still foggy-brained. He was sitting in the passenger seat of the crapmobile, seatbelt unbuckled. The passenger door was open and Dean stood outside, looking equal parts worried and pissed.</p><p>“Guess I dropped off. Sorry.” He hauled himself out of the car and nearly fell when his legs buckled underneath his weight. He managed to grab hold of the open door and keep himself upright, but it was a near thing. His body felt heavy and slow, as if it was filled with wet sand.</p><p>“Dude, something’s wrong with you!” Dean said.</p><p>“I’m fine. Well, no, I’m not, but all I am is tired. Once in a while everything catches up with you. After we’ve taken care of whatever’s going on in this town, I’ll zonk out and sleep as long as it takes to get my energy back, all right? Until then, I’ll just have to make do.”</p><p>Dean still didn’t look happy, but he didn’t protest, which as far as Sam was concerned, was good enough. Trying to look as if he wasn’t fighting to stay awake, he glanced around to see where they were. Dean had parked the car on a gravel shoulder. Trees lined both sides of a narrow blacktopped country lane that had no lines painted on it.</p><p><em>Back road,</em> Sam thought. <em>Probably not too far outside town.</em></p><p>His dream came back to him then, images and emotions slamming into his mind with sledgehammer force. He drew in a surprised breath, and Dean looked alarmed. He started forward, but Sam waved him off.</p><p>“I’m okay. I just remembered what I dreamed about during the drive, that’s all.”</p><p>Dean’s eyes narrowed as if he were scrutinizing Sam, trying to decide whether he was telling the truth or attempting to cover up how bad his condition really was.</p><p>“It was about Trish again,” he said.</p><p>Dean relaxed a bit. “Another rough one, huh?”</p><p>“Yeah. It started out normal enough. It was about the euchre game when she told us how her mom and uncle died. Remember?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “Like it was yesterday.”</p><p>“But at the end it turned... weird.”</p><p>For a second, he was afraid Dean was going to ask him how weird, but he was grateful that his brother didn’t press him for more details.</p><p>They looked at each other for a few moments without speaking.</p><p>“Maybe your crazy’s starting to affect your dreams,” Dean said. “It could be a good sign. Instead of producing hallucinations, your brain is shifting over to having regular old bad dreams. Maybe in time they’ll fade, too.”</p><p>Sam thought about the shadowy figure he’d seen when they’d carried Frankenmutt’s corpse to the car.</p><p>“Maybe,” he said, trying not to sound doubtful. He changed the subject. “So—why are we here?”</p><p>“Maybe you’re so tired lately because you’re catching a cold,” Dean said. “Your nose has got to be clogged with snot, otherwise you’d smell why we’re here.”</p><p>Sam frowned, drew in a deep breath through his nose, and regretted it instantly. Even though they were standing outside of the car, the stink of Frankenmutt was overpowering. Sam wondered if maybe Dean was right and something was wrong with him. How else could he have missed the beast’s rank odor of decay? Was it possible for anyone to be <em>that</em> sleepy? Maybe it was his crazy again. If his mind could make him think he was seeing and hearing things that weren’t there, maybe it could make him unable to perceive something that was. The thought wasn’t a comforting one.</p><p>“I take it that this is where we say goodbye to Frankenmutt,” Sam said.</p><p>“Stinkenstein. I changed his name. And yeah, if we don’t dump his rotting carcass soon, we’ll never be able to get his Frankenfunk off of us.”</p><p>Sam gave his brother a look. “You’re having way too much fun with the Franken-names.”</p><p>“In this job, you take the perks where you can get them. C’mon, help me haul its corpse into the woods. Then we can go back to the motel and take a couple dozen showers apiece.”</p><p>“You think we should burn it?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “Yeah. So far it hasn’t shown any signs that it’s going to get back up and start tearing people’s throats out, but why take chances? If nothing else, burning it will kill the stink—I hope.”</p><p>“Sounds like a plan. Fire always works in Frankenstein movies, right?”</p><p>“That’s what I was thinking. Then again, fire kills just about everything. That’s the beauty of it.”</p><p>The brothers headed to the rear of the car, and Dean inserted the key into the trunk lock, but he didn’t turn it right away. “You might want to try and breathe through your mouth for the next few minutes.”</p><p>Sam nodded and Dean began to turn the key. His phone rang. Leaving the key in the lock, he pulled out his phone and answered it.</p><p>“Hello?” He listened, then glanced at Sam. “Yeah, this is he. Who’s this?” He listened some more. “Sure, yeah, I’ll be there as soon as possible.” He disconnected and tucked the phone back in his pocket.</p><p>“Who was it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Local police. They found the card we left with Lyle Swanson—on his body. His withered, dried-up body. We got ourselves another victim of The Pruning.”</p><p>“Think the Double-Header paid him a return visit?”</p><p>“That’d be my guess. Whoever’s making these monsters, it’s like they’ve got a damn assembly line going. Let’s go torch Stinkenstein and haul ass over to Lyle’s.”</p><p>Dean turned the key and the trunk popped open. A stench wave hit them like a solid wall, and both brothers took a couple steps backward.</p><p>“Can’t we just burn him right there in the trunk?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Tempting, but we might blow up the car in the process. Not that it would be any great loss,” Dean added. “C’mon, the sooner we get this over with, the better.”</p><p>Sam nodded, and they got to work. One good thing about the stench: at least it kept him awake.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad knelt naked on the floor of what once was the warehouse for Kingston Bicycles. The facility had no electricity and hadn’t for many years, but that didn’t trouble him. The warehouse’s windows were dirty and streaked, but enough light filtered through for his needs. Besides, electric light was still something of a novelty to Conrad. He’d gotten by for the majority of his long existence with candles or lamplight. Just because the world had changed didn’t mean he had to as well. Sometimes the old ways were best.</p><p>Case in point: hanging from the rafters in front of him was a piglet. He’d purchased the animal from a local farmer several days before, and had kept it tied up in a corner of the warehouse on a bed of sawdust with straw scattered over it. He’d made sure the animal had plenty of food and water—it was important that it be healthy and strong—and when he’d gotten the chance, he’d even taken it out for short walks to give it some exercise. Now it dangled at the end of a rope, wriggling and squealing, back hooves bound tight, head pointed at the floor. Conrad didn’t mind the noises the animal made. On the contrary, he appreciated them, for they were sounds of life, and the more life the piglet had in it, the better.</p><p>The tools Conrad had brought with him were simple. A stone bowl and knife, very old and worn from much use, both emblazoned with ancient runes. If a linguistics scholar had been present, he or she might have recognized the runes as being similar to those used by the Norse people, but these symbols predated those by centuries. The bowl rested directly beneath the squirming piglet, and next to it, the blade pointed north. The bowl was named Hunger, and the knife called Famine.</p><p>Conrad closed his eyes, bowed his head, and then spoke in a reverent voice. The language he used was a forerunner of Old Norse.</p><p>“Hel, <em>Frau Holle,</em> Dark Mother, Guardian of Graves, Queen of Night Unending, I beg you to accept this sacrifice from your most unworthy of servants.”</p><p>This particular sacrifice wasn’t as elaborate as those conducted in the old days, long before Conrad’s birth. Back then, entire villages would sacrifice pigs and horses, boiling the meat in large cooking pits, and sprinkling the animals’ blood on statues of their deities. The villagers would eat the meat, drink mead, and pray for a good year and peace. In some villages, during every ninth year there was a <em>blotan</em>—or sacrificial—feast of nine days, during which nine males of each species, men included, were sacrificed, their bodies hung from the branches of trees near the temple. The most devout villages sacrificed ninety-nine people—men, women, and children—and although Conrad admired their devotion, few villages were large enough to survive the loss of so much of their population every nine years.</p><p>Conrad knew rites such as the one he was about to perform were more symbolic than literal, but he’d served Hel for over three hundred years, and he knew that the dark goddess, while understanding the necessity of a downsized sacrifice in the modern world, still expected her servants to get the basics right, to cross their T’s and dot their I’s, as it were.</p><p>He opened his eyes, picked up Famine, and touched the blade’s tip to the sacred nine points of life on his body: the genitals (from which life sprung), the heart (which pumped blood), the nose, the mouth, and both lungs (all involved in breathing), the stomach (which digested food), the forehead (behind which lay the brain), and lastly his right hand (which held weapons and tools with which to fight, hunt, and build). Holding Famine with his left hand, he carved a single rune into the flesh of his right palm. To a modern English speaker, the symbol would have resembled a large X, but it stood for the word <em>gebo,</em> meaning gift. Conrad waited until the blood was flowing strongly, and then pressed his palm against the side of the piglet. He returned Famine to his right hand, gripping the stone handle tight so his blood smeared it, then carved the rune for <em>gebo</em> into the piglet—the animal now squealing in terror—until its blood mingled with his own, mystically linking the two of them. Conrad and the piglet were now one, and the sacrifice of its life would substitute for the sacrifice of his. That is, if he’d done everything right. If not, Hel would take his life along with the piglet’s. After three centuries, he could perform this ritual in his sleep, but that didn’t mean he was incapable of making a mistake, and even the smallest flaw might upset his lady. He hoped that if she found his sacrifice wanting, she would forgive him, if for no other reason than because she still had need of him.</p><p>He grabbed hold of the back of the piglet’s neck to keep it steady, and then with a single swift, practiced swipe, he sliced open the animal’s throat. Blood poured from the wound and into Hunger below. Conrad held the blade beneath the flow to wet it, and then flicked it toward each of the sacred nine points of his body, splashing himself with the piglet’s blood. He then placed Famine on the floor next to Hunger, pressed his wounded hand over his heart, closed his eyes, and waited. He listened as the sound of blood splatter lessened, became a trickle, then slowed to intermittent drops. When it stopped at last, he opened his eyes.</p><p>Hunger was filled with dark blood, but as Conrad watched, the level began to lower. Within moments, the blood was gone, absorbed into the stone. He smiled. Hel had accepted his sacrifice.</p><p>He bowed his head.</p><p>“My lady, two men have come to Brennan. I believe they intend to interfere with our plans, and I ask for the means to track them, so I might slay them before they can cause us further difficulty.”</p><p>Someone else might have asked Hel to strike the two men dead, but he knew the dark queen preferred her servants practice self-reliance. The gods help those who help themselves.</p><p>For several moments, nothing happened, and Conrad began to fear that his lady had forsaken him. Then he heard a voice whisper in his mind, the words like a midnight wind blowing across the icy surface of a frozen lake.</p><p><em>So it shall be.</em></p><p>The rune he’d carved into his palm erupted with fresh pain far more intense than anything a mere cut could cause. It was a cold pain, but a cold so strong it burned like fire. He gritted his teeth and pulled his hand away from his chest. He watched as the blood that still welled forth from the X he’d carved into himself froze and became crimson ice. The pain worsened and the sensation of cold spread through his body. He began to shiver. Despite the cold sensation, sweat poured off of him as he fought to endure the agony. Finally, just as the pain had become so bad that he was considering snatching up Famine with his left hand and hacking off his right, the sensation began to lessen. Within moments, it was gone, leaving behind only a dull, distant throbbing.</p><p>He examined his palm. The blood was gone and the wound healed, leaving behind an X-shaped black scar. Conrad held his hand straight out before him experimentally. He felt the cold return, though far less painfully this time, and only on the left edge of the rune. He moved his hand leftward, and the cold spread farther, until it covered the entire rune. He smiled. Hel had given him the equivalent of a compass to track the two meddlers. The rune was indeed now a <em>gebo</em>—a gift—but now a gift from the goddess instead of to her.</p><p>He inclined his head in gratitude. “I praise your eternal darkness, my lady.”</p><p>He rose to his feet, ready to begin the hunt. Then he glanced down at his body, splattered with blood from the ritual. Perhaps he should clean himself up first. He looked at the dead piglet dangling over the empty stone bowl. Maybe he should avail himself of the opportunity for some sustenance, too. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d eaten, and he was <em>so</em> fond of raw pig heart.</p><p>He bent down, picked up Famine, and started cutting.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“Did you see the way those cops reacted to us?” Dean asked. “Now I know why they call it getting the stink eye. We reek!”</p><p>“At least our stench will keep them out of the house while we check the scene,” Sam said. They’d stopped on the drive over for yet another coffee for Sam, and he sipped it now.</p><p>“No need for that,” Dean said. “They’re already too worried about catching whatever plague they think is responsible for The Pruning. They don’t want to spend any more time in here than they have to.”</p><p>“Whatever works,” Sam said, and took another sip of coffee. “I mean, they were in such a hurry to get out, they didn’t question the logic of agents posing as reporters to question Lyle.”</p><p>They stood in Lyle’s kitchen. The county medical examiner had already come and gone, but Lyle’s body hadn’t been removed yet in order to give the “agents” a chance to examine it. He sat on the floor, his back against a cupboard door, a withered husk, parchment-dry skin stretched tight across bone.</p><p>“You don’t have to be a forensics expert to read <em>this</em> crime scene,” Dean said. “Double-Header busted down the back door, slurped up Lyle’s life energy, then took off. I wonder who reported Lyle’s death.”</p><p>“I heard a couple cops talking outside as we walked up. Looks like Lyle was in the process of picking up trash in his back yard when the Double-Header came after him. He never finished—obviously. Later on, the wind kicked up, started blowing trash into his neighbor’s yard—“</p><p>“I get the picture. Neighbor comes over, all pissed off and ready to complain, and finds our boy Lyle prune-ified.”</p><p>“Yep.” Sam hit his coffee once more.</p><p>Dean wondered how much coffee, with added espresso shots, someone could drink before suffering a caffeine overdose. Though Sam didn’t seem to be experiencing any symptoms. So far, all the coffee he’d guzzled hadn’t shifted his system into overdrive. Hell, it had barely kept him awake. Still, he’d have to make sure Sam didn’t make himself sick.</p><p>He had hoped that the smell of Sam’s coffee might help to leaven the stench of the late, unlamented Frankenmutt that clung to them, but if anything, he found the mingled scents even more nauseating. The combined smells didn’t seem to bother Sam, but Dean didn’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing. Over the years, Sam had suffered a number of experiences that had altered his behavior one way or another, and it had gotten to the point where Dean wasn’t sure what normal was for his brother anymore. Not that he was one to talk. He’d lost more than a few of his own marbles over the years. He supposed that was one of the reasons the two of them stayed together. Sure, they were family, but they also kept each other going, almost out of habit. If they were this bad now, he wondered what they’d be like when they were old men. Not that there was any guarantee they’d live long enough to reach their golden years. There was a reason why hunters never bothered to save for retirement. All they needed to save for was the cost of a burial. And even that was an iffy proposition, since when they died—assuming they really did die, rather than being turned into a vampire or something—there might not be enough of them left to put in the ground.</p><p>The morbid turn his thoughts had taken—an occupational hazard—inevitably led him to think about Bobby. No condo in Florida for him. At least he and Sam had been able to bury Bobby, first burning his bones so there was no chance he’d come back as a vengeful spirit. He reached into his jacket pocket and touched Bobby’s flask. <em>I miss you,</em> he thought. For a moment, the flask’s metal seemed to warm beneath his fingers, then the sensation was gone, and he dismissed it as his imagination.</p><p>“Both the Double-Header and Frankenmutt drain their victims’ life force,” Dean said. “They might not look anything alike, but they’re basically the same kind of monster.”</p><p>“They’re combinations of different bodies,” Sam pointed out. “So in that sense they do resemble one another.”</p><p>“So we’re definitely looking for a mad scientist type.”</p><p>“Or a mad sorcerer. There’s no way science alone could create monsters like these.”</p><p>“Maybe whoever’s responsible swings both ways,” Dean suggested.</p><p>“So we’re dealing with what? A sorcentist?”</p><p>Dean gave his brother a look. “From now on, leave coming up with the wacky nicknames to me, okay?”</p><p>“Fine.” Sam thought for a moment. “If what we’ve got here is some kind of new fusion of science and magic, it could be something the Leviathan have no defense against.”</p><p>“So we might actually be close to finding Leviathan kryptonite.”</p><p>“Leviathanite?”</p><p>“Dude—seriously.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You’re really quite beautiful, you know. In fact, I’d go so far as to say you’re a masterpiece.”</p><p>Harrison watched Byron take another bite of his—its—their—treat. Each head had two chocolate bars, one for each hand, and they ate in almost perfect unison, raising the candy to their mouths at the same time, biting down, chewing, and swallowing. Harrison had done nothing to connect their brains, so he knew their synchronized movements had no physiological base, which made them all the more fascinating to watch, especially with four hands delivering the chocolate. He was glad to see that the heads had no difficulty swallowing. One of the trickier bits of Byron’s creation had been connecting both heads to a single alimentary canal. It would’ve been impossible without NuFlesh, not to mention the mystical augmentations Harrison had picked up from Conrad. All in all, he was quite pleased. Next time, perhaps he’d try for three heads—a hat trick.</p><p>Byron sat cross-legged on the floor of the shed while he ate, and Harrison stood watching near the door, a stun gun held at his side. Harrison had ordered the weapon online before he began working on Byron, just in case his creation decided to get a bit feisty. The charge the gun delivered wasn’t strong enough to do any serious damage to Byron, but because his mental level was barely above that of an infant, the pain of the electrical jolt was enough to discipline him. Harrison had rarely needed to use the stun gun, though, not when chocolate produced far more effective results. Byron derived no nourishment from food, and it would do nothing to satisfy the hunger that now burned at the core of his being, but it tasted good, and that made it an excellent motivator. Finding Byron and bringing him to the shed had been child’s play. All Harrison had needed to do was wander through the woods behind the Legacy Center, waving an unwrapped chocolate bar in the air and calling out, “I’ve got a treaty for my sweetie!” until Byron came loping toward him, drooling with anticipation. After that, Byron would have followed Harrison to the center of town as long as he received chocolate at the end of the trip. Nevertheless, Harrison still held onto the stun gun. Candy was dandy, but it was no substitute for several million volts of electricity.</p><p>He was a bit worried about his boy—boys. On the way to the shed, he’d had a chance to look Byron over thoroughly, and while his body was predictably dirty and scratched from gallivanting around the woods, Harrison had also noted the first signs of incipient decay. Just a few patches here and there, but it meant that his creation didn’t have much time left. A week, perhaps two at the most. And as the decay grew worse, so would Byron’s hunger, driving him to seek out living creatures and absorb their life energy. Doing so would stave off his decay for a time, but it would only be a temporary stay of execution. Death would inevitably come to him.</p><p>“It’s such a shame. But look at it this way: you’ve managed to escape the Drain, if only for a short time.”</p><p>Neither of Byron’s heads looked at him as he spoke. They were too intent on finishing their treats. They ate with messy delight, smacking chocolate-smeared lips in between bites and humming tonelessly in a way that seemed to Harrison almost like purring.</p><p>He had complied with Conrad’s demand to fetch Byron, but that was as far as he intended to cooperate with the ancient alchemist. Conrad had never told Harrison who he really was, but it had taken no great effort to find out. For pity’s sake, he hadn’t even changed his name! A quick Internet search did the trick. Nevertheless, even given who Dippel was and the terrible knowledge that was his to command, Harrison wasn’t afraid of him. The old man had enjoyed a nice long run, but it was time for someone else to take over. Someone like Harrison. And Byron was going to help him do it. When Conrad returned, Harrison would serve him to Byron for lunch. All he had to do was figure out a way—</p><p>The shed door opened.</p><p>“Hello, Harrison.” Conrad, impeccably dressed as always, stepped inside and Harrison stepped back to make room. His gaze focused on Byron, and while his nose wrinkled in disgust—Harrison had to admit his boys didn’t smell their freshest at the moment—he seemed pleased. “Excellent work.”</p><p>“I pride myself on my customer service,” Harrison said. “It is, after all, at the heart of the funeral industry.”</p><p>He hadn’t expected Conrad to return so soon, and the man’s appearance had taken him by surprise. He took a quick glance around the shed, casting about for anything that he might be able to use for a weapon, but aside from a coiled length of hose, a rusty lawn sprinkler, and an old bag of peat moss, the shed was empty. When Byron had first started sleeping there, Harrison had removed everything that might prove a danger to him. So no sharp garden tools, no hammers, no axes.</p><p>As a businessman, he believed in the value of a carefully thought out plan. It was, after all, one of his primary sales tools. He’d even paid for a billboard out on the highway with a cartoon of a grinning man standing up in a coffin, hands held high above his head with enthusiastic joy, and above him in large letters this slogan: “Preplanning is Fun!” Beneath the coffin in smaller letters: “Put your mind at rest before you’re laid to rest. Brauer Legacy Center.” But as important as having a plan was, sometimes you just had to improvise.</p><p>Harrison turned to Conrad, jammed the stun gun against the side of the man’s neck, and activated the device. There was a loud crackling sound, accompanied by the stink of ozone and scorched flesh. Conrad’s body jerked and shuddered, and Harrison kept the stun gun pressed to his neck, giving him an extra-strong dose of juice. When he figured the man had enough, Harrison pulled the gun away, grabbed hold of his arm, and shoved him toward Byron. Conrad stumbled toward the creature, lost his footing, and fell onto the floor directly in front of him. Alarm crossed both of Byron’s faces, and he began hooting in surprise and fear, sounding like a pair of frightened apes.</p><p>“Drain him!” Harrison shouted. “Suck him dry!”</p><p>Byron’s second head—the one Harrison had added to the original body and which hung at an odd angle—looked at him blankly, but the original head’s eyes narrowed with cunning. That side of the body dropped what was left of its chocolate bars and slapped its hands on Conrad. The second head finally figured out what was happening, and it too dropped its treats and grabbed hold of Conrad.</p><p>Harrison grinned with cruel satisfaction. This was working out even better than he’d hoped. It would all be over within moments, and then he’d be rid of that arrogant prick once and for—</p><p>Conrad, looking a bit disheveled but by no means panicked, reached into the inner pocket of his suit jacket and removed an envelope. He opened it and flung the contents in Byron’s faces. A fine yellow powder spread outward in a small cloud, and both of Byron’s heads inhaled it. The second one sneezed.</p><p>“Stop,” Conrad said.</p><p>Byron stiffened.</p><p>“Release me.”</p><p>Byron removed all four hands from Conrad’s person. Conrad pulled himself to his feet, smoothed out his pants, and adjusted his tie.</p><p>“It was a valiant effort, Harrison, but electricity, against me? Please! I was working with electricity before Benjamin Franklin was a spark in his daddy’s eye.” Without glancing at Byron he said, “Stand,” and Harrison’s creature did. But then, Harrison supposed it wasn’t his creature anymore, was it?</p><p>“How did you put it, Harrison? Oh yes.” Conrad gave the mortician a slow, wicked smile. “‘Drain him. Suck him dry.’”</p><p>Byron started forward, and Harrison knew that he was finally going to find out what death was like. He was surprised to discover he wasn’t looking forward to it as much as he’d anticipated.</p><h2><span id="chapter-9">CHAPTER 9</span><a href="#chapter-9" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The Winchester brothers traipsed through the woods behind Lyle’s house in search of the Double-Header. Now that they had a better idea what they were up against, they’d come better armed. Dean carried both his Colt and the Winchester 1887 shotgun, and Sam carried his Beretta and the Baikal sawed-off double-barreled shotgun. Both had back-up pistols as well as KA-BAR knives and plenty of extra ammo. In addition, they each carried several flares. Frankenmutt had gone up like a pile of dry kindling, and while they didn’t know if the Double-Header would be as flammable, they figured the flares were extra insurance. <em>Besides,</em> Dean had pointed out, <em>maybe he’ll be afraid of fire, just like in the movies. You know, “Fire bad!”</em></p><p>As they walked, Sam fought like hell to keep from yawning. He didn’t want Dean to worry about him, and he knew his brother was watching him. Despite what he’d told Dean about his weariness being no big deal, Sam was starting to wonder if something more was going on with him than simple exhaustion. No matter what he did, he couldn’t manage to fully wake. Neither sleep nor copious amounts of caffeine seemed to help. He felt slow, not just physically, but mentally, too, like he had molasses running through his veins instead of blood. If they did find the Double-Header, Sam worried that he wouldn’t react fast enough, and he’d end up getting his brother killed. To add to all that, the place where Frankenmutt had bitten him had started to hurt again. The wound throbbed with every step he took, and it was an effort to keep from limping. He hadn’t examined the wound yet—he couldn’t very well do so with his brother around, not without alerting him that something was wrong—but he had the feeling that it wasn’t looking too good.</p><p>He thought about what Dean had said earlier, about how his crazy might have turned inward, which was why he’d been having nightmares about Trish. If that was true, maybe both his weariness and the pain in his leg were additional symptoms of the crazy. The bite on his leg had stopped hurting, and looked like it was healing normally, so why should it suddenly start up again? What if he was having hallucinations, but instead of <em>seeing</em> things this time, he was <em>feeling</em> them?</p><p><em>Forget it,</em> he told himself. <em>One problem at a time. First we gank the Double-Header, then I can worry about my leg.</em></p><p>“I hate hunting new monsters,” Dean said. “Too unpredictable.”</p><p>“On the bright side, a two-headed, four-armed naked guy ought to be easy enough to spot.” Sam said.</p><p>“That’s another thing: couldn’t the mad scientist who made the Double-Header have been considerate enough to at least put a pair of shorts on him? I really don’t want to see his monster dork swinging in the wind when he charges us.”</p><p>They’d considered trying the same technique they used to lure Frankenmutt—using Sam’s phone to simulate a crying baby—but had decided against it. For one thing, the Double-Header had just had a nice big meal of Lyle’s life energy, so there was a good chance he wouldn’t be hungry again for a while. For another, unlike Frankenmutt, the Double-Header was human, or at least he had been, and it was hard to say how intelligent he was. From what Lyle had described, it sounded as if the creature was acting at least partially animalistic—why else would he be digging through Lyle’s trash looking for a snack, and in broad daylight? But he had to retain a certain degree of cunning, at least, and without a driving hunger to goad him into ignoring his instincts, there was a good chance he’d sense that the baby cries were part of a trap. So they’d decided to do things the old-fashioned way: walking through the woods and offering themselves as a pair of meals that the Double-Header, full though he might be, would find too tempting to pass up.</p><p>“He probably has a... a...” Sam struggled to recall the word he was looking for. It was increasingly becoming an effort to think clearly. “...a <em>lair</em> somewhere close by. It gets pretty chilly after dark this time of year, and he’d need somewhere to hole up for the night.”</p><p>Dean frowned at him, and Sam knew his brother had noted his verbal hesitation. “Probably not a cave. This isn’t really cave-y country. I vote for an old barn or maybe an abandoned house.”</p><p>“Sounds good. I say we keep our eyes out for—“</p><p>A branch snapped behind them. The sound wasn’t loud at all, and anyone else might have ignored it, but Sam and Dean’s instincts had been honed to a razor-sharp edge over the years. The two of them whirled around, shotguns raised and ready to fire...</p><p>... only to find themselves looking at a wide-eyed and very surprised rabbit.</p><p>The stare-down lasted only a few seconds before the rabbit turned tail and scurried off, running in a zigzag pattern through underbrush and scattered leaves.</p><p>Dean turned to Sam and grinned. “Why do I suddenly feel like Elmer Fudd?”</p><p>Sam was about to reply when his instincts kicked in again, screaming a warning. He started to turn, but he was too slow, and something struck his chest with pile-driver force. The impact sent him flying backward, and he landed hard, losing his grip on his shotgun in the process. Stunned and feeling as if he’d just gone ten rounds with Godzilla, Sam struggled to sit up. He saw Dean fighting with the Double-Header, the creature no doubt responsible for knocking Sam off his pins. With its top pair of hands the Double-Header had grabbed hold of the barrel of Dean’s shotgun and was pushing it this way and that, preventing Dean from getting a good shot. With the bottom pair, the creature had grabbed Dean under the arms and lifted him into the air as if he was a child. Cussing a blue streak, Dean repeatedly kicked the Double-Header in the gut, and lower, but if the creature felt any pain as a result of the blows, he didn’t show it. One of his heads grinned, the other laughed, and drool ran from the corners of both mouths. As a hunter, Sam had seen some truly disturbing things over the years, but this scene ranked near the top of his personal Most Freakish list.</p><p>Sam knew he should do something, but his head was still reeling from the blow he’d taken, and his chest burned like fire. He figured he had a cracked rib or two at the very least. Normally, he would have been able to push past the pain and disorientation and go to his brother’s aid, but added to the deep weariness that had taken hold of him, it was too much. He couldn’t think straight, and although he wanted nothing more than to get off his ass and go help his brother, he had no idea what he should do.</p><p>The Double-Header started shaking Dean as if he were a shotgun-toting rag doll, and both heads laughed in delight. As Sam watched, shadows appeared on the pair of the creature’s arms that were holding Dean off the ground, the darkness roiling and seething as if alive. The shadows, which looked something like animated black tattoos, slithered down the arms until they were concentrated in the hands pressed to Dean’s sides. Dean let out a cry that was half shout, half moan, and renewed his exertions, desperate to break free of the Double-Header’s grip.</p><p>The Double-Header was draining Dean’s life force. Dean’s energy was waning fast, and within seconds he was moving more slowly, the fight leaving him along with his strength.</p><p>Fighting against his lethargy, Sam moved into a crouching position, drew his Beretta, and fired. His aim was off, and instead of hitting the darker right head dead center at the base of the skull as he planned, the head’s right ear vanished in a spray of red mist and splintered cartilage. Still, the wound had the desired effect. Startled and in pain, the Double-Header released its grip on both Dean and his shotgun, and whirled around to see who had hurt it. Dean crumpled to the ground and lay there, dazed but alive.</p><p>The creature reached up with one of its hands to gingerly touch the ragged bloody ruin where the ear had been. When he removed his hand, the fingers came away slick with blood. He examined them with two pairs of eyes, both heads seeming puzzled, as if they couldn’t quite comprehend what they were looking at. Then it must have hit them, for one head wailed in despair and the other started crying.</p><p><em>They’re like little kids,</em> Sam thought. <em>Toddlers trapped in one huge, monstrous body.</em></p><p>He felt sorry for the Double-Header, and was reminded of the way the Frankenstein monster was sometimes portrayed—as a childlike innocent who had never asked to be reborn as a freakish abomination, and who only wanted to be left alone.</p><p>Both heads looked up at Sam, expressions twisting into masks of hate. Two mouths bellowed in single rage, and the creature charged.</p><p>The time for sympathy was over. Sam squeezed off three more rounds as the Double-Header ran toward him. On any other day, Sam would have put all three into the creature’s heart, but right then it was an effort to hold the gun steady, and his vision was blurry around the edges. The first round only managed to take off the last two fingers on one of the hands. Painful, but hardly a kill shot. The second round struck the left shoulder, but while the impact made the Double-Header stagger for a second, it didn’t slow it down. Better, but still not good enough. The third round was, as the saying goes, the money shot. It hit the right head—which Sam thought of as the main one, since it appeared to be original to the body—and tore away a good chunk of the skull in a spray of red.</p><p>The Double-Header, or maybe it was the One-and-a-Half-Header now, came to a halt only a couple feet away from Sam. It swayed on its feet, the fingers on all four hands twitching spastically. The wounded head lolled on its neck, eyes wide and staring. The second head turned to look at its companion, gaze dull and uncomprehending. The hands on the second head’s side of the body tried to reach up, probably intending to touch the wounded head, just as the creature had explored the ragged ear stump a moment before, but the limbs jerked and spasmed, flailing the air as if the Double-Header was having some kind of seizure.</p><p>Sam thought he knew what was happening. The second, fairer head was wired into the body’s overall nervous system, but the connections weren’t as strong as they could be. The first head was the dominant one, responsible for primary control of the body. Without it, the second head struggled to do the job on its own. Sam kept his Beretta trained on the Double-Header. If he could have trusted his aim, he would’ve put a round into the second head to end the creature’s misery, but as it was, he decided to hold off firing for a few moments. It was possible that the second head would be unable to keep the heart and lungs functioning by itself, and the creature would die soon. If that was the case, all he would have to do was wait for it to collapse, and it would be game over.</p><p>Sam watched the Double-Header lurch and flail, moving like a marionette whose puppeteer was having an epileptic fit.</p><p>He caught more movement out of the corner of his eye, and turned, swiveling the Beretta toward whatever new threat presented itself. He expected it to be another creature, but instead what he saw was a slender man wearing a suit and tie standing near an elm tree. It looked as if he’d been hiding and had stepped out of concealment to get a better look at what was happening. He raised his right hand—Sam saw it had some kind of black mark on the palm—and gestured. Sam wondered if this could be the hazy figure he’d glimpsed several times since arriving in Brennan, finally come into sharper focus.</p><p>He didn’t have time to wonder long. The Double-Header gained a modicum of control over its uncooperative body and took a single lurching step forward. Then it took a second step.</p><p>The surviving head glared at Sam, murder in its eyes, and it stretched all four hands toward him. Writhing black shadows appeared on the creature’s arms, and Sam knew that the Double-Header planned to drain his life force to avenge the death of its companion.</p><p>Sam swung the Beretta back around, aimed at the creature’s heart, and fired.</p><p>He’d aimed too low, and the round entered the Double-Header’s midsection. The impact caused the creature to double over, but it quickly straightened. Blood ran from the wound, but the creature ignored it and continued toward Sam.</p><p>He aimed for the heart again, taking his time, trying not to look at the dark energy swirling around the creature’s hands, trying not to think about how close it was, and how much closer it was getting, but before he could squeeze the trigger, he heard his brother’s voice.</p><p>“Yippee ki-yay, mamasita!”</p><p>A shotgun blast sounded like thunder, and the once Double-Header ended its strange second life as a No-Header. The creature pitched forward and hit the ground like a slab of lifeless meat—which was exactly what it had become. Sam looked up and saw Dean lower his shotgun. He had dark circles under his eyes, and he looked exhausted, but he was alive, and that was all that mattered.</p><p>“Mamasita?” Sam said.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Trying to cut back on the swearing.”</p><p>Sam struggled to his feet. “Admirable, but it lacks a little something in the tough guy department.”</p><p>He remembered the man in the suit, and turned in his direction, ready to fire, but the man was gone.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Dean said. “I saw him, too. Moves pretty fast for an older guy.”</p><p>Sam caught another flicker of movement, this time in the opposite direction. He turned and saw the familiar hazy, shadowy figure that he’d seen before, standing about a hundred yards away. He pointed toward it.</p><p>“How about that one?” he asked.</p><p>Dean looked in the direction he indicated. “Sorry. That one I don’t see.”</p><p>Sam squinted, trying to bring the figure into clearer focus, but it was no use. A second later, it was gone.</p><p>He sighed. At least the guy in the suit hadn’t been a hallucination.</p><p>He tucked his Beretta into the waistband of his pants, retrieved the sawed-off shotgun he’d dropped when the Double-Header had sent him flying, and together he and Dean approached the creature’s corpse.</p><p>Dean kicked it a couple times to make sure it was dead. In their line of work, you never knew if something you put down was going to stay down. The creature didn’t move.</p><p>“I guess it’s officially the Double-Deader now,” Dean said.</p><p>Sam gave him a weak smile. “Okay, that one’s kind of funny.” His smile faded. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I could sleep for a week, but otherwise, I’m all right. I don’t think he managed to siphon too much out of my tank.”</p><p>They turned their attention to the dead monster and rolled it over so they could get a better look at it. Now that they were able to examine the body closely, Sam could see that it had scar lines similar to Frankenmutt’s, only they were confined to where the extra head and arms had been joined to the main body. The Double-Header had been made from fewer pieces than Frankenmutt, and his scar lines were flesh-colored instead of white.</p><p>“NuFlesh?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I think so. But there’s something wrong about these scars.” Sam crouched down and rubbed at the line around the base of one of the extra arms.</p><p>“Careful,” Dean said. “You don’t want to catch Frankencooties.”</p><p>Sam held up his fingers for Dean to see. “Someone covered up his scars with makeup. That’s why they aren’t as obvious as Frankenmutt’s.” He frowned. “He’s got patches of decay on him, too. They’re not very big yet, but they’re definitely present. It looks like he was starting to rot, just like Frankenmutt.”</p><p>“At least he doesn’t smell as bad yet,” Dean said. “Not that he’s a rose or anything right now.”</p><p>Sam wiped his fingers off on the ground before standing.</p><p>“Guess we didn’t need the flares,” Sam said.</p><p>“They still might come in handy,” Dean said. “What do you think the odds are that there are only two patchwork monsters in town?”</p><p>“Not very good,” Sam said.</p><p>“C’mon, let’s gather some wood and torch this son of a bitch. Then see if we can figure out who Mr. Suit-and-Tie is.” He yawned. “After we go back to the hotel and take a nap.”</p><p>Seeing Dean yawn made Sam do the same. “That’s the best idea you’ve had in a long time.”</p><p>The brothers, both moving slow as a pair of zombies, got to work.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad moved through the woods far more swiftly and silently than was humanly possible, but that was only to be expected, as he hadn’t been human in three centuries.</p><p>He wasn’t pleased by the creature’s failure to slay the two men. If he hadn’t already killed Harrison, he surely would have done so now. In fact, he was tempted to bring the fool back to life just so he could deprive him of it once again. The encounter had been far from a total loss, however, for he had gained some valuable data.</p><p>He now knew who the two men were. Not their specific identities, those hardly mattered, but he knew what their profession was. They were <em>hunters.</em> Given the nature of the experiments Conrad had conducted over the previous three hundred years—not to mention the results—he had encountered their kind before, and while they’d usually managed to destroy his creations, none of them had ever come close to killing him, and he intended to, in current parlance, keep his streak alive.</p><p>That wasn’t the most important piece of information he’d learned from the failure of Harrison’s two-headed monstrosity, though. Something else had been observing the proceedings, and while to all other eyes this observer would have gone unseen, Conrad’s special status—not dead but technically not alive—allowed him to perceive what others could not. This day a Reaper had been present in the woods. A Reaper!</p><p>During his long existence, Conrad had learned much. He was a master of the ancient art of alchemy—perhaps the only one left in the world—and he was well skilled in the runic magic practiced by the Norse people. He had also picked up a great deal of supernatural lore during his time, and he knew that Reapers were beings who appeared to humans at the moment of their deaths and ushered their souls into the afterlife. They were, in a very real sense, the Death Force personified, and a Reaper, or more accurately, the power it contained, could be the final piece of a puzzle he’d been trying to solve for the last three centuries.</p><p>He needed to return to the bicycle factory and consult his mistress at once. She would know the best way to lure and capture a Reaper. After all, was she not an aspect of Death as well? Of course, if he expected her to grant him such arcane knowledge, he would need a sacrifice of more substance than a mere piglet. He thought of the farmer who had sold him the animal. The man was in his fifties, but he was still healthy, strong, and hardworking. He’d do.</p><p>It looked like he would be making a stop before returning to Kingston Bicycles.</p><p>Conrad didn’t question the Reaper’s presence. He assumed it was following the hunter, the one who’d been bitten by the dog and infected with the creature’s taint. The boy was dying slowly, and the Reaper was like a vulture, circling and waiting for its meal to finish the business of expiring before swooping down to claim it. He hoped the boy would survive for a while yet. The longer he took to die, the longer the Reaper would remain, giving Conrad a better chance to capture it.</p><p>He was more excited than he had been in decades. At last, victory was within his grasp!</p><p><em>Soon, my lady, you shall tread upon the face of the Earth, and all who behold you will marvel at your beauty and wail in despair. It shall be glorious!</em></p><p>He ran faster.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel walked through the woods, trailing the Winchester brothers at a discrete distance. Sam had seen too much of him, and he wanted to make sure to remain out of sight, at least for the time being.</p><p>Daniel’s kind didn’t worry, at least not in the way mortals did, for they had a different perspective on existence. What mortals saw as terrible tragedies were more like skinned knees and bloody noses to Reapers, momentary pains that had no lasting significance in the face of Eternity. Nevertheless, Daniel had to admit to being... concerned.</p><p>He’d been drawn to Brennan because of Conrad Dippel. All beings who defied the natural order and lived beyond their years were violating the ancient pact God and Death made before the birth of the universe. In order for Creation to be a living, growing thing, there had to be Time, and if there was Time, then there had to be a way to mark its passage. For every Before an After, for every Beginning an End, for every Life a Death. Daniel was charged with ensuring this balance was maintained, and he supposed that made him a hunter, too, in a sense. The “undead,” demons, and their ilk usually weren’t so much defying death as continuing to exist in a different way, but a creature like Dippel was a very special, very dangerous case. Even then, it wasn’t Dippel himself that concerned Daniel as much as what he was attempting to do.</p><p>The Winchesters had been of assistance so far, destroying both the monstrous dog and the two-headed man that Dippel’s dark combination of magic and science had wrought (even if technically neither creature had been constructed by his own hand), but the brothers still hadn’t figured out that Dippel’s was the mind behind the patchwork abominations. As long as they were unaware of his identity—or for that matter, that he even existed—how could they do anything to stop him? Dippel might simply pull up stakes and move his operation somewhere else. He could be vengeful and cruel, but ultimately he was a practical man, and if it became too much trouble to continue working in Brennan, Dippel would move on. Daniel would be able to track him wherever he went, of course. The necromantic energy that Dippel gave off was like a blazing beacon to him. But the Winchesters would likely be unable to locate Dippel again, at least not without some serious effort on their part, and right now they didn’t have the time to devote to an extensive search. Daniel knew they had more pressing matters to attend to, namely Dick Roman and the Leviathan. Considering how busy the ravenous monsters had kept the world’s Reapers since their release from Purgatory, Daniel would be relieved when—or maybe that should be <em>if</em>—the Winchesters defeated the beasts.</p><p>As a Reaper, Daniel was forbidden from manifesting in the physical world, but he was permitted to communicate with the living, provided they were close enough to death to perceive him. The very old, those dying from incurable diseases, those who’d had a near-death experience and survived—he could speak to any of them, and try to convince them to act as his agent in the realm of the living. Because Sam Winchester had been infected with a necromantic taint as a result of being bitten by Dippel’s monster hound, he was dying, and Daniel hoped he would be able to communicate with the hunter soon. He would tell him, and by extension, his brother, about Dippel, and lead them to the ancient alchemist. However, it was a plan Daniel might not be able to enact. For all the battering Sam’s mind and spirit had taken, his mental defenses were still far stronger than an ordinary person’s, and his subconscious was shutting the Reaper out, denying his existence, allowing Sam only shadowy glimpses of him. As long as Sam continued to fight like this, Daniel wouldn’t be able to communicate with him. The hunter’s resistance would erode the stronger the dark taint within him became and the closer he drew toward death, but if he became too weak, there was a possibility he might die before Daniel could speak with him. He supposed he would just have to keep following the Winchesters and gamble that Sam lived long enough to help him take out Dippel.</p><p>Dippel himself might be an issue, too. Daniel wasn’t certain, but he thought Dippel might have gotten a glimpse of him while the Winchesters were battling the two-headed creature. Daniel didn’t know if the alchemist possessed the ability to perceive Reapers. He thought it a strong possibility, though, and if that was the case, if Dippel was aware that a Reaper was watching him, who knew what he might do? At the very least, Daniel would have lost the advantage of surprise.</p><p>He sighed. Sometimes working for Death could be a real pain in the ass.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“So, was I right?” Trish whispered. “Isn’t this an <em>awesome</em> place for a haunting?”</p><p>Dean had to admit, the house looked pretty damned spooky, and from the expression on Sam’s face, he knew his brother felt the same. It was located a couple miles from the cabin where Trish lived with her father, not far from a small lake. The latter had served as Trish’s excuse when she told her dad that the three of them wanted to leave the cabin.</p><p><em>I thought we could take a walk by the lake,</em> she’d said, all innocence. <em>Maybe skip some rocks or something.</em></p><p><em>No swimming,</em> her dad had said, eyeing Sam and Dean. They might be younger than Trish, but they were still boys, and it was clear that Walter Hansen didn’t like the idea of them seeing his daughter in a swimsuit.</p><p>Trish had rolled her eyes and given him a look. <em>Da-dee!</em> she’d said, drawing out the word, her voice dripping with embarrassed disapproval. She’d gotten permission, and they’d left, but their real destination had been this house.</p><p>The structure was an old two-story, the wood light gray and mottled with greenish mold and dark areas of rot, the paint long worn away by time and the elements. A section of roof had collapsed, and half of the house sagged, as if the foundation was crumbling beneath it on one side. Dean didn’t know much about architecture—okay, he didn’t know <em>anything</em> about it—but the house looked ancient, like it was built in the 1930s, and maybe even farther back than that. It was narrower than modern houses, the windows smaller, and instead of a porch it had three stone steps leading up to the front door. The steps were cracked, the door hung half off its hinges, and the windows no longer held even shards of glass. Dean was surprised the house hadn’t fallen down by now. It looked like a dilapidated house in a cartoon, the kind that barely holds together and collapses the instant a tiny bird lands on top of it. The land around the house added to its impression of age. Trees had grown up close around it, not as tall as others farther away, but tall enough to indicate how much time had passed since anyone had lived there. There was even a tree growing out of the hole in the roof. The underbrush was thick, and if there had ever been a roadway or path to the house, it was long covered over.</p><p>Yet the aura of spookiness the house exuded wasn’t due to its appearance—at least, not solely. There was a feeling in the atmosphere, a cold tingling that had nothing to do with the early spring air. It made the skin on the back of Dean’s neck crawl, and set his stomach to roiling. He remembered something important his dad had told him once.</p><p><em>You know when a place is bad, son. And I’m talking</em> really <em>bad. You can sense it, same way an animal senses danger. We’re animals, too, deep down, and we still have those instincts within us. All we have to do is listen when they try to warn us. Promise me you’ll always listen, Dean.</em></p><p>Dean had promised, and he listened now. He turned to Trish and kept his voice low as he spoke.</p><p>“Your dad may not be a hunter, but he knows plenty. Why hasn’t he ever told any of them about this place?”</p><p>“He doesn’t believe the stories people tell about this place. The old Herald House.”</p><p>“Harold?” Sam said. “Like the man’s name?”</p><p>Trish shook her head. “Herald as in ‘Hark, the herald angels sing.’ I guess it’s the last name of whoever lived here.” She shrugged. “I don’t really know.”</p><p>“What kind of stories?” Dean asked. He was beginning to fear they were in serious danger of getting in over their heads, <em>way</em> over. When Trish had told them that there was a haunted house not far from her cabin and asked if they wanted to go there and “bust some ghosts,” both Dean and Sam had agreed, trying to act as if it was no big deal, like they were veteran hunters despite their age. That was because they didn’t want to lose face in front of Trish. Dean figured the “haunted house” would turn out to be nothing but a rundown, abandoned building that kids talked about when they wanted to enjoy a shiver or two. He hadn’t expected there to be any <em>real</em> ghosts here. He knew enough about vengeful spirits—and those were the ones that usually stuck around after they died—to know that they were about as far from Casper the Friendly Ghost as it was possible to get. If they were angry enough and could muster sufficient energy, they could affect the physical world. That meant they could kill.</p><p>“A long time ago, the man who lived here killed his whole family,” Trish said. “He didn’t have any reason, at least no reason anyone was ever able to find out. One night he just went crazy, got out of bed, went downstairs, grabbed his hunting rifle, went back upstairs, and ordered his family to get up. He marched them downstairs at gunpoint—his wife, son, and daughter—and then forced them outside into the cold night. He told them he was going to hunt them, but if they could run fast enough and managed to get away, he’d let them live. They cried and begged him not to do this, but he fired his rifle at the ground near their feet to prove he was serious. They screamed and took off running.</p><p>“The man didn’t go after them right away. He wanted to give them a sporting chance. He waited five minutes or so, and then he started after them. He found his little girl first. She hadn’t gone far before climbing into a tree to hide. Most people figure her mother told her to do it because she didn’t think the girl would be able to run fast enough to get away. She was sobbing and begging for her life when her father killed her with a single shot. He found his boy next. He was running from tree to tree, trying to use them as cover. It took the man three shots before he hit his target. His wife had heard the shots and knew her children were dead. She picked up a large rock and approached her husband from behind, intending to kill him for what he’d done. But quiet as she was, he still heard her. Maybe she let out a sob just as she was about to bring the rock down on his head, or maybe she just stepped on a twig. Either way, he spun around and fired his rifle point blank at her. At the exact same moment she smashed the rock into his head. They both died. Not right away, but they were gone before the sun rose. It was almost a week before the wife’s sister got worried because she hadn’t heard from them. She and her husband came out to investigate, but there wasn’t much left of the bodies by then. The animals had picked them clean.”</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. He thought maybe the story had disturbed his younger brother, but instead of looking upset, Sam looked thoughtful.</p><p>“If the whole family died, then how does anyone know what happened?” he asked.</p><p>Dean hadn’t thought about that. He’d been too caught up in listening to the story. Still, he found himself coming to Trish’s defense, for no other reason than because he wanted her to like him. <em>Really</em> like him.</p><p>“The police probably figured it all out later,” he said.</p><p>Trish gave him a grateful smile, and Dean felt his cheeks flush. Sam scowled with obvious displeasure at his big brother having scored points with Trish.</p><p><em>Too bad you’ll never be as smooth as your big brother, Sammy-boy!</em> Dean thought.</p><p>“So where does the haunting come in?” Sam asked.</p><p>“As the years went by, people began reporting encounters with an armed man out here, and stories began to circulate that the area was haunted. People came out to investigate, and soon they began turning up dead. No one could ever locate the shooter, and eventually folks just stayed away.”</p><p><em>Too bad we aren’t as smart as them,</em> Sam thought.</p><p>“Over the years, the Herald House ghost became a local legend,” Trish continued. “Sometime in the nineteen fifties people nicknamed him the Rifleman after some old TV show, and the name stuck. Hardly anyone ever comes out this way anymore. Every once in a while a hiker or a hunter—a regular hunter, I mean—goes missing. Sometimes the body is found, sometimes it isn’t. When it is—“</p><p>“It’s got a bullet hole in it,” Dean finished.</p><p>“Usually several,” Trish corrected him. “Who knows how many people he’s killed over the years? He’s got to be stopped, and I figured since you guys have been hunting with your dad before, you could help me get rid of him.”</p><p>Dean exchanged glances with his brother. Sam had an annoying tendency to be honest at the most inconvenient times, but he said nothing now. Dean was almost disappointed. Part of him was beginning to think being here was a bad idea, and he would have liked an excuse to leave, even if it made them look like jerks in Trish’s eyes. He could have backed out on his own, he supposed, but he wasn’t the backing-out type. He was the charge-ahead-and-hope-things-didn’t-go-all-to-hell type. Especially when there was a girl involved.</p><p>“You ready?” he asked Sam.</p><p>Sam pulled a gallon-sized plastic storage bag out of his jacket pocket. It was filled with table salt. He nodded.</p><p>Dean held an iron poker he’d borrowed from Trish’s fireplace. Maybe they’d never really gone hunting with their dad, but they’d picked up a few bits and pieces of lore from him. Salt could be used to temporarily disperse a ghost. Iron did the same thing. If you could find a ghost’s bones, you could pour salt on them, set them aflame, and the ghost would be banished to wherever it was ghosts went. Dean had no idea how something so simple as a little salt and fire could do that, but if it worked, it worked, and that was all that mattered to him. He had a container of lighter fluid and some matches in his jacket pocket, so they were good to go. He hoped.</p><p>He turned to Trish. “You should probably stay behind us.”</p><p>She scowled. “Why? Because I’m a girl? I’ve got a bag of salt, too!” She removed the bag from her pocket and shook it in front of Dean’s face for emphasis.</p><p>“No, because you’ve never done this before,” he said. Although the truth was, he had wanted her to stay back because she was a girl. It was what all the tough-guy heroes in the movies did. But he could tell that wasn’t going to fly with her, so he’d go with the other excuse.</p><p>It mollified her somewhat anyway, and she nodded, although she didn’t look happy about it.</p><p>Dean and Sam stepped in front of Trish and began walking toward the Herald House. Dean made sure his younger brother stayed behind him, but as they drew closer to the front door, he couldn’t escape the feeling that he was making a terrible mistake. He was supposed to watch out for Sam. Their dad had drilled that into his head over and over throughout the years, and it had become so deeply ingrained that it went beyond a mere feeling of responsibility. It had become an important cornerstone of Dean’s identity. So what the hell was he doing leading Sam toward a house haunted by a trigger-happy ghost? Was he out of his mind? Neither of them was prepared for this, and impressing a girl—no matter how hot—was not worth putting his brother in danger.</p><p>He stopped walking and turned to face Sam and Trish. “I’m sorry, but I don’t think—“</p><p>There was a loud crash as the front door burst off its remaining hinge and flew through the air, barely missing them. Dean spun around in time to see a man walk out onto the top step. No, not walk. He emerged from the darkness within the house, pulling himself free from the shadows, almost as if they had given birth to him.</p><p>When Trish had first told them about the Rifleman, Dean had imagined the ghost as a cadaverous, chalk-fleshed scarecrow of a creature, with empty dark hollows where his eyes should be, but the man that stood on the front stoop of the Herald House looked almost disappointingly normal. He was of medium height—shorter than Dean, but a bit taller than Sam—and a paunch sagged over the front of his belt. He wore a white button shirt with the sleeves rolled up, black pants with suspenders, and black shoes. His cheeks held a touch of red, he sported a pencil-thin black mustache, and his short black hair was combed and neatly parted in the middle. It looked wet, as if he’d slicked it down with something. His face appeared human enough, all the parts present and arranged in the proper configuration. Of course, his features were contorted into a mask of raw hatred, and he carried a rifle. And there were bloodstains on his shirt... bright red, as if they were still fresh.</p><p>Despite appearances, Dean could sense right away that the figure wasn’t human. Not anymore, anyway. There was the way he’d appeared... the word manifested came to mind, but it was more than that. Dean could feel the wrongness emanating from the Rifleman, rolling off of him like waves of heat rising from coal-black asphalt in July. He was unnatural, plain and simple, his existence an insult to life itself. Dean could almost feel the woods around them drawing back from the apparition, recoiling from the presence of something worse than death.</p><p>The brothers didn’t hesitate. Dean hurled the poker at the same instant Sam flung the contents of his plastic bag. Iron and salt struck the ghost, and the Rifleman’s mouth opened in a silent scream of rage as the substance of his body dissipated into wispy shreds like fog.</p><p>Before he vanished, the ghost managed to get off a single shot, his gun booming loud as cannon fire.</p><p>Dean felt a rush of elation. They’d done it! They might not have banished the ghost for good, but they’d driven it off. Not bad for their first real hunt!</p><p>His excitement left him when he remembered the Rifleman had managed to fire his gun before disappearing. He was all right, but...</p><p>He turned to Sam, who was staring at the now empty doorway, an expression of awe on his face. “Are you okay?” Dean demanded.</p><p>Without taking his eyes off the doorway, Sam nodded.</p><p>Relieved, Dean turned to Trish. “So, what do you think about—“</p><p>He saw her lying on the ground, eyes wide and staring, the front of her sweater soaked with blood.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean sat up in bed. Darkness surrounded him, and for an instant, he didn’t know where he was. He realized he was holding something in his right hand, and it took him a second before he recognized the Colt. He must have grabbed it from under the pillow as he awoke. Damn good thing he hadn’t fired it.</p><p>He sat still for a time, skin slick with sweat, as his pulse and breathing slowly returned to normal. He could hear Sam’s breathing, slow, soft, and steady, coming from the bed next to him. He was glad he hadn’t woken his brother. As wiped out as he’d been lately, he needed all the rest he could get.</p><p>Dean remained there, thinking about Trish Hansen, until the sun rose.</p><h2><span id="chapter-10">CHAPTER 10</span><a href="#chapter-10" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam opened his eyes, yawned, and stretched. He didn’t feel rested by any means, but he didn’t feel as if he was going to slip back into unconsciousness any second either, and he figured that was an improvement. He sat up and saw Dean sitting at the table, working on the laptop.</p><p>“Maybe we should switch roles. How about you do the research from now on, and I fix cars and chase women?”</p><p>“In your dreams,” Dean muttered. He grimaced then, as if regretting his choice of words. “Coffee’s on your nightstand. It’s probably cold by now.”</p><p>“As long as it’s got caffeine, I don’t care.” Sam picked up the cup and took a sip. “How are you feeling this...” He glanced at the clock on the nightstand. 9:34. “Morning?” he guessed.</p><p>Dean nodded. “I should be asking you that question.”</p><p>“I wasn’t a snack for a two-headed energy vampire yesterday.”</p><p>“I’ve got to admit I’m dragging a little, but I’ll be okay. I figure losing life force is like losing blood. You have to give your body time to build the supply back up.”</p><p>“Yeah. You’re probably right.” Sam had gone to bed in a T-shirt and sweat pants the night before. Both he and Dean had showered before turning in, and he couldn’t smell any traces of Frankenstink in the room. Then again, his senses had been dulled lately, so the room could reek, and he might not know it. They’d stuffed their funkified clothes into a plastic garbage bag, tied it tight, and then stuffed that into another bag and tied that one even tighter. They’d then tossed the clothes into the car’s trunk. When they had time, they’d hit a coin-operated laundry, or maybe just burn the damn things and be done with it.</p><p>Sam moved to the foot of the bed and sat cross-legged while he sipped his tepid coffee. “So what game did you bring back from the darkest jungles of the Internet, oh mighty hunter?”</p><p>Dean gave him a look. “You must be feeling better if you’re cracking jokes that bad. But since you asked...” Dean entered a series of keystrokes, then turned the laptop around so Sam could see the screen. “Look familiar?”</p><p>Sam got off the bed and walked over to the table for a closer look. The image on the screen was an ink drawing of a man. Only his head and shoulders were visible, but from what Sam could see of his outfit, he guessed the man had lived in either the seventeenth or eighteenth century. The longish curled hair—which Sam thought might well be a wig—helped date the image.</p><p>“Actually, he does. That’s the guy we saw after we fought the Double-Header, right?”</p><p>The resemblance was uncanny. Aside from the hair, they could have been looking at a photograph instead of a drawing.</p><p>“You’re looking at Johann Conrad Dippel, a German theologian, physician, and alchemist, born 1673, died 1734.”</p><p>“Sounds like our guy,” Sam said. “What led you to him?”</p><p>Dean smiled. “Check out <em>where</em> he was born.”</p><p>Sam leaned closer and read the text that accompanied the image of Dippel.</p><p>“He was born at Castle <em>Frankenstein?</em> You’ve got to be kidding.”</p><p>“Nope. Turns out Castle Frankenstein’s a real place in Germany. No mad scientists lived there, though. Not unless you count our boy Dippel.” Dean leaned closer to the screen as he skim-read. “According to this, he was fond of dissecting things. He even carried out experiments to try and transfer a soul from one dead body to another. Then he wrote about it in a dissertation called <em>Maladies and Remedies of the Life of the Flesh,</em> in which he also claimed to have discovered the Elixir of Life. Eventually he set up a lab somewhere in west Germany. A local minister accused him of grave robbing, experimenting on corpses, and—naturally—consorting with the Devil. It doesn’t say if he was ever run out of town by pitchfork-wielding villagers, but it does say his ‘controversial theories’ got him banned from countries like Sweden and Russia. Historical records get patchy after that, but shortly before he died—or at least was <em>presumed</em> dead—he announced he’d discovered a potion that would make him immortal. That’s it. I’d say that makes him Suspect Number One, wouldn’t you?”</p><p>“Hell, yeah. So, what, Mary Shelley heard about Dippel and used him as inspiration for her novel?”</p><p>“That’s what the Interweb says, although it also says there’s no definite proof. But given what we’ve seen—not to mention smelled—over the last couple days, I’d say it’s a good bet.”</p><p>“So I guess, in a way, we really <em>are</em> looking for Dr. Frankenstein.”</p><p>“Pretty cool, right?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sam sipped more coffee as he mulled over the information Dean had related to him. “Any idea why an immortal German alchemist is creating monsters in modern-day Ohio?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “The cost of living is cheaper here?”</p><p>“Probably easier to keep a low profile in a small town. That way if one of your experiments breaks loose, it’s less likely to be noticed.”</p><p>“It would be kind of hard for something like Frankenmutt or the Double-Header to stroll down a street in New York without raising a few eyebrows.”</p><p>Besides, it fit a pattern Sam and Dean had become very familiar with over the years. While large cities had their share of supernatural entities, for the most part monsters and malicious spirits tended to inhabit out-of-the-way places so they could keep a low profile while hunting their prey. The Leviathan were, of course, a notable exception to this modus operandi. Given their shape-shifting abilities, they preferred to hide in plain sight.</p><p>“I don’t suppose the ‘Interweb’ said anything about how to kill an immortal alchemist,” Sam said.</p><p>“Not a word. But I figure we can try any of the standard ganking techniques, with decapitation being at the top of the list.”</p><p>“Fire might be good, too. Both Frankenmutt and the Double-Header caught fire easily enough and burned fast. Whatever Dippel did to their bodies to bring them back to life, it made them extra flammable. It stands to reason that he used a similar process to extend his own life—the same chemicals and mystic rites—and if so...”</p><p>“He’ll burn as easy as dry grass,” Dean finished.</p><p>“Let’s hope so. Now all we have to do is figure out how to find him.”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “What a name, huh? <em>Dippel.</em> Not as cool or scary as Frankenstein. Kind of dorky, actually. What are the chances the man has changed it after three hundred years?”</p><p>“You’ve seen the Frankenstein movies,” Sam said. “No matter which actor plays the doctor, what’s the one thing that always stays the same about him?”</p><p>Dean answered right away. “Ego. Frankenstein always thinks he can play God.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “A guy like that, I’m betting he’d never change his name. He’s too proud.”</p><p>“Makes sense. So, about finding him. I have an idea. Every Dr. Frankenstein needs an Igor, right? An assistant to help him carry out his unnatural experiments. I think we may have already met Dippel’s Igor.”</p><p>“Dr. Martinez,” Sam said.</p><p>“Mr. NuFlesh himself. Looks like Dippel’s decided to blend a little twenty-first-century know-how with his sixteenth-century alchemy.”</p><p>“Two great tastes that taste great together,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean raised his eyebrows. “That one wasn’t bad, Sammy. Almost made me crack a smile.”</p><p>Sam finished the last of his cold coffee. He was already starting to feel tired again. He fought back a yawn.</p><p>“Let me hit the bathroom and get ready real quick, and then we can head over to—“</p><p>The motel room spun crazily around him. The next thing he knew he was lying on his back looking up at the ceiling. Dean was patting his cheek, and not gently, either.</p><p>Sam pushed his hand away. “How long this time?”</p><p>“Too friggin’ long,” Dean growled. “I took a look at your leg while you were out. That bite wound’s not looking too good—and that’s an understatement.”</p><p>Sam glanced down the length of his body and saw that Dean had rolled up the leg of his sweat pants all the way to his knee. The skin where Frankenmutt had bit him had turned black, and dozens of ebon threads had spread out from the wound, covering that side of his leg from knee to ankle.</p><p>“You had to have seen this when you took a shower last night,” Dean said, accusation in his voice. “Unless you’re a prude who showers with his eyes closed because you’re embarrassed to see yourself naked.”</p><p>Sam struggled to sit up, and almost fell back again. He would have, too, if Dean hadn’t reached out to steady him.</p><p>“Yeah. It’s worse today, though.”</p><p>“Why the hell didn’t you say anything? I know your brains are thoroughly scrambled right now, but I refuse to believe you’ve become that stupid!”</p><p>Sam couldn’t help smiling. “For a second there, you sounded like Bobby.”</p><p>“Don’t change the subject. We’ve got to do something about this infection, or whatever the hell it is, before it—“</p><p>“Kills me?” Sam finished.</p><p>“Or turns you into something like Dippel.”</p><p>“What <em>can</em> we do? I was bitten by a monster dog created by an undead alchemist. Big Pharma doesn’t make a pill for that. Whatever this infection is, it’s at least partially magical in nature, so science alone isn’t going to cure it. If Cass was here, he could wave his hand and make me all better, but he’s not, so we’re just going to have to keep charging ahead and see what happens.”</p><p>“What <em>happens?</em> Take a real good look at your leg. I can tell you what’s going to happen—that black crap’s going to continue spreading until it covers your whole goddamned leg. And after that... well, whatever happens after that, I guarantee you neither of us is going to like it.”</p><p>“You’re just lucky the Double-Header used his hands to drain your battery,” Sam said. “If he’d bitten you, we might both be in trouble.”</p><p>“Look, forget Dippel for now. We’ll take care of him after we get you fixed up. There’s got to be something in the lore about how to counteract this. All we have to do is find it.”</p><p>“There’s only one man who understands what’s happening to me, and that’s Dippel. Once we find him, maybe he can tell us what to do to counteract the infection, and if he won’t cooperate, maybe he’ll have some notes or journals we can look through. Maybe he’s even upgraded to a computer by now.”</p><p>“Oh, he’ll cooperate all right,” Dean said. “I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p>His face was stone, his tone like ice, and Sam knew he was remembering the time he’d spent in Hell learning the secrets of torturing the damned. Dean rarely spoke of that time, and when he did, he never went into any real detail, but Sam knew his brother recalled every horrific moment he’d spent in Hell, and that included everything he’d learned there.</p><p>Sam almost felt sorry for Dippel.</p><p>He decided now wasn’t a good time to tell his brother about the other effect the... death infection, for lack of a better term, was having on him. During the battle with the Double-Header, Sam had seen shadow energy swirling around the monster’s arms as it attempted to drain Dean’s life force, but Dean hadn’t mentioned seeing that. He hadn’t seen the shadowy figure either, though he <em>had</em> seen Dippel watching them. Sam had initially thought they were hallucinations, but he’d since come to a different conclusion. He had Frankenmutt’s taint inside him now, and it had altered his perception, giving him a kind of death vision, allowing him to perceive the dark energy the Double-Header had summoned. Sam now thought the shadow figure was real, but Dean couldn’t see it. Only he could. He didn’t know what the figure was. Maybe nothing more than a local ghost drawn by the death energy released by Dippel’s creations like a moth to a flame. He supposed it was one more thing they’d have to figure out as they went.</p><p>He was afraid Dean would dismiss his death vision as another symptom of his “scrambled brains,” or worse, he’d see it as a sign the infection was more advanced than he feared. Better to keep it to himself for now, Sam decided, although he knew Dean would be pissed when the truth eventually came out. He usually was.</p><p>Dean took hold of Sam’s arm and helped him to stand.</p><p>“Does it hurt to put any weight on it?” he asked.</p><p>Sam shook his head. “Actually, it’s mostly just numb.”</p><p>“That’s not as comforting as you think it sounds. All right, you hit the john—or maybe I should say the Johann—and then we’ll go see what we can shake loose from the Phantom of the Strip Mall.”</p><p>Sam was about to chide his brother for making light of Dr. Martinez’s appearance, when his sense of smell, dulled these last couple days, suddenly kicked in. He sniffed the air and frowned.</p><p>“Do you smell smoke?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad stood in the parking lot of the Wickline Inn, no more than a dozen feet from the hunters’ door. Thanks to the gift from his lady, he had no trouble tracking them. This close, the rune engraved in his palm burned with a cold so intense it was almost unbearable. But bear it he would, for it was a boon granted to him by his dark mistress, and thus the agony was not a burden, but an honor.</p><p>He could have gone after the hunters at any time, but his long years had taught him not only the value of patience, but also of planning. So after the pair had slain Harrison’s two-headed beast, Conrad had returned to the bicycle company—a far cry from the castle where he’d been born, but serviceable enough—and proceeded to think.</p><p>He’d spent the better part of the night developing and discarding one plan after another for ridding himself of the hunters. Some plans were too complex and presented numerous possibilities for failure, others left too much to chance, while still others would draw too much attention, and that he wished to avoid at all costs. He was the closest he’d been to achieving his goal in three centuries, and he didn’t want to abandon the town, and Catherine, unless he had no other choice. In the end, as the first rays of dawn pinked the horizon, he finally decided. The plan was a simple one—which was why it had taken so long to occur to him, he supposed—but there was an elegance to it as well, along with an irony that he found as delicious as he did irresistible.</p><p>In alchemy, everything came down to the four basic elements from which all creation sprang: Earth, Air, Water...</p><p>And Fire.</p><p>He withdrew a glass vial from his jacket pocket and pried out the wax stopper. Inside was the mummified body of a tiny lizard-like creature. He’d been saving the little fellow for a special occasion, and it seemed that it had finally arrived.</p><p>He shook it out gently onto his left hand, the one unmarked by his lady. He held it up to his mouth and gently breathed on it. Instantly, its parchment-dry skin became a bright crimson, the flesh swelling with liquid, becoming soft and moist. It stirred in his palm, tiny ebon eyes blinking in the morning light.</p><p>Conrad raised the creature close to his lips once more and whispered a single word.</p><p>“Hunters.”</p><p>The salamander’s body temperature began to rise, and by the time Conrad crossed the distance to the motel room door, its heat had become almost as painful as the cold blazing from the rune on his other hand. He knelt, lowered his hand, and gently deposited the creature onto the ground. It scuttled forward and pressed its nose against the surface of the door. Conrad could feel waves of heat rolling off its body as if it were a blast furnace instead of a tiny lizard. A second later, the wood at the base of the door where the salamander’s snout touched it began to blacken and smolder, and the creature pushed itself forward, burning a tunnel as it went.</p><p>If all went as he planned, Conrad would leave with more than the satisfaction of knowing the two hunters were dead, sweet as that would be, he would have obtained the last element necessary to fulfill the promise he’d made to his dark mistress so many long years before. All he needed to do was wait and for the Reaper to make an appearance. If a couple deaths didn’t bring one of his kind out of the woodwork, what would?</p><p>Feeling more cheerful than he had in decades, Conrad whistled an old German drinking song as he withdrew to a safe distance to watch the fun.</p><p>* * *</p><p>At first Dean thought maybe Sam was beginning to hallucinate smells on top of everything else, but then he smelled it, too—and it was getting stronger. It smelled different than regular smoke, with a chemical tang that made Dean think of a combination of gasoline and sulfur. He looked around for the source, but it was Sam who spotted it first.</p><p>“Look!” Sam pointed toward the door.</p><p>Dean turned and saw a widening scorch mark at its base, wisps of smoke rising from it as if the wood was being burned from the inside.</p><p><em>What the hell?</em></p><p>As the brothers watched, scorched wood flaked away to black ash and something pushed its way into the room. At first it was covered in soot, but crimson flames flared bright, burning the black stuff into nothing, revealing the body of a small red lizard no longer than one of Dean’s pinkies. The lizard came further into the room, leaving a trail of tiny blackened footprints in the carpet.</p><p>“What’s that?” Dean asked. “A fun-sized dragon?”</p><p>“I think it’s a salamander,” Sam said, a worried tone in his voice. “And not the kind you find next to a pond. It’s a mythological creature that—“</p><p>Crimson fire burst outward from the salamander in all directions, and it scuttled toward the brothers, coming at them like a mobile campfire.</p><p>“Does that,” Sam finished.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel had been keeping an eye on the Winchesters since they’d fought the two-headed monster in the woods the day before. He’d even tried communicating with Sam that night after the brothers had showered and collapsed into bed. Given the right circumstances, Reapers could make contact with humans while they slept. The sleep state was in certain ways akin to death anyway—one of the reasons some sorcerers and psychically gifted humans were able to travel astrally while sleeping—and since Sam was already infected with the dark taint which was spreading and growing stronger with each passing hour, Daniel thought there was a good chance he might be able to contact him, or at least plant a suggestion into his subconscious. But he’d had no luck. Sam had been too weary, his slumber too deep. So Daniel had withdrawn from their room, passing silently through the door—physical barriers meant nothing to his kind—and taken up a position next to their vehicle, where he remained throughout the night. His kind did not tire, and they possessed almost limitless patience. It was a trait they shared with their master.</p><p>That morning, Daniel had sensed Dippel’s approach long before the alchemist appeared, and since he was still uncertain whether or not the man could perceive him, he retreated to the room next to the Winchesters’. He was relieved to find it empty.</p><p>He didn’t have senses, not in the way humans understood them, so he didn’t smell the wood burning, but he could detect Sam and Dean’s muffled voices, and their tone of alarm was unmistakable. Given the fact that this coincided with Dippel’s arrival, Daniel didn’t need to be a genius to know that something was wrong.</p><p>He hesitated less than a second before stepping through the wall between rooms. He emerged into the Winchesters’ just in time to hear Sam speak the word “salamander.” Daniel knew how dangerous salamanders like this—supernatural creatures of an age gone by—could be. He moved toward the creature, hoping that he would be able to reach it before...</p><p>Flames burst forth from the salamander’s tiny form, crimson, hot, and terrible to behold. Daniel knew the mystical fire could burn through anything, and nothing could extinguish it, not even a lack of oxygen. It would continue to spread, devouring everything in its path until the magic that fueled it was expended, and no power on Earth—and few powers beyond—could force it to do otherwise.</p><p>Daniel could do nothing about the flames that the creature had already kindled, but he could ensure that it generated no more. He moved past Sam and Dean, the former gasping as he saw Daniel go by, and crouched in front of the salamander. He reached through the corona of flames surrounding it—the fire feeling hot even to his fleshless substance—and touched his index finger to the lizard’s head.</p><p>A Reaper’s task was vital in a cosmic sense, but ultimately a simple one: to be present at the moment of a human’s death and serve as escort to, and if necessary, advisor about, the afterlife. Death’s servants had many supernatural abilities to help them perform their duties, and one of the simplest was also one of the most powerful: when they wished it, their touch could kill.</p><p>Despite its diminutive size, the salamander was a creature endowed with powerful magic, and it fought the Reaper’s influence, but in the end, no matter how hard the struggle, all must bow before Death. The salamander shuddered once, curled into a ball, and grew still. Its magic fled with its death, and since it was no longer protected against its own flame, it was instantly cremated.</p><p>With the salamander destroyed, there would be no new flames, but those that had already been released were spreading rapidly. Daniel knew he’d only managed to buy the Winchesters some time.</p><p>Without turning to gauge Sam’s reaction to what he had done, Daniel stepped toward the burning door and passed through it. No longer would he hide from Dippel. It was high time he did something about the alchemist. He didn’t know the full extent of the man’s dark powers, but in the end he would surely prove no match for one of Death’s chosen.</p><p>“Greetings, my friend.”</p><p>Dippel stood outside the door, as if he had been waiting for Daniel. The alchemist held a polished dark blue stone in his hand, and with a cold smile he thrust it toward Daniel. The two were so close that Dippel’s hand entered Daniel’s chest, burying the stone deep within his ethereal substance. Daniel had never known pain. If he had, he would have known that this wasn’t a pain of the flesh, a simple series of signals transmitted along a network of nerves, this was a pain of the soul, and it washed away Daniel’s very self and swept him into darkness.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Conrad held the Lapis Occultus up to his face and peered into its dark blue depths. He couldn’t see the Reaper’s spirit, of course, but he could sense its power pulsing within, and he felt a swell of triumph. He heard a woman’s voice whisper through his mind, cold as an arctic blast. <em>You have done well, my servant. Now complete the task you embarked upon so long ago.</em></p><p>Conrad was disappointed. He would rather have remained to watch the hunters burn in the salamander’s unquenchable flames. He couldn’t remember the last time he’d had the opportunity to use one of the incendiary lizards, and he’d really been looking forward to enjoying the resulting holocaust. Still, one had to tend to business before pleasure. Especially when said business was done in the name of a goddess of death.</p><p>He inclined his head. “Thy will be done, my lady.”</p><p>He tucked the Lapis Occultus—which idiot scholars had long mistakenly referred to as the Philosopher’s Stone—into his jacket pocket and headed for his car. The Lapis Occultus possessed many useful properties: turning base metals into gold, healing illness, and prolonging life. And with the right adjustments, it also made an extremely effective prison for a Reaper.</p><p>Conrad had one stop to make before presenting the Reaper’s spirit to Catherine. He needed to acquire more NuFlesh, and he owed Peter Martinez the unguent he’d promised him. Conrad Dippel was many things, almost all of them unpleasant, but a breaker of vows was not among them.</p><p>Beautiful clouds of crimson-tinged smoke billowed into the sky as he got into his car and pulled out of the motel’s parking lot. He was concerned that Martinez might be tempted to over-apply the unguent once he got hold of a fresh supply. If so, the results would be... unfortunate. Still, what did it matter? After today, Conrad would have no more need of Martinez or his NuFlesh. Soon his mistress would be free to walk the Earth, and devastation and despair would follow in her wake.</p><p>It was going to be glorious.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam didn’t know if it was his proximity to the shadow figure or the worsening of his condition, but he was able to make out some details of the being’s appearance this time. Not much, just a suggestion of body shape and facial features, enough to make him think the figure was a shadow <em>man.</em> He watched it step toward the salamander, crouch down, touch it, and then straighten and walk through the blazing door as if it and the fire that was rapidly devouring it wasn’t there. Sam wasn’t certain what the shadow man had done to the salamander, but as near as he could tell it was dead, burnt to a crisp by its own flame. The fires it had already produced continued to rage unabated, however.</p><p>The room’s smoke alarm began shrilling a high-pitched warning that was as annoying as it was unnecessary.</p><p>The door was aflame, as were the curtains around the window and the legs of the table. Sam lunged forward—nearly losing his footing thanks to his numb leg—and snatched up the laptop before the fire could claim it. Although he didn’t come in contact with any of the flames, the heat that emanated from them was intense, and his skin stung as if he’d received an instant sunburn. He stepped back, closed the laptop, and tucked it under his arm. He’d been just in time. The blazing curtains fell onto the tabletop, igniting it.</p><p>“Let’s try for the window,” Dean said. “If we break it, we can jump through. We might get a little singed in the process—“</p><p>“No good,” Sam said, shaking his head. “This is magic fire. If even a single small flame touches us, the fire will spread across our bodies until we’ve been reduced to ash!”</p><p>Sam felt as if his brain was running at near-normal speed again. Amazing how the threat of immediate incineration focused one’s concentration.</p><p>The room was rapidly filling with acrid smoke. The air had an oily texture, and breathing it in was like inhaling ground glass. Sam thought it would be a race to see which would kill them first: the flames or the poisonous smoke.</p><p>“Get your gun.” Dean ordered.</p><p>Sam didn’t question his brother. His gun was still underneath his pillow, while Dean’s rested on the nightstand next to his bed.</p><p>Gun in hand, safety off, Sam said, “Now what?”</p><p>“Motel walls are notoriously thin, right? We concentrate our fire on one spot and shoot our way through to the next room.”</p><p>“But what if someone’s—“</p><p>Dean shouted, “Look out!” and fired a round high into the wall, so if it went all the way through, the odds of it hitting anyone on the other side were small. He waited a moment, then said, “That ought to do it.” He began firing at the center of the wall between the two beds, and Sam joined him.</p><p>The Winchesters were practiced marksmen, and more importantly, they had a great deal of experience shooting under adverse conditions—like when some monster or other was trying to rip their faces off. Their aim was steady and true, and plaster flew out of the wall in large chunks. They both emptied their clips, but while they’d chewed away a good-sized hole, could even see into the next room, it wasn’t large enough to crawl through. Ammo spent, both brothers reflexively tucked their pistols into their waistbands. The gun metal was hot, but it was nothing compared to the flames at their back.</p><p>Sam could feel the flames, almost as if he was lying on a frying pan with the heat turned to high. He could almost feel his flesh back there starting to blister. He figured they had seconds left, if that, before the salamander’s fire engulfed them.</p><p>Dean rapidly cast his gaze around the room. If anyone else had been present to witness him do this, they might have thought it a sign of panic, but Sam knew his brother’s mind was working at warp speed, trying to come up with a way out. Dean usually put up a front, acting as if he was a regular everyday Joe whose most intellectual pursuit was watching foreign porn movies on pay-per-view. In reality he was highly intelligent, and a master of strategy and tactics. If anyone could find a way to escape this death trap, he could.</p><p>“Hit it!” Dean shouted.</p><p>Before Sam could ask what he meant, Dean ran toward the hole they’d shot in the wall and threw himself at it, shoulder first. He thudded against the wall in a shower of plaster and white dust, grunted, then stepped back to try again. Sam joined him this time, and after two more blows, the wall crumbled under the impact, and the two of them tumbled into the room next door.</p><p>Sam moaned. His shoulder screamed with pain, and he thought he might have dislocated it. At least he wasn’t burning to death. He gave the laptop a quick glance. He’d done his best to shield it with his body as they broke through the wall, and as near as he could tell, it had survived the trip intact. The two of them, however, were covered with plaster dust and bits of wall insulation.</p><p>He looked at Dean. “Hit it? That was your big plan? What if there’d been a support beam in the way?”</p><p>“It worked, didn’t it?”</p><p>Luckily, the room was empty. For an instant, as they broke through, Sam had feared they’d find someone there, lying on the ground, bleeding from a dozen bullet wounds.</p><p>Dean got to his feet, reached down, and helped Sam to his. Sam cradled his right arm to his chest to guard the shoulder, and looked back at the hole. The fire had spread to the rest of their room, and was already coming their way. A cloud of harsh-smelling smoke billowed through the hole, setting off the smoke alarm in the room, and Sam knew if they didn’t get out of there fast, they’d be charbroiled.</p><p>They headed for the door, opened it, and plunged into the parking lot and the blessedly smoke-free air.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean wanted to head straight for their car, hop in, and go gunning for Dippel, but Sam dissuaded him.</p><p>“We have to help get everyone to safety,” he insisted.</p><p><em>Sometimes being good guys really sucks,</em> Dean thought, but he knew Sam was right, and they spent the next fifteen minutes running around, pounding on room doors and shouting “Fire!”</p><p>They found less than a dozen people, including cleaning staff. As it was close to ten a.m., most of the Wickline Inn’s patrons had already checked out or left for the day on whatever business had brought them to Brennan. By the time a fire truck and EMT van arrived, Dean was confident that they’d managed to get everyone out of the motel and a safe distance away from the blazing structure. He and Sam watched the firefighters do what they could to put out the flames, but mere water had no effect on salamander-fire, and within a short time, the motel was nothing but a blackened, smoking ruin. One good thing: when the motel was gone, so was the fire. As Sam had predicted, once their power was spent, the flames burned themselves out. It seemed that whoever—or whatever—had created salamanders had been smart enough to realize that a creature that generated unstoppable devastating flame needed some kind of off switch. Lucky for them.</p><p>When they were certain the firefighters and emergency medical personnel had everything under control, Sam and Dean headed for the car, got in, and pulled out of the parking lot. One good thing about the place being destroyed: at least they didn’t have to settle the bill.</p><p>“I’m glad you managed to save the computer, but we lost all the other stuff we had in the room, including our extra clothes. All we got left is what we got on, which smells like smoke, and the crap we bagged up in the trunk, which smells like Frankenrot. I guess no matter what we do, we’re going to end up stinking until we can find time to hit a department store.”</p><p>“I’d rather stink than be stuck in a burn ward,” Sam said.</p><p>“No kidding.” A thought occurred to Dean. “What happened to the salamander? It looked like it died right after it burned its way into our room. Are they supposed to do that?”</p><p>Sam didn’t reply right away, and Dean wondered if his brother had slipped into another one of his mini-comas again. But when he glanced over at him, he saw his eyes were open.</p><p>“There’s something I haven’t told you.”</p><p>Dean’s stomach dropped. He hated it when Sam did this to him. Both of them had a tendency to play things close to the vest at times, but Sam was the proverbial still waters that ran deep. When he finally felt compelled to confess something, it was usually because whatever it was had gotten so bad he could no longer keep it a secret. Dean steeled himself for whatever Sam was going to say next.</p><p>“I have death vision.”</p><p>Dean stared at his brother for a long moment.</p><p>“Say what?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-11">CHAPTER 11</span><a href="#chapter-11" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>On the way to NuFlesh Biotech, Dean pulled into a coffee shop drive-thru and Sam ordered a large coffee with five shots of espresso. Then he changed his mind and got seven shots instead. Dean ordered a large pumpkin-flavored drink with whipped cream on top. When Sam raised an eyebrow at his brother’s choice of beverage, he said, “What? They only have pumpkin in the fall.” As far as Sam was concerned, Dean might as well have gotten a milkshake, but to each his own. Besides, he wasn’t one to be lecturing anyone about making healthy choices. His caffeine intake was verging on insane, and it still barely kept him functioning.</p><p>Dean had taken his revelation about possessing “death vision” fairly well, all things considered. Probably because he was planning to force Dippel to tell them how to cure the infection spreading through Sam’s body. Dean always felt better when he had a clear course of action to follow. But even though Sam had been the one to bring up the possibility in the first place, he wasn’t confident that Dippel would know of a cure, or if he did, that he’d share it with them. As old and powerful as Dippel was, they’d be lucky to kill him, and there likely wouldn’t be any time for questioning beforehand. There was a good chance this would be Sam’s last hunt, and while he had faced death on numerous occasions—even experienced it a few times—he knew this time it would stick. There was no Cass to heal him at the last minute with angelic powers, no mystic artifact, spell, or potion in their possession that could counteract the death-infection. Even if they had such an item, Sam wasn’t sure he’d want to use it. Magic that powerful came at a high cost, and it often had unexpected—and tragic—side effects. Like with Trish.</p><p><em>Sometimes death is better,</em> Sam thought. <em>A lot better.</em></p><p>* * *</p><p>The brothers shared a guest room in the Hansen cabin, just down the hall from Trish’s room, but neither of them got any sleep that night. Before, when they’d had trouble sleeping, it was because of Trish’s proximity. It was hard not to imagine her lying on her bed snuggled beneath the covers, and even harder not to wonder what she slept in, or if she slept in anything at all. But she wasn’t in her room that night, and she never would be again. Each of the boys had his own twin bed, and Sam lay on his, staring through the darkness up at the ceiling, or at least in the direction where the ceiling was. Heavy curtains blocked all light from coming through the window, rendering the room as black as the inside of a cave. Sam wondered if this was what it was like for Trish right now, surrounded by darkness and silence. Only in her case, morning would never come.</p><p>It wasn’t totally silent in their room, though. He could hear Dean breathing, and he knew from the volume and rhythm of the sound that his brother was awake. He had a pretty good idea what he was thinking, too. As the older brother, he viewed it as his responsibility to take care of Sam, and by extension, of anyone around him. He’d seen himself as the leader of their ill-fated expedition to the Herald House, and therefore responsible for how it had turned out. That meant he blamed himself for Trish’s death. Sam felt that he was equally responsible. After all, both of them had pretended that they’d gone hunting before, that they’d encountered ghosts and knew how to handle them. True, Sam had mostly kept his mouth shut while Dean lied, but he hadn’t contradicted his brother, and as far as he was concerned, that amounted to the same as lying. Some hunters they turned out to be. All they’d managed to do was dispel the ghost for a time, to wound it temporarily and make it retreat to wherever it was ghosts went when they weren’t manifesting on the material plane. It would be back, as deadly as ever.</p><p>Sam wanted to say something to make his brother feel better, or at least let him know that he didn’t blame him for what had happened, but he was afraid that anything he might say would be stupid and end up making Dean feel worse. So he lay in the dark and said nothing.</p><p>They’d carried Trish’s body back to the cabin, Dean holding her beneath the arms, Sam gripping her legs. It was the first time either of them had touched her, but Sam took no pleasure in it, and he knew Dean didn’t either. Trish was lighter than he’d expected, almost as if some part of her had departed when she died, leaving behind only an empty shell. Her father had been sitting at the kitchen table when they arrived, waiting for them, as if he’d sensed that something had happened. Something bad.</p><p>Sam and Dean carried Trish inside and laid her gently on the couch. When Walter Hansen saw his daughter’s body, the front of her sweater tacky with drying blood, he stood and stared at her for nearly five minutes without speaking. Several times Dean tried to say something, but each time Walter held up his hand to forestall him. Then without a word or even so much as a glance at either of them, he picked up his daughter, carried her out of the living room, into the kitchen, and then down into the basement. Sam and Dean trailed behind, unsure what to do. They stood in the kitchen, not daring to violate the sanctity of Walter’s workspace, which they’d never been invited into, and waited. A couple moments later, they heard the sound of Walter’s boots on the stairs. Sam had thought that this was it. Walter was going to come bursting through the door, yelling at them for having gotten his daughter killed. Then he heard the lock on the basement door engage, and a second later, Walter went back down the stairs.</p><p>Not knowing what else to do, they sat at the table and remained there until long after the sun went down. They didn’t speak, didn’t eat or drink. They didn’t do anything but sit and stare at the closed and locked basement door. Eventually, Dean stood up and headed down the hall to their bedroom, and Sam followed. They crawled into bed without brushing their teeth or anything, and they’d been lying there ever since, awake and silent.</p><p>In his mind, Sam saw the Rifleman’s horrible expression as he emerged from the darkness within Herald House, watched him raise his rifle, heard the thunderous sound of his weapon discharging. Replaying it once, twice, three times...</p><p>The next thing Sam was aware of was the smell of bacon frying, and he realized he must have fallen asleep. Some people drifted off while counting sheep, but he’d zonked out counting gunshots. If that didn’t make him a prime candidate for the funny farm, he didn’t know what did.</p><p>The room was still dark, thanks to the curtains, but he had the sense that Dean was sitting up on his bed.</p><p>“You smell that?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Yeah.” It was freaking him out, too. In the entire time they’d been staying with the Hansens, Walter had never made breakfast. Trish always had. Sometimes pancakes, sometimes French toast, sometimes eggs, but no matter what she made, she always fried bacon to go with it. Always.</p><p>“What should we do?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Check it out,” Dean answered, although he didn’t sound confident about his answer.</p><p>Sam didn’t blame him. The skin on the back of his neck was crawling, and he could feel a cold heaviness in his belly, as if he’d swallowed a hunk of lead.</p><p>Dean stood up and walked to the door, feeling his way through the dark. When he reached the door, he found the light switch and flipped it on. The overhead light came to life, and Sam squinted against its glare. He wanted to stay right where he was, but Dean was being brave, and that meant he should be brave, too—even if he didn’t want to. He climbed out of bed and joined Dean at the door. They’d both gone to bed in their clothes, so they didn’t need to change. Too bad. Sam would have appreciated any delay, no matter how small.</p><p>Both boys ran their fingers through their hair in an attempt too make it look at least a bit less mussed, and then Dean opened the door and they stepped into the hall. The smell of bacon was stronger here, and despite the situation, Sam found his mouth starting to water, and his stomach gurgled. He felt immediately ashamed. How could he be hungry after everything that had happened? But he couldn’t help it. Then Dean’s stomach rumbled, making Sam feel a bit better.</p><p>They walked down the hall into the kitchen. Walter sat at the kitchen table, sipping a mug of coffee, an empty plate before him. He looked up when they entered, and he smiled.</p><p>“Good morning, boys! Pull up a seat!”</p><p>He sounded cheerful, but his face was haggard and drawn. The flesh beneath his eyes was puffy and dark, and the lower half of his face was dotted with stubble. He didn’t smell too good, either, and he was wearing the same clothes he had on yesterday. Sam wondered when Walter’s last shower was. The man could definitely use one. But odd as it was to be greeted pleasantly by the father of a girl you’d gotten killed, odder still was the figure standing at the stove.</p><p>Sam froze when he saw her. From the back, she looked like Trish. Same height and build, same hair, same clothes she’d been wearing when they’d hiked to the Herald House yesterday. She was lifting bacon out of the frying pan with a fork and depositing it on a plate covered with a folded-over paper towel to soak up excess grease. Instead of a deep brown color, the bacon was charcoal-black, and Sam knew she—whoever she was—had burned it. When the plate was filled with bacon, she dropped the fork to the floor, as if now that she longer needed it, it had ceased to exist for her. Then she picked up the bacon plate and without bothering to turn off the burner, turned and walked toward them.</p><p>Sam’s gaze was drawn to the dark stain on her sweater first. It was dry now, and almost black, like the bacon she carried. Then he raised his eyes and forced himself to look at her face.</p><p>It <em>was</em> Trish. Her skin had a sallow cast to it, and her features were slack, utterly void of expression. And her eyes... they were wide and staring, and they looked glassy-hard, like marbles.</p><p>When Sam had been younger, he and Dean had taken a trip with their father. He couldn’t remember where to or for what reason. Just another long car ride, and another few nights in a hotel with only Dean to take care of him while their father was out doing whatever he had gone there to do. Somewhere along the way, they’d stopped for gas at a small out-of-the-way station. Sam had needed to use the bathroom, so Dean took him while their dad paid for the gas. The restrooms were located inside the station, and as Dean escorted him through, Sam was startled to see a fox standing on the counter. At first he’d thought it was real, the owner’s pet, maybe. Then after a second he saw that it stood perfectly still, and he realized it wasn’t a real fox, or rather, it had been real once, but it was no longer alive. It had been stuffed and mounted. It was kind of creepy, but also kind of cool. When he was done peeing, Sam made sure to walk by the counter so he could get a good look at the fox. Close up, he could see that some of the fox’s stitching was coming loose, and a fine coating of dust had settled onto its fur. But the worst part was its eyes. Glossy black and lifeless, they were like doll eyes, only worse, because someone had removed this animal’s real eyes and glued the fake ones into the sockets.</p><p>That’s what Trish’s eyes looked like now. Dead doll eyes.</p><p>He looked to Dean and saw his brother staring at Trish with an expression of shock. Sam was sure he looked the same. Neither of them made a move to take a seat at the table with Trish’s father.</p><p>She carried the bacon-filled plate to the table and stood there, staring off into space. She made no move to serve it.</p><p>Walter saw the brothers staring at Trish, and gave them a smile and a wink. “Where there’s a will, there’s a way—especially when you work with hunters. A lot of them can’t afford to pay me in cash, so they settle their bill the old-fashioned way: with barter. I’ve picked up all kinds of interesting objects over the years. Sometimes I sell them to hunters who can use them, but most of the time I just put them away, figuring maybe I’ll find a use for them someday.” He reached into his pants pocket, withdrew an object, and set it on the table. It was a small obsidian statue of a dog-headed man wearing an ancient Egyptian headdress.</p><p>“Recognize this fellow? It’s Anubis, the Egyptian god of the dead. He’s not much in the height department, but he kicks ass when it comes to bringing folks back from what Shakespeare called ‘the undiscovered country.’” He looked up at Trish and smiled. “Isn’t that right, sweetie?”</p><p>Trish opened her mouth as if she intended to reply, but all that came out was a thin stream of drool that fell onto the bacon.</p><p>Walter turned back to the brothers and grinned. “So, who’s hungry?”</p><p>* * *</p><p>From the outside, the NuFlesh Biotech office looked the same as it had yesterday, but as Sam and Dean got out of the car and headed for the door, it burst open and Dr. Martinez’s office assistant came running out. The slender woman looked absolutely terrified, and without realizing where she was going, she ran directly into Dean. She didn’t have a lot of meat on her, and the collision sent her stumbling backward as if she’d run full force into a brick wall. Dean managed to reach out and grab her arms in time to stop her from falling on her bony posterior.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” he asked. “Has something happened?”</p><p>He groaned inwardly. He hated it when people in horror movies asked stupid questions like that. <em>Of course</em> something had happened! Why else would she be running as if she had a pack of Hellhounds on her tail?</p><p>At first her gaze refused to focus on either Dean or his brother, and her lower lip kept quivering. He was beginning to fear that she’d taken the last exit to Loonyville, but then she spoke.</p><p>“It’s Doctor Martinez. He’s... he’s not well.” She tore free from Dean’s grip with surprising strength for such a petite woman and ran into the parking lot. If she had a car there, she didn’t bother with it. She just kept going until she reached the sidewalk and was gone.</p><p>“I’d say that definitely qualifies as a bad sign,” Dean said.</p><p>“You think?”</p><p>The brothers drew their pistols—both weapons reloaded and ready to go—and entered NuFlesh.</p><p>The reception area was empty, which made sense, as its usual sole occupant had just high-tailed it for the hills. Dean held up his hand for Sam to stop for a moment, and the two of them listened. At first Dean didn’t hear anything, but then he was able to make out a voice singing softly.</p><p>“The worms crawl in, the worms crawl out, the worms play pinochle on your snout.</p><p>“That’s a little creepy,” Dean whispered.</p><p>“More than a little,” Sam replied.</p><p>Together the brothers headed down the hall toward Martinez’s office. The singing grew louder the closer they got, the same phrase, repeated over and over in a childish singsong tone. Martinez’s door was half open, and Dean debated the merits of calling out to the doctor or going in silent, guns at the ready.</p><p>He didn’t have to make the choice, as the door opened the rest of the way and Martinez stepped into the hall. He stopped when he saw the Winchesters. If he noticed they’d drawn their pistols, it didn’t seem to bother him.</p><p>“Hello, agents! I didn’t expect to see you again so soon. What can I help you with?” His voice was a thick, liquid burble, almost impossible to understand.</p><p>Dean and Sam could only stand and stare. They’d seen some genuinely awful things in their lives, but this qualified for the top ten, easy.</p><p>Martinez’s skin had taken on a bright pink color that reminded Dean of the nasty slime fast-food burgers were made from, and it sagged from his bones like melting wax. The flesh had drawn away from his eyes and mouth, giving his face a skull-like aspect, and his hair had slid down the left side of his face like a toupee that refused to stay put. His ears dangled from thin pink strands that hung from his head like braids, and his fingers stretched all the way to the floor. The flesh from his legs had run out of his pants cuffs to overflow his shoes, making it look as if he had thick pink stumps instead of feet. His chin had become a long tendril that stretched past his chest and wobbled horribly when he spoke.</p><p>Dean turned toward his brother. “Sam, remember when I said this job reminded me of <em>Frankenstein?</em> I changed my mind. We are way into <em>Reanimator</em> territory here!”</p><p>Martinez went on as if Dean hadn’t spoken. “I hope you haven’t come for any samples of NuFlesh to compare with what you found on that nightmarish beast you showed me yesterday.” He spoke almost cheerfully in his burbling voice, as if nothing was wrong. “I’m afraid I traded the last of my supply to a special customer of mine. He provides me with a special unguent that relieves the itching caused by my burn scars and—“</p><p>That was the last word Martinez got out before his lower jaw detached from his skull and tumbled to the floor. It landed with a plop in the widening pool of pink goo that spread outward from his feet, and Sam and Dean scooted back to avoid contact with the disgusting substance. Dean had seen the <em>Blob</em> movies, and he knew how dangerous nasty goo could be. Pinkish slime continued running from Martinez’s skeleton, flowing like syrup, and individual bones came loose without muscles, ligaments, or cartilage to hold them in place. His form began to lose shape and fold in upon itself, though his eyes remained unaffected, darting back and forth in confusion, as if he’d finally come to realize that something was terribly wrong but wasn’t able to determine what. Then Martinez lost what little solidity remained to him, and his skeleton collapsed, leaving nothing but a pile of bones, his clothing, and a mound of watery goo. Only his eyes remained, housed in the skull, which sat lopsided atop the pink mound. They looked up at Sam and Dean, whatever emotion they might have held unreadable, until at last they too melted away to nothing.</p><p>“I’m never going to eat ice cream again,” Dean said. “Or chew bubble gum.”</p><p>Sam looked as if he might lose the gallon or so of coffee he’d drunk so far that morning. “I’m right there with you, brother.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“I’ve been using the basement as a lab for weeks now, and I still haven’t gotten used to how chilly it is down here. Sometimes I feel as if I should be wearing a parka instead of a lab coat. But the cold’s good for you, isn’t it, sweetie?”</p><p>She smiled down at her daughter. Bekah lay naked on the table, a white sheet covering her from the neck down. Even though it was just the two of them, Catherine wanted to give Bekah her dignity. Catherine might be her mother—not to mention a doctor—but Bekah was a teenager, nearly an adult, and her body was her own. The last thing Catherine wanted to do was treat her like a piece of meat.</p><p><em>Like you treated that poor dog?</em> she asked herself.</p><p>That was different. That creature was a test subject, its only purpose to help Catherine determine how effective NuFlesh—with Conrad’s special “enhancements”—was at fusing body parts from different donors. Both Bekah and Marshall’s bodies had suffered severe damage in the accident, and it had been necessary to replace numerous organs, tissue, and in a couple cases, entire limbs. A good half of Bekah’s face had needed reconstruction, and only one of her original blue eyes remained to her. The other was now brown. Beneath the sheet, her body was crisscrossed by faint scar lines of NuFlesh indicating where Catherine had operated on her. She’d taken far more care with Bekah than she had with the dog, so the scars were hardly noticeable. She’d been even more careful with her daughter’s face, working diligently to ensure that the skin looked as smooth and natural as possible. When Bekah was... well again, Catherine wanted her to like what she saw in the mirror.</p><p>During the last few weeks Catherine had often felt more like a sculptor than a doctor, though with her medium being flesh instead of clay. Conrad had encouraged her to view her work that way.</p><p><em>We want strong, healthy bodies for your family,</em> he’d once told her. <em>That is, of course, the ultimate goal. At its best the human form possesses an elegance and beauty unrivaled in nature. So we want to make sure that not only are your loved ones restored to life, but that the bodies that house that life are worthy of the gods themselves.</em></p><p>Conrad often spoke like that, almost as if he was a poet instead of... whatever he was. Catherine didn’t see her work in such lofty terms, but she wanted Bekah and Marshall to be comfortable with their restored bodies, wanted them to be able to go out in public without drawing attention. Simply put, she wanted them to be as normal as possible, given the circumstances. She certainly didn’t want them to turn out to be freakish monstrosities, like the dog. But then, she hadn’t been concerned with aesthetics when she’d made it, only in testing the efficacy of NuFlesh. And, of course, in proving that Conrad’s resurrection techniques worked.</p><p>At least she didn’t have to worry about the dog anymore. Conrad had let her know that the beast had been disposed of. He’d provided no details, and she’d asked for none. One of the key aspects of their working relationship was that she didn’t press him for information, and he didn’t tell her things that she’d prefer not to hear. It was better that way.</p><p>Bekah’s long hair was a deep rich brown, and Catherine loved to brush it. The action reminded her of when Bekah had been a child, unable—or truth to tell, unwilling—to brush her own hair. Even when Catherine had finally managed to get the girl to go into the bathroom and brush, she always “forgot” to do the back, leaving it to Catherine to finish the job. Bekah had grown out of that phase eventually, and Catherine had been surprised to find herself missing it. She’d enjoyed the sweet intimacy of touching her daughter’s hair, of running the brush through it, of chatting with Bekah about this and that while she worked.</p><p>She was tempted to get a brush and spend a few minutes grooming Bekah’s hair now, but she resisted. She hadn’t removed Bekah from the freezer and laid her out on the table so she could play Mommy. She had work to do. She’d begin with the head.</p><p>Many were the wonders that Conrad had shown her during the course of their collaboration, and although she was a rational woman, she had come to believe that there was, if not magic in the world, far more to science that she’d ever suspected. One of the most amazing things he had taught her was the formula for creating a chemical mixture that could reverse the cellular damage caused by decay. In and of itself it did not restore life, but it prevented dead bodies from rotting, which given the amount of time Catherine had needed to have Bekah and Marshall out of the freezer and on the table so she could work with them, was vital. However, the treatment wasn’t permanent, and when it wore off, not only did decay return, it did so with a vengeance, accelerating exponentially until the subject was nothing but a fleshless skeleton, as she’d learned from observing numerous test subjects. Rats, mostly, and in one case, a stray cat Conrad had brought her. The results of accelerated decay were unpleasant to observe, to say the least, and it was a fate she was determined to avoid for her husband and daughter. So every few days Catherine checked Bekah and Marshall to make sure they hadn’t begun to actively decay once more. If she’d had an unending supply of the treatment, she’d use it on them every day, but the ingredients weren’t easy to come by, and the process for creating the mixture was quite involved. A mistake at any step along the way would render the result useless. So Catherine made sure to employ the treatment only when it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>The results were almost beyond belief. When Bekah had been little, many was the time that Catherine had crept into her room at night, ostensibly to check and make certain she was all right, but in reality because she simply loved watching her daughter sleep. She was always so still—no restless sleeper, she—and her breathing was so gentle that Catherine had to lean down close to hear it. Now, looking at Bekah lying on the table, her features awash in the harsh glow of fluorescent light, Catherine had no trouble imagining that she wasn’t dead, that she was merely sleeping as sound as ever, waiting for her mother to rouse her.</p><p>In a way, she supposed that was true.</p><p><em>Enough woolgathering.</em> She had work to do. She began her examination with Bekah’s feet.</p><p>She lifted the sheet and began searching for any discoloration on the skin. Finding none, she drew the sheet back further and moved on to the legs. She was in the process of examining the torso when she heard footsteps on the kitchen floor overhead. Conrad had arrived.</p><p>She rearranged the sheet to cover her daughter’s body once more, then leaned close to Bekah’s ear and whispered, “Don’t worry. I know you don’t like it when he looks at you. We’ll finish the examination later, when he’s gone.”</p><p>She heard the basement door open, and she straightened and took a step back from the table. She saw nothing wrong in talking to her daughter, but she never did so in front of Conrad. She wasn’t worried that he’d think her crazy. He was a bit odd himself, to put it mildly. But her conversations with Bekah—one-sided though they might be—were private, meant to be kept between mother and daughter.</p><p>He came down the stairs, moving gracefully despite being burdened with a large cardboard box. It looked as if it was heavy, but he carried it with ease. She wasn’t surprised. She’d long known he was stronger than he looked.</p><p>“More supplies?” she asked.</p><p>Conrad reached the basement floor and walked to one of the counters where he set the box down on one of the few empty spaces to be found. He removed his lab coat from the hook on the wall where it had been hanging, slipped it on over his suit jacket, and then joined Catherine by Bekah’s side.</p><p>“More NuFlesh,” he said. “We’re going to need it.”</p><p>“Good.” She’d finished restoring Bekah’s body for the most part, but there were still a few things she wanted to do to Marshall’s. Then she frowned. “Wait, what do you mean, ‘We’re going to need it’? You sound as if you have something special in mind.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. She disliked it when he did that. He had a habit of giving her a smile that she imagined a cat might show to a small rodent an instant before pouncing.</p><p>“I do indeed! Feast your eyes, my dear, upon <em>this.”</em> He removed a small object from his jacket pocket and held it out for her inspection.</p><p>At first, it didn’t look like much to her. It was an oblong stone of deep blue, its surface polished smooth. Then she realized that instead of catching and reflecting the light, the stone seemed to absorb it, and not gently. It grabbed hold of the light and dragged it down into whatever untold depths lay within.</p><p>She blinked. For a moment, she’d felt almost hypnotized by the stone, and it took an effort to tear her gaze from it and focus on Conrad once more.</p><p>“What is it?” She kept her tone neutral, but inside she was burning with excitement. She could sense the power the stone exuded, and she knew that Conrad had indeed brought her something special today. Very special.</p><p>“It’s called the Lapis Occultus,” he explained. “A token of great power.”</p><p>“Can I... hold it?” She was almost afraid to ask. The longer she looked at the stone, the less distinct its outline became, as if it radiated some kind of energy that distorted the air around it.</p><p>“Of course.” He held it out to her, and she took it with trembling hands. It was then she caught a glimpse of Conrad’s right palm and saw the black X marring the flesh.</p><p>She frowned. “What happened to you?”</p><p>“It’s nothing of consequence. The materials we work with can be dangerous, as you well know, and I wasn’t as careful as I should have been. It will heal in due course.”</p><p>The symmetrical shape of the mark made it look deliberate. If the affected area hadn’t been raised, she might’ve thought it was a tattoo.</p><p>Before she could think on the matter further, her attention was drawn back to the object she held. The Lapis Occultus, Latin for dark stone.</p><p>It was cool to the touch, and seemed to almost vibrate in her hand, as if it was charged with power. In fact, the longer she held it, the more she had the sense that it was somehow alive. She thought she could even hear a voice, so faint it was almost imperceptible, calling to her as if from a great distance. A man’s voice, she thought, but she couldn’t make out what it was saying.</p><p>Conrad took the stone from her hand, and the voice was cut off. Catherine felt momentarily disoriented, as if she’d just awakened from a dream. She shook her head as if to clear it. No doubt about it, she needed to get more rest.</p><p>She forced herself to look away from the stone and meet Conrad’s gaze. “What does it do?”</p><p>“It is the final piece of the puzzle, Catherine. With it, we can ensure that your husband and daughter’s bodies will be completely resistant to decay once they are resurrected.”</p><p>She stared at the stone in Conrad’s hand, unable to believe what she’d heard. The problem of decay was the one impediment to successful resurrection of the dead. You could restore them to life, even create a new being from separate parts, but regardless of how careful you were, the resurrected would eventually begin to decay, sometimes sooner, sometimes later, but it was inevitable. She had observed this in one test subject after another. It was almost as if they had a force eating them away from the inside. The effect was more pronounced when pieces from separate donors were joined, most likely due to tissue rejection. NuFlesh helped slow the process of decay a great deal, but it could only forestall it so long.</p><p>If the Lapis Occultus could do what Conrad claimed, then there was no reason to wait any longer. They could begin resurrecting Bekah and Marshall right away! But if the stone didn’t function as Conrad promised, she would be restoring her husband and daughter to life only to condemn them to a slow, painful second death.</p><p>“I can see the hesitation on your face,” Conrad said. “When I first came to you, you were skeptical of what I claimed I could do, but have I not proved myself to you time and again? I know to one such as yourself, schooled in the ways of modern science, the Lapis Occultus must appear to be nothing more than a mere gem. Pretty enough, but certainly not capable of performing miracles. Yet you held it in your hand, Catherine. <em>You felt</em> its power. You cannot deny the evidence of your own senses.”</p><p>She had felt the stone’s power. She didn’t understand it, but she knew it was real. And Conrad had been able to deliver on every promise he’d made so far, no matter how impossible it might have seemed at the time. Surely he’d earned her trust by now. Beyond all that, though, was the fact that she missed Marshall and Bekah so very much. They’d been separated too long. It was high time they were a family again.</p><p>“All right.” Now that she’d accepted the Lapis Occultus as genuine, she could feel her excitement rising. “Bekah’s body is complete, and she’s already on the table. I’ll give her a thorough examination to make sure she’s ready and then—“</p><p>“Perhaps we should begin with your husband.”</p><p>Catherine had already turned toward Bekah, intending to get to work right away, but Conrad’s words stopped her. She turned to look at him, frowning. “Marshall isn’t ready. He still needs a few finishing touches. Bekah—“</p><p>Conrad stepped forward and reached out to touch Catherine’s arm. Even through the sleeve of her lab coat and the sweater beneath, she could feel how cold his hand was.</p><p>“I understand your eagerness to proceed, and in my own way I share it.”</p><p>There was something in his tone of voice that made Catherine think there was a hidden meaning to the last part of his statement, but Conrad went on before she could consider it further.</p><p>“I have every confidence that the Lapis Occultus will function properly, but I must admit that I have never used it before. Not in this way, at least. I think it might be prudent to test it first.”</p><p>“You want to use <em>Marshall</em> as a test subject?” The thought horrified her.</p><p>“If he was alive, and this were a more... mundane medical procedure that both he and your daughter needed, a procedure that carried with it a certain amount of risk, what do you think he would do?”</p><p>Catherine knew exactly what her husband would do. The same as she would under similar circumstances.</p><p>“He’d insist on going through the procedure first to make sure it was safe.”</p><p>Conrad’s face betrayed no reaction to her words, but she felt a sense of satisfaction from him, as if he’d won an important battle.</p><p>“How long do you anticipate it will take to ready your husband’s body for the procedure?”</p><p>She considered. “All the major organs are in place and properly connected. The nervous system could use more tweaking, but it’s essentially finished. Really, all that’s left are mainly cosmetic touches. The nose isn’t as straight as I’d like, he’s still missing several teeth—and there’s the tongue, of course. That’s what will take the most time. But with the new... donations you acquired the other night, along with a fresh supply of NuFlesh, I’d say Marshall could be ready to go in two, maybe three hours.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Excellent. Shall we begin?”</p><h2><span id="chapter-12">CHAPTER 12</span><a href="#chapter-12" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>After Dr. Martinez had, as Dean put it, turned into a “soft nougaty center,” the brothers split up and searched through the NuFlesh offices, looking for any clue to the location of Conrad Dippel’s home base. As they moved from room to room, they had to be careful not to step in Martinez’s liquefied remains pooling in the hall, which were beginning to smell almost as bad as Frankenmutt’s. When they were finished, the brothers compared notes in the reception area.</p><p>“There was nothing on Martinez’s computer or in his desk,” Sam said. “He left his phone in his office, but there was no number or address in it for Dippel. No texts or emails, either.”</p><p>“Same with Ms. Speedy Gonzalez,” Dean said. “Both her computer and desk were fresh out of Dippel, too. Did you see anything with your, uh, death vision?”</p><p>Dean still didn’t know how he felt about Sam’s latest revelation. If it was true, it meant that his brother’s infection was worse than he’d suspected. If it wasn’t true, it meant that his hallucinations were starting up again. Hell, it could be both: the infection might be causing such a strain on his system that it was provoking hallucinations. That was the thing about being a hunter. When you lived in a world where the impossible not only existed, it wanted to tear your throat out and feast on your insides, real was a slippery concept at best.</p><p>“I found this in his office trash.” Sam held up an empty glass vial. The inside of the glass contained residue of some thick, greenish-yellow substance.</p><p>“Dippel’s special unguent,” Dean said, then frowned. “What the hell is an <em>unguent</em> anyway?”</p><p>“Kind of like a medicinal cream,” Sam said.</p><p>“Looks more like snot. Can you imagine the TV commercial for that stuff? ‘Side effects may include sudden goo-ification.’” He paused as a thought occurred to him. “You think maybe Dippel messed with the formula to make sure it killed Martinez?”</p><p>“Maybe, but why would he off the only supplier of NuFlesh in the world?”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “Maybe he’s learned how to make it for himself. Or maybe he just doesn’t give a damn. He <em>is</em> an immortal psychopath, after all.”</p><p>“I suppose. But it could’ve been an accident, too. Maybe Martinez used more than the recommended dose.”</p><p>“If that’s the case, then given what happened to him, I’d say he used <em>way</em> more.”</p><p>“So what do we do now?” Sam asked. “Go check out Martinez’s home, see if there’s any info on Dippel in his home computer?”</p><p>“I doubt he’d have Dippel’s address stuck to his refrigerator door. Whatever we do, we’d better step on it. Once the local police see Martinez’s remains—such as they are—they’re going to freak. They’ll put another call into the CDC, maybe even fax some pictures of Martinez’s bones-and-pink-goo-stew, and once that happens...”</p><p>“Brennan will be crawling with CDC personnel.”</p><p>Dean nodded. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they dropped a giant plastic dome over the whole damn town. If the CDC shows up in force, Dippel will go to ground or get the hell out of Dodge. Either way, we’ll have a tough time finding him after that.”</p><p>Sam yawned. “We could get rid of the goo, so there’s nothing for the police to find.”</p><p>“Now I know you’re half asleep. You’d never suggest anything that stupid when you’re on your game.” Dean started counting points off on his fingers. “For one thing, I’m not touching what’s left of Martinez. We don’t know just how toxic that goo is. For another, even if we could find a safe way to move that crap, it’ll still leave residue for the cops to find, and the CDC after them. And remember, the receptionist saw Martinez when he was in the process of melting, so we could only conceal what happened to him for so long. Hell, she may have already reported his condition to the cops. So, if we move Martinez’s goo-mains and the cops find out, they’re going to start thinking some kind of conspiracy’s going on in their town, which could end up bringing in the real Feds, or maybe Homeland Security. Either way, the heat would get turned up real high, real fast.”</p><p>“Yeah. I see what you mean. Sorry.” Sam stifled another yawn.</p><p>Dean was really starting to get worried. If Sam’s infection continued spreading, his reflexes could be dulled to the point where he might not be able to defend himself in a fight. After that, how much longer would it be before he didn’t have enough energy to move? He might even slip into a coma. They needed to track down Dippel if they were to have any hope of finding a cure for Sam’s condition. Otherwise, Dean was afraid his brother wasn’t going to make it. Dean wasn’t about to let that happen. They’d been through too much together—life and death, Heaven and Hell, and everything between. Dean wasn’t going to let his brother down. He’d die—again—first.</p><p>“Maybe Dippel has another Igor,” Sam said.</p><p>Dean had been so caught up in his thoughts that Sam’s words didn’t register with him at first. “What?”</p><p>“Martinez supplied Dippel with NuFlesh, and in turn Dippel gave him the anti-itch cream. Martinez described it as a trade, which suggests it wasn’t a medical collaboration. If Dippel had help making his creations, he probably wouldn’t go to a biochemist anyway. He’d want someone with a medical background. A physician or maybe even a veterinarian.”</p><p>Dean smiled. “Maybe you’ve still got a few functioning brain cells left after all. But if there is another Igor, how do we find him or her? We can’t just look up every doctor in the Brennan area, drop by their office, and say, ‘Excuse me, but have you built any monsters out of dead body parts lately?’”</p><p>“Dippel would need to find someone shady to work with, someone he could blackmail, if necessary. We need to find out if there are any doctors or vets in town who’ve got a sketchy reputation, maybe even been in trouble with the law.”</p><p>“Looks like we need to pay a visit to Brennan’s finest,” Dean said. They’d already spoken to the sheriff when they’d first begun investigating the strange deaths in town. They could easily claim they’d returned to follow up on some unspecified leads they’d gathered. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Dean started toward the door, but before he reached it, Sam said. “On the way, can we—“</p><p>Dean sighed. “We’ll stop for coffee, don’t worry.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>“What do you think she’s doing? Is she sleeping or just lying awake and staring at the ceiling?”</p><p>Dean didn’t want to talk about it. He kept his mouth shut and hoped Sam would do the same. They were in their room at the Hansens’ cabin, Sam sitting cross-legged on his bed, Dean sitting on the floor, his back against the wall, legs stretched out in front of him. There was a lamp on top of a dresser between their beds, and the light was on. Neither brother had said anything, but they didn’t want to be in the dark, not with Trish—or whatever she’d become—in the house. Dean had also locked their door. He had no idea if it would keep Trish out if she wanted in, but even a little protection was better than none at all.</p><p>“What do you think she is?” Sam asked. “Is she a zombie?”</p><p>“Zombies are made by voodoo,” Dean said in a tone that indicated this was the most obvious thing in the world. “You saw that little statue her dad had. It was Egyptian.”</p><p>“So she’s like a mummy, only with no bandages?”</p><p>“I don’t know <em>what</em> she is!” Dean snapped. Sam recoiled as if he’d been struck, and Dean felt instantly ashamed. Sam was scared, that’s all. Truth was, so was he. When he spoke again, he did so quietly, in a voice that was little more than a whisper. “Whatever she is, she’s not Trish anymore.”</p><p>The day had been one of the most bizarre that Dean had experienced, and given his dad’s job, that was saying something. Trish hadn’t spoken a single word, and her face never displayed emotion—or any expression at all, for that matter. At first, Dean had thought she didn’t blink anymore, but after a while, he realized she did, only far more slowly than a normal person. He’d read somewhere that people blink an average of once every five seconds. Trish blinked once every minute. She didn’t move much, only when her dad asked her to do something. When she did move, she did so with precise, economical motions, like a machine that had been programmed for maximum efficiency. When she wasn’t doing anything, she was so still she might have been a wax figure created in the image of the real Trish. And she never sat. She always stood, and if she was in the way, you had to go around her. Not only didn’t she step aside, there was nothing in her eyes or expression to indicate that she was even aware of another presence.</p><p>Walter Hansen didn’t seem to notice that there was anything wrong with his daughter. Dean had heard the phrase “in denial” before, but this was the first time he’d seen it in action. Normally, Walter spent most of the day down in his workshop, preparing documents for his clients, but today he remained upstairs, keeping up a running one-sided conversation with Trish. He spoke about things they had done back when her mother was alive, holidays they’d celebrated, trips they’d taken... He spoke about plans for the future, too. Places they’d never gotten around to visiting that they’d go to soon, renovations he wanted to do to the cabin, changes he wanted to make in their lives. Maybe they’d get a cat or a dog. Trish had always wanted a dog, hadn’t she?</p><p>Trish stood there, motionless, never speaking. Dean had no idea if she heard her father’s words, or if she did, if she understood them.</p><p>Whatever command Walter gave her, she obeyed, and after having her make breakfast, he had her do a series of chores around the cabin. She ran the sweeper, dusted, and did several loads of laundry, and all the while Walter followed her around, talking. In the afternoon, Walter had the four of them sit down and watch TV. Well, three of them. Trish remained standing. Walter put on a rerun of an old sitcom, and he joined in with the laugh track, laughing loud, as if the show—which Dean had seen before and didn’t think was all that funny—was the most hilarious thing he’d ever viewed. There was an edge of hysteria to Walter’s laughter that Dean found just as creepy as Trish’s immobile, stone-faced presence, and after a while he couldn’t take it anymore. He told Walter that he and Sam were going to go out and gather some firewood, despite the fact that there was a healthy supply already stacked up next to the cabin, and Walter said, “Sure, sure. Good idea.” He didn’t take his gaze off the TV screen as he answered, and Dean and Sam lost no time in getting the hell out of there.</p><p>They didn’t bother pretending to get firewood. Instead, they wandered through the woods around the Hansens’ cabin, not speaking, just walking. Each alone with the guilt that was eating them up from the inside.</p><p>They stayed out past dinner—no way did they want to suffer through another meal prepared by maybe-a-zombie, maybe-something-else Trish—and they finally came in around nine. They went straight to bed, but before they could hole up in their room, Walter told them to make sure they got a good night’s rest.</p><p>“Tomorrow we’ll go fishing at the lake,” he said. “Then later, we’ll head into town for ice cream and a movie. How does that sound?”</p><p><em>Like a nightmare,</em> Dean had thought. “Sounds good,” he’d said. Then he and Sam hurried to their room, closed the door, and locked it.</p><p>That had been two hours ago. For most of that time the boys had remained silent, listening to the drone of Walter’s perpetual one-sided conversation with his undead daughter. Eventually, Walter decided to go to bed, but not before leading Trish to her room, and—Dean presumed—tucking her in. He wondered if Walter gave her a goodnight kiss, maybe on the forehead, maybe on the cheek. If so, did her skin feel normal, or was it cold and waxy? The thought made him shudder.</p><p>“What are we going to do?” Sam asked in a small voice.</p><p>This was the question Dean had been dreading all day. He was the older brother, and with their dad away, it was only natural that Sam would look to him for guidance in this situation. It was his responsibility to look after his brother—as their father had made abundantly clear to him on many occasions. He had nearly failed in that responsibility yesterday, when he’d been dumb enough to lead Sam to the Herald House. He’d thought he was so smart, that he was a big-time hunter, just because he’d picked up one or two things from listening to his dad. Trish had paid for his arrogance with her life, but it could’ve just as easily been Sammy who’d taken a spectral bullet to the heart.</p><p>Once, in some hotel room or other, when Sam had been asleep, their father had turned to Dean and said, “Son, there’s not a lot of advice that I can pass along to you about life. Real life, I mean. Not the kind of life hunters lead. But I know this: never let the little head do the thinking for the big head.”</p><p>That had been a few years back, and Dean hadn’t been exactly sure at the time what his dad had been trying to tell him. But he understood now. Boy, did he understand! Everything that had happened had been his fault, and all because he’d wanted to act like a big man and impress a girl. An amazing girl who had died and been brought back to some grotesque semblance of life by her grief-stricken, and more than a little crazy, father.</p><p>Dean didn’t know if he believed in souls. He knew ghosts were real, and if he hadn’t known it before, he surely would have after the previous day’s encounter with the Rifleman. But he thought ghosts might not be the consciousness of a person that continued to exist after death so much as some kind of psychic energy that was left behind. Energy that took on the shape and behavior of the person who created it, but wasn’t literally that person. If that was true, then Trish—her mind, her spirit, her essence—hadn’t been brought back, only her body. She was an empty shell, little more than a puppet for Walter to command. If there were souls, though, then it was possible that Trish’s had returned with her physical form, but was trapped within, unable to do more than passively observe, a prisoner in her own body. <em>It would be,</em> Dean thought, <em>the very definition of a living hell.</em> And it was all his fault.</p><p>“The first thing we do,” he told Sam, “is find some weapons.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>They moved silently through the cabin. Both Walter and Trish’s bedroom doors were closed, but Dean knew that didn’t mean either of them was asleep. Especially Trish. It was very possible that she didn’t need to sleep anymore, that she was—as Sam had said—just lying on her bed, eyes open and staring, blinking only once per minute.</p><p>They entered the kitchen, and each selected a large knife from the block on the counter. They searched through the drawers, careful to open and close them slowly so as not to make the contents rattle, but all they found were a couple screwdrivers in a junk drawer. Dean took the Phillips, Sam the flathead. What Dean really wanted to find was a gun. Their dad had made sure that both of them knew how to shoot, and even if neither of them was a highly skilled marksman, they could do more than merely hit the broad side of a barn. If they found more than one gun, Dean wouldn’t have let Sam carry one, though. Sam was an okay shot, if not as good as him yet, but if their dad ever found out he let Sam use a gun without his express permission... Well, Dean would rather face an entire town full of vengeful ghosts than John Winchester when he was angry.</p><p>“Should we go down into the basement and look?” Sam asked. “If Walter has any guns, he might keep them down there.”</p><p>Dean found himself feeling proud of his little brother. He was obviously scared, but not only was he keeping himself together, he was thinking strategically. Dean knew Sam was smart—smarter than him, that was for sure—but sometimes he forgot just how smart.</p><p>Dean thought it over. If Walter sometimes let hunters pay him in trade, he probably did have a few guns somewhere, and his workshop seemed like a logical place to keep them. He could have other things down there, too—items more powerful and dangerous than firearms. He’d said the Egyptian statue he’d used to bring Trish back had come from one of his clients. He might have other magical objects in the basement, maybe even something that could reverse the spell that had resurrected Trish.</p><p><em>Don’t be an idiot,</em> Dean told himself. <em>It’s not like any items Walter has will be labeled and come with a set of instructions.</em> If Walter did have any more magic goodies downstairs, they would be extremely dangerous to use, assuming he and Sam could even get them to work in the first place. They were better off sticking with simple weapons, ones that wouldn’t backfire and turn you into a pile of ash, or worse. But they really could use a gun. Dean didn’t know what sort of creature Trish had become, but he figured that they should avoid getting too close to her. He’d seen <em>Night of the Living Dead</em> maybe a dozen times, and the last thing he wanted was for Trish to sink her teeth into either him or Sam and turn them into flesh-eating zombies. Knives and screwdrivers were only good for close-up fighting, but with a gun, they could deal with her from a distance.</p><p><em>Listen to you! You’re thinking about killing a girl you had the hots for yesterday!</em></p><p>Dean thrust the thought away. He’d learned from watching his father that sometimes a hunter had to put his emotions aside in order to get the job done. Despite the fact that they were in this situation because of his screw up, he was determined to live up to his father’s example and do the job right.</p><p>“Okay, let’s go check the basement. But we’ve got to be quick. There’s no telling—“</p><p>He broke off as he heard sounds come from down the hallway: a soft creak followed close by another, and that followed a muffled click. Dean felt his gut turn to ice.</p><p>“Trish left her room,” Sam whispered, “and went into Walter’s.”</p><p>That’s exactly how Dean saw it. No time to look for guns now.</p><p>They left the kitchen and hurried down the hallway, Dean’s instincts screaming for him to move faster. They carried their weapons down at their sides so they wouldn’t accidently injure themselves or one another, and when they reached Walter’s door, they stopped. Enough light spilled into the hall from the kitchen for them to see that Trish’s bedroom door was open. The interior was dark, which only made sense. Why would she need light anymore?</p><p>Dean shifted his knife to his left hand, with the screwdriver. He then reached out and tried the knob of Walter’s door. He wasn’t surprised to find it locked. He returned his knife to his right hand, then turned to Sam and whispered, “Get ready.”</p><p>He’d seen cops break into locked rooms on TV and in the movies, but he’d never tried to do it himself before. <em>There’s a first time for everything,</em> their dad always said. Dean stepped back, raised his right leg, and slammed his foot against the door next to the knob. He had to repeat this maneuver twice more before the door finally burst open and swung inward.</p><p>Dean entered first, Sam right behind.</p><p>Walter’s nightstand light was on, and in its dim glow, Dean could see the man sitting up in bed, Trish crouched on the mattress next to him, her face buried in his neck.</p><p>He smiled weakly, his face pale. “It’s okay. She just wanted a snack. A little something to tide her over until morning.” He reached up a trembling hand and stroked Trish’s hair. “Wouldn’t want my girl to go to bed with an empty belly now, would I?”</p><p>In the future, when Dean would remember this moment, several horrible details would stand out. One was that despite what his daughter was doing to him, Walter didn’t cry out in pain. How detached from reality did you have to be not to feel someone tearing into your flesh with their teeth? Then there was the blood. Despite Trish’s best efforts to swallow as much as she could, blood stained the front of Walter’s T-shirt and soaked the sheet drawn up to his waist. Another was the wet smacking sounds that Trish made as she nuzzled at her father’s neck, sounds more like those of a baby animal suckling from its mother than an undead thing chewing on living meat. She’d been silent all day, but now sounds of satisfaction rumbled softly in Trish’s throat, almost like a cat’s purring. As bad as all these details were, though—and that was damned bad, make no mistake—the absolute worst for Dean was the look in Walter’s eyes. In them, Dean could see that, at least on some level, the man knew exactly what his daughter had become and what she was doing to him. Yet still he loved her, deeply, fiercely, and he would give her whatever she needed, even at the cost of his own life.</p><p>It was at that moment that Dean realized that as awful as hate was, love, unthinking and unrestrained, could be far more terrible.</p><p>Trish drew away from her father, ropey strands of blood stretching from her mouth to the ragged mess that had been his neck, and turned to regard Sam and Dean.</p><p>Dean thought there’d be hunger in her gaze, or rage, or maybe even sorrow, because deep down somewhere inside that cold, dead body she was still Trish, and she was horrified by what she had become, by what she was driven to do, but what he saw in her eyes was far worse. Her gaze was empty of all thought and emotion, bereft of the slightest sense of identity. Her eyes lacked even the basic self-awareness that an animal possesses. They were as empty as the largest subterranean caverns, as cold as the deepest arctic waters. Dean knew he was looking at something far worse than simple evil in her gaze. He was looking at nothing.</p><p>“Dean...”</p><p>“It’s all right, Sammy.” He knew damn well that it wasn’t, that after this nothing would ever be all right again, but he said it because he was the big brother, and it was the kind of thing you were supposed to say when things were bad. And he couldn’t imagine things getting much worse than this.</p><p>Trish began crawling toward them across the bed, her father’s blood dribbling from her mouth, pattering on the comforter like thick drops of crimson rain.</p><p>Dean wished to God he had a gun, but he didn’t, he had a knife and a Phillips screwdriver. And he had what his dad had always told him was the most important weapon of all. Himself. He switched the screwdriver to his right hand and took the knife in his left. Then, before he could reconsider, he ran toward Trish, took aim, and rammed the point of the screwdriver into her left eye, shoving the metal deep into her brain, all the way up to the handle.</p><p>He heard Sam gasp and saw Walter’s eyes widen with shock.</p><p>Trish didn’t react at all. Instead of blood, clear liquid trickled around the screwdriver protruding from her socket. She remained like that for several moments, crouching on all fours atop her father’s bed, expressionless, wounded eye leaking liquid, her mouth still dripping with Walter’s blood. Then suddenly, as if she was a machine whose power supply had been cut off, she slumped over, rolled off the bed, and thumped to the floor.</p><p>Dean could only stand and stare at Trish’s unmoving body, right hand slick with the clear goo that had spurted from her eye when he’d jammed the screwdriver in. A moment later, he felt Sam move to his side and put his arm around Dean’s shoulders. That simple gesture did more for Dean than any words his brother might have spoken.</p><p>Walter showed no reaction at first, and Dean feared that he’d lost so much blood that he wasn’t fully aware of what had happened. Then he let out a howl of anguish, jumped out of bed, and knelt next to his daughter’s body. He tried to pick her up and cradle her, but he was too weak and only managed to lift her partway before she slipped from his hands and fell back to the floor. A second later, tears streaming down his too-pale face, Walter collapsed beside her.</p><p>* * *</p><p>The brothers tried to revive Walter, but he’d lost too much blood. So they dug two graves in the back yard, beneath a large old oak that Trish had loved, and buried father and daughter, saying what words they could think of over their graves. They did their best to clean up the mess in Walter’s room, then searched the cabin and found the statuette of Anubis down in the basement in one of the drawers of Walter’s desk. After a brief discussion, they left it alone, along with a number of other artifacts Walter had stored in his workshop. When they were finished, they went upstairs, locked the basement door, and waited for their father to come get them.</p><p>It would be the better part of two weeks until John Winchester returned.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You guys were out at the motel during the fire, right?”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean, unsure how to answer the sheriff’s question.</p><p>She smiled. “Nothing personal, but you smell like you’ve been to a week-long bonfire.”</p><p>Dean grimaced. “I’m really getting tired of stinking up the joint wherever we go.”</p><p>The sheriff raised an eyebrow in curiosity. Amanda Kopp—who no doubt had long ago grown tired of hearing jokes about her surname—was in her mid-forties, with short brown hair, minimal makeup, and a thin white-gold wedding band on her ring finger. She was friendly, but projected an air of complete professionalism, the latter undercut somewhat by the Hello Kitty cover on the smartphone sitting on her desk in easy reach of her hand.</p><p>Sam wondered if she was one of those people who was so addicted to her phone that she felt anxious if she was too far away from it.</p><p>“It’s been a long few days,” Sam said, hoping she’d let it go at that.</p><p>“Tell me about it.” She let out a sigh. “I’ve got four people dead from some kind of mysterious wasting disease, in addition to the two from last week, and now to top it off, a whole motel burns down so fast it was like it was hit with goddamned napalm. That’s why I’m sitting on my ass in my office. I’m waiting on a call back from the CDC.”</p><p>Sam and Dean exchanged glances. It was just as they’d figured.</p><p>“We understand how busy you are, Sheriff,” Sam said, “and we really appreciate your taking the time to speak with us again.”</p><p>Although it had only been a couple days since they’d first spoken with Sheriff Kopp, she looked as if she’d aged ten years in that time. The lines on her face were more pronounced, and her eyes were red and sore-looking, much like Sam figured his own did. Unfortunately, Sam was far too used to seeing law officers suffering from stress and lack of sleep, not to mention the frustration of knowing something bad was happening in their town and having no idea what was causing it or how to stop it. Most of the time, he and Dean couldn’t tell the local authorities the truth, no matter how much they might want to. Almost always, in their experience, telling the authorities resulted in one of several increasingly negative scenarios. Best case, they’d think they were crazy and stop cooperating with them. Or they’d decide they needed to be held in custody for a psychiatric evaluation. In the worst case, the authorities would believe Sam and Dean, because then they would want to help, and that would put them face to face with dangers that they were in no way trained to deal with. It had worked out okay a time or two—like with Jody Mills in Sioux Falls—but those were the exceptions to the rule.</p><p>There was a reason why hunters tended to work alone or in pairs. The fewer people that had to risk their lives, and often more than just their lives, against the dark things that lived in the world’s shadows, the better. He thought of Trish Hansen. If he and Dean hadn’t let her talk them into taking her ghost hunting...</p><p>Dean frowned. “Wait a minute. Did you say there <em>were four</em> disease victims this week? I thought there were only three.”</p><p>“There were. Until Harrison Brauer turned up dead. He’s a local mortician, and he was due to meet with the wife of one of his... clients. Is that the right word? Anyway, when she got there the door was open, but she couldn’t find anyone, so she started calling Brauer’s name and wandering around his place, looking for him. Eventually, she wandered downstairs into his embalming room, and that’s where she found him, looking like all the others.”</p><p>Sam gave Dean a nod to say, <em>Nice catch.</em> As fuzzy-headed as he was, the detail had slipped right by him. Sam hadn’t considered that Dippel might have been using a mortician as his Igor, especially as it was unlikely the man would have the necessary medical background, but he supposed it was possible. If so, the mortician’s death could mean that Dippel was closing up shop in Brennan and preparing to move on. For all they knew, he might already have left town, in which case they’d have a hell of a time locating him. Sam doubted Dean would have the patience to even try. With Dippel gone, Dean would want to return to figuring out a way to take down Dick Roman.</p><p>Dean’s thoughts must have been running along similar lines, for he gave Sam a look that said, <em>Why are we wasting our time here?</em></p><p>“Sorry I didn’t call you guys,” the sheriff said. “Between trying to get hold of the CDC and dealing with the fire, I’ve had my hands full.”</p><p>“No problem,” Dean said. Sam thought he was going to tell the sheriff thanks, but they no longer needed her help. Instead he took a deep breath, and said, “But if you could answer just a few more questions for us...”</p><p>“Sure thing. It’s not like I’m doing anything at the moment besides sitting here waiting for my phone to ring.”</p><p>Sam wondered which she’d used. Her office phone or her smartphone. Maybe the latter, if for no other reason than to make sure no one else in the department could pick up their extension and listen in. If she believed she was dealing with some sort of contagion, the last thing she would want to do was cause a panic, especially among her own people.</p><p>“We’re exploring the possibility that someone with a medical background might be involved in these deaths,” Dean said.</p><p>Sheriff Kopp’s eyes widened. “You mean, someone did this on purpose? Like, some kind of <em>terrorist?</em> You think I should contact Homeland Security?”</p><p>“We’re just trying to cover all the bases,” Dean said. “At this juncture, we don’t have any evidence that would indicate terrorism. If we did, we’d be sure to tell you.”</p><p>The sheriff looked skeptical at the idea that federal agents would place a high priority on keeping a local like her in the loop, but she just said, “So what do you want to know?”</p><p>“Have there been any problems involving doctors or nurses in the area?” Sam asked. “Maybe even a nurse practitioner, a physician’s assistant, or a paramedic?”</p><p>“Problems?”</p><p>“Patient complaints,” Dean said. “Legal trouble. Strange behavior. Anything out of the ordinary.”</p><p>“You mean like a scandal?” she asked.</p><p>“It doesn’t have to be anything that major,” Sam said. “It could be something small, something that no one would think too much about in ordinary circumstances.”</p><p>She considered for a moment. “I’m sorry, but nothing’s coming to mind. Up until the last couple weeks, Brennan’s been a pretty quiet town. Usually, all we ever have to deal with is petty crime, marital disputes, and traffic violations.” She paused, and from the expression on her face, Sam knew she’d thought of something. “This might not be anything, but a few months back we had a father and daughter killed by a drunk driver. The girl was only fifteen, and just starting to learn how to drive. It was a damned shame. Anyway, the mother wasn’t with them when it happened, but she’s a doctor here in town. After the accident, she became depressed. Who wouldn’t, right? She started seeing fewer and fewer patients, until she finally stopped altogether. As far as I know, she hasn’t officially closed down her practice, but she might as well have.”</p><p>A grieving widow and mother who was also a doctor? Dippel would find her an irresistible candidate for an Igor. Not only did she have the knowledge of twenty-first century medicine he needed, but she had a compelling reason to want to work with him. Two reasons, in fact. Her husband and daughter. Sam thought of Walter Hansen, and he knew that if a grief-stricken parent had the opportunity to restore a dead child to life, he or she would be unable to resist taking it, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>Dean must have been thinking the same thing, for he gave Sam a quick nod before turning his attention back to Sheriff Kopp.</p><p>“We need the doctor’s name and address.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-13">CHAPTER 13</span><a href="#chapter-13" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Catherine gave Marshall’s body a final check. The tongue looked good—the NuFlesh had done its work, bonding the organ into place almost as easily as gluing two pieces of paper together—as did the new teeth. A couple of them weren’t as straight as she’d like, but she told herself not to be overly critical. Besides, human beings weren’t meant to be perfectly symmetrical. It was the imperfections, slight as they might be, that gave a man or woman character.</p><p>While she continued her examination, checking the spots where Marshall’s limbs—both original and new—had been fused, Conrad busied himself setting up the resurrection equipment. The procedure was primarily a chemical one, and the cart that Conrad wheeled over to the table where Marshall lay contained what at first glance appeared to be a simple arrangement of IV bottles, plastic tubing, and needles hanging from a metal framework. Chemicals of various colors filled the bottles, with tiny glints of illumination that resembled glowing flecks of multicolored metal floating within. Catherine had once asked Conrad what those flecks were, but he’d only given her a thin-lipped smile and said, “It’s an ancient secret.” At first she’d thought he was making a joke, but after everything she’d seen since starting to work with him, she’d come to accept that he was telling her the truth. An ancient secret, and no doubt one as dark as pitch, but she didn’t care, not as long as it returned her husband to her. There were enough chemicals in the bottles to treat both Marshall and Bekah today—assuming all went well with Marshall’s resurrection, that was.</p><p>Catherine knew the formulae for Conrad’s chemical mixtures, save for that one ingredient. Perhaps if she had a stronger background in chemistry, she might recognize the flecks, but she doubted it. Whatever they were, she didn’t think they were the sort of thing you could simply order from a chemical supply company.</p><p>Conrad wheeled a second cart over to Marshall that contained an external automated defibrillator—<em>Much more convenient than waiting for lightning to strike,</em> he’d once told her—along with strips of cloth that had been chemically treated and coated with more of those mysterious flecks of metal. She knew from their previous experiments that Conrad would wrap the strips around Marshall’s chest, leaving a section bare so the defibrillator’s electrodes could make contact with his skin. His head would be wrapped in the cloth, too, down to the neck. The one new element in the procedure this time was Conrad’s stone, the so-called Lapis Occultus. She had no idea what it was and would have dismissed it as pure nonsense if she hadn’t held it in her hand and felt its power for herself. The stone, he had explained to her, would be placed on Marshall’s forehead before the procedure got underway. When she’d asked Conrad what the stone’s purpose was, he’d been even more vague than usual: <em>It’s to ensure that death is held at bay indefinitely.</em></p><p>She’d long ago given up doubting Conrad’s claims. She’d seen too much, accomplished too much with him. If he said the stone would provide some kind of protection against death, then she believed him.</p><p>Satisfied that Marshall’s body was ready for the procedure, Catherine double-checked the IV bottles, tubing, and needles. Conrad had no ego when it came to his work. He insisted that Catherine check everything he did to make sure all was in order. The only thing that mattered to him was obtaining his desired outcome. He didn’t care who made a mistake, he only cared about finding and fixing it. In another person, she would have found the quality admirable, but in Conrad, she knew it arose from a single-minded obsession with success at all costs, including the sublimation of his own ego. Why he was so hell-bent on success, she wasn’t certain, but she sensed his motivation was more than merely intellectual, and it sure as hell wasn’t altruistic. He was working toward something, and had been for a long time, and helping her restore her husband and daughter to life was only one more step toward achieving his ultimate goal. She’d never asked him what that goal was, and truthfully, she didn’t care, not as long as she got Marshall and Bekah back.</p><p>Once she’d determined the chemicals and IVs were in order, she double-checked the defibrillator while Conrad examined Marshall to make sure she hadn’t missed anything. The defibrillator’s battery was fully charged, and it seemed to be in perfect working condition. When their examinations were complete, Conrad looked at her.</p><p>“Shall we finish?” he asked.</p><p>She nodded and together they wrapped the treated cloth strips around Marshall’s head and chest, Conrad lifting his body as needed while Catherine wrapped. The cloth needed to be put on immediately before the procedure, because—for reasons she didn’t understand—the chemicals it had been treated with lost their efficacy the longer they were in contact with the skin. They’d only used half the strips by the time they were finished. The other half were for Bekah. They checked to make sure Marshall was wrapped tight, and then Conrad took the Lapis Occultus from the cart and gently, almost reverently, placed it on Marshall’s forehead.</p><p>He stepped back and cocked his head as he regarded the stone’s placement. Catherine couldn’t see what earthly difference the position of the object made, but Conrad must have, for he reached out, made a small adjustment, then nodded to himself.</p><p>“I believe we are ready to begin inserting the—“</p><p><em>Needles,</em> Catherine knew he’d been about to say, but he broke off, a look of astonishment on his face. He raised his hand with the X on it and stared at the mark as if he couldn’t believe what he was seeing. The X looked the same to her, but whatever had changed about it had alarmed the usually unflappable Mr. Dippel.</p><p>“We need to hurry,” he said, tension in his voice. “They’re coming.”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Two men. Hunters... Killers. They want to stop us. I thought I’d dealt with them...” He curled his hand into a fist. “...but evidently I was mistaken.”</p><p>Catherine’s head was swimming. “What are they? Police? Hit men? Secret agents, for god’s sake?”</p><p>“I don’t have time to explain fully. Suffice it to say that they will break into your home, come down here, and not only stop what we’re doing, but destroy Marshall and Bekah’s bodies to ensure they will never rise. Is that what you want?”</p><p>Conrad was shouting by the time he reached the end of his words, but it was his emotional intensity more than anything else that convinced Catherine he was speaking the truth.</p><p>“What do we do?”</p><p>“I can try to hold them off, but at this point, I’m not confident in my ability to do so alone. If I had use of the Lapis Occultus... But no, it’s needed here. No matter what else occurs, it is vital that Bekah be restored to life.”</p><p>Just Bekah, she noted. Not Marshall.</p><p>Conrad looked down at Marshall’s body, still lifeless and waiting for resurrection. A cold sly smile spread across his face.</p><p>“If I had your husband’s help...”</p><p>“No! I’m not going to bring Marshall back only to send him into harm’s way. If these men really are as dangerous as you seem to think—“</p><p>“I’ll ask you the same question I asked regarding which of your loved ones was to be resurrected first. Given the situation, what would Marshall do?”</p><p>As before, Catherine didn’t have to think about her reply. “Protect his daughter.”</p><p>Without exchanging another word, they began inserting the IV needles into various points of Marshall’s body.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Daniel raged inside the confines of the Lapis Occultus. To his perceptions, it seemed as if he was floating disembodied within an endless expanse of darkness, and that he’d been there for a very, very long time. Another being might well have gone insane in the same circumstances, but Daniel was a Reaper. Darkness, no matter how vast or unending, didn’t scare him. It did, however, seriously piss him off.</p><p>He couldn’t believe he’d allowed himself to be captured by Dippel. It hadn’t occurred to him that the alchemist might have conceived of a way to harness the energy of a Reaper and use it in his obscene experiments. That was something Daniel needed to prevent at any cost. The question was, how? He’d tried translocating, a common ability for his kind. Normally, he could move from one location to another simply by willing it, but no matter how hard he concentrated, no matter how much power he summoned, he was unable to break free of the darkness. He’d tried reaching out to any other Reapers that might be in the vicinity. Considering how many deaths had taken place in Brennan lately, there were bound to be a few around. Yet although he strained to stretch his thoughts outward, he was unable to penetrate his prison’s walls. That left him with only one option—the last option, as far as any Reaper was concerned—calling the boss.</p><p>Death was a strong believer in delegating. When he assigned a task to one of his servants, he expected it to be carried out, and if any problems arose, he expected them to be dealt with. What he did <em>not</em> want was to be bothered every time some little thing went wrong. Whenever Death was disturbed for something trivial—and given what he was, almost everything was trivial to him—he was not slow to express his displeasure. But Daniel didn’t see any other choice left to him. If Dippel succeeded in incarnating Hel, as bad as it would be for the humans on Earth, it would be far worse for him. Death would make certain of it.</p><p>Daniel had no eyes to close in his black prison, but he imagined himself performing the action anyway. He concentrated and called out to Death—</p><p>—and received no answer.</p><p>Daniel was shocked. There was no place in existence that Death couldn’t reach. All worlds, all times, all dimensions were part of his inconceivably vast domain. Yet Death hadn’t heard him.</p><p>Whatever this stone was, it had been created by magic far greater than Daniel had anticipated. Perhaps Hel herself had taken a hand in its construction. She was nowhere near as powerful as Death, but as a goddess of death (with a lowercase d) her power could easily counter Daniel’s.</p><p>He was on his own, trapped in a magic artifact, his energy to be used to pave the way for an ancient Norse goddess of death to enter the world of the living. There was nothing he could do but wait and hope the Winchesters found a way to succeed where he had failed. Which didn’t do anything to improve his mood.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean drove past Catherine Luss’s house, then pulled the car off the side of the road onto the shoulder. Catherine lived out in the country. There were no sidewalks, and he didn’t want to park in her driveway. The last thing the brothers wanted to do was announce their presence. Dean turned off the engine.</p><p>Then he looked at Sam. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I-don’t-know-what-you-mean,” Sam answered quickly, speaking so fast his words ran together.</p><p>“Yeah, you do. Ever since we stopped at that gas station so you could hit the head and get rid of all that coffee you’ve been drinking, you’ve been suspiciously wide awake and full of energy.”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>Dean noted his brother’s bouncing leg and tapping fingers.</p><p>“Maybe-the-caffeine-finally-kicked-in,” Sam offered in his too-rapid voice.</p><p><em>“Something</em> kicked in,” Dean said, “but it sure as hell isn’t caffeine. What did you do? Steal some pick-me-up pills from the med kit?”</p><p>Hunters tended to get banged up pretty good on the job, and even if there was a hospital in the area, they preferred to patch their own wounds whenever possible. Fewer questions that way. So every hunter had a fully stocked medical kit with its own mini-pharmacy. Dean figured that while he’d been busy buying some snacks—extra-hot jalapeno tortilla chips and crème-filled chocolate snack cakes—Sam had grabbed some stimulants from the kit and taken them in the restroom.</p><p>At first Sam looked as if he intended to deny it, but then he sighed.</p><p>“You know the weird black veiny marks on my leg? They’ve spread.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like where this was going. “How far?”</p><p>“Basically, my whole leg is covered now. I can still walk, but it’s numb all over. If there’s any chance of fixing whatever’s wrong with me, it lies with Dippel. I can’t afford to sit this one out, Dean. Not if I want to survive.”</p><p>“I could—“</p><p>“And I’m <em>not</em> letting you face the real-world equivalent of Dr. Frankenstein on your own.”</p><p>Dean didn’t like it. In fact, it pissed him off something fierce. It didn’t help that he knew he would have done the same thing if their situations had been reversed.</p><p>“How large a dose did you take?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Large enough. Let’s go before it starts wearing off.”</p><p>Sam got out of the car before Dean could say anything else. He sat there for a moment, struggling to deal with his anger.</p><p>“Sam, if you die because of this, I’m going to force Dippel to teach me how to resurrect the dead, and then I’m going to bring you back so I can kill you myself!”</p><p>He let out a long sigh of frustration and got out of the car. Sam already had the car’s trunk open and was gearing up. Dean joined him, nose wrinkling at the stink of their plastic-bagged clothes. Was there any substance on the planet that could contain the Frankenstench?</p><p>They selected the same weapons they’d carried during the hunt for the Double-Header. Dean armed himself with his Colt and the Winchester shotgun, and Sam chose his Beretta and the sawed-off double barrel. They each took a pair of KA-BAR knives and some flares. They hadn’t had a chance to use the latter against the Double-Header, but they could still come in handy. This time, they brought something new, one of their standard pieces of equipment that they rarely got to use: a homemade flamethrower constructed from a container of kerosene, various lengths of pipe, and a control button to regulate the release of fuel. It was capable of producing a flame about fifteen feet long, but the kerosene wouldn’t last forever, so you had to make sure every blast counted.</p><p>Sam started to speak, but Dean cut him off.</p><p>“Given your condition, there’s no way I’m letting you use this thing, so don’t even ask.”</p><p>Sam scowled, but he didn’t protest.</p><p>Dean slipped the flamethrower’s straps over his shoulders, then stood for a moment to get a feel for the weight. Carrying the flamethrower always made him feel as if he had a bomb on his back that was ready to go off at any time. <em>Fun, fun, fun!</em></p><p>“Once more into the breach, eh?” Dean said.</p><p>“Unto,” Sam said. “The correct quote is ‘Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more.’ It’s from Shakespeare’s <em>Henry V.”</em></p><p>Dean sighed. He should’ve known better that to try and get literary on Sam.</p><p>“How about this? Let’s go kick some Frankenass.”</p><p>“That’ll work,” Sam said with a smile, and together they headed for the house.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Catherine had attached the electrodes of the automated external defibrillator to Marshall’s chest. Normally the sensors in the electrodes sent data to the AED’s computer, which would determine whether someone was experiencing sudden cardiac arrest and required an electric shock. The computer would then use voice prompts to guide whoever was using the device, but Catherine had deactivated that function, as it was for people without medical training. Besides, at the moment Marshall had no heartbeat, and therefore there was no data for the computer to pick up. In a normal situation, this would mean the device wouldn’t deliver a charge, but she’d paid a local computer repairman a sizeable sum to bypass those safety features for her, and to keep his mouth shut about it. This AED was one of the early models and was capable of delivering a shock of up to four hundred joules. More recent models gave two sequential shocks of only one-twenty to two hundred joules, as that was now considered safer for the patient, but Catherine didn’t need safe. She needed a strong enough charge to, as Conrad had put it, “galvanize the chemical admixture.” Four hundred joules had been sufficient to do that for the dog. She prayed it would be enough for Marshall.</p><p>“I believe the moment is at hand,” Conrad said. He stood by the cart containing the IV bottles, monitoring the amount of chemicals that had passed into Marshall’s body.</p><p>Catherine nodded. She had gone through this procedure a number of times, first with rats and then with the dog. The rats hadn’t lasted long, decaying in less than a day. The dog had been more successful, but it too had succumbed to tissue degradation in the end. She hoped that Conrad’s magic stone would make the difference, but there was only one way to find out.</p><p>Each time she’d gone through this, she was amazed at how unremarkable it all was. No Van de Graaff generators crackling with electricity, no crazed hunchbacked assistant’s mad cackling, no spooky gothic music swelling in the background, just a few chemicals quietly entering the bloodstream and then a single button to push. Bringing the dead back to life should be a spectacular, monumental moment. Instead, it was no more dramatic than any other medical procedure. Of course, the results were a different story.</p><p>She stepped over to the defibrillator, said, “Clear,” more as a precaution than from any real worry that Conrad might be in physical contact with Marshall’s body, and pushed the button.</p><p>Marshall’s muscles tightened and his spine arced as electricity coursed through his body. She’d inserted a plastic mouth guard between his teeth to make sure he didn’t bite his new tongue. After all the work she’d put in to attaching the organ, she didn’t want anything to happen to it. The Lapis Occultus was dislodged from his forehead, but before it could tumble to the floor, Conrad’s hand shot out and snatched it from the air, moving with inhuman speed. As far as she could see, the stone hadn’t done anything special, but Conrad held it close to his eyes, examined it, then nodded as if satisfied.</p><p>Once the charge had been delivered, Marshall’s body collapsed back onto the table and lay still once more. Catherine knew that what she had witnessed was a reflex action, not any sign of life, but she still couldn’t help being encouraged. Just to see him move again after all these months, even if it was just a reflex, filled her heart with joy.</p><p>“Check the defibrillator’s battery,” Conrad said. “We need to make sure there’s enough charge remaining for Bekah.”</p><p>Catherine didn’t want to take her eyes off Marshall, but she did as Conrad said. If he was right about the two men who were coming, they didn’t have any time to waste. She checked the readout and saw there was enough power remaining for at least one more charge, maybe two.</p><p>“It’s fine,” she said.</p><p>She turned back just in time to hear Marshall draw in a gasping breath of air, his first in months.</p><p>“Remove the bandages!” Conrad said.</p><p>They each grabbed a pair of surgical scissors and began cutting the cloth strips away from Marshall, Conrad cutting those around his chest, Catherine those around his head. When the bandages fell away from his face, she saw that his eyes were open and looking up at her. She had been afraid she would see the same glassy expression that the dog’s eyes had held—dead eyes with no hint of life or recognition in them—but his eyes were alive and intelligence shone in them. He mumbled something, trying to speak around the mouth guard. She gently removed it, and Marshall said, “Caff... rinn?”</p><p>His voice was a deep phlegmy rumble, unlike his normal tenor, and his mouth couldn’t form the syllables quite right, the sounds too soft and mushy, but it was Marshall speaking. The first word he’d said had been her name.</p><p>She felt tears trickling down her face and realized she was crying. “Yes, sweetheart. It’s me.” She took his hand and gave it a squeeze. At first his hand remained limp, and she feared something was wrong, but then he squeezed back, his grip strong—even stronger than she remembered.</p><p>“I’m genuinely sorry I have to do this. I’d prefer to give the two of you more time to enjoy your reunion, but as the British say, ‘Needs must when the devil drives.’”</p><p>She looked at Conrad in time to see him hold a small envelope over Marshall’s mouth. Yellowish powder drifted out and floated down to cover his face in a light coating. Without thinking, she lashed out and smacked the envelope out of Conrad’s hand, but it was too late. Whatever he’d intended to do was done.</p><p>Though Conrad’s eyes flashed with anger at having been struck by her, his voice was icily calm as he spoke. “His mind will most likely be confused during the post-regeneration period, and even if he was at his peak mentally, it would take too long to explain the current situation to him. The powder I used will make him obey me without question. I assure you the effect is only temporary.”</p><p>Catherine didn’t like it, not one bit. She especially didn’t like Conrad’s use of the word obey, as if he were the master and Marshall nothing more than his slave. She forced herself to think practically instead of emotionally, though. It had taken the dog almost a full day to recover from the effects of being reborn. During that time, it had slept, mostly. Perhaps Marshall would recover more swiftly, especially since they’d used the Lapis Occultus with him, but they couldn’t afford to wait and find out.</p><p>“Very well,” she said. “But I expect you to make sure he’s as safe as possible.”</p><p>Conrad smiled. “Of course. Take heart. If he <em>is</em> damaged, we’ll just repair him.”</p><p>He looked at Marshall, and his smile fell away. He removed the defibrillator’s electrodes from his chest and handed them to Catherine.</p><p>“Get off the table.”</p><p>Marshall did as Conrad commanded, not bothering to wipe the residue of yellow powder from his face. His movements were stiff and uncoordinated, but Catherine knew from previous experiments that he’d soon adjust to his new body. She hoped it would be soon enough to help him fight off the two killers Conrad assured her were coming. She did wish there was time to put some clothes on him, though. She didn’t like the idea of sending him out to fight naked, but there was nothing to be done about it now.</p><p><em>Maybe it won’t matter to him,</em> she thought. <em>Maybe he is like a newborn child, innocent and without shame.</em></p><p>“Stand over there.” Conrad pointed to the basement steps. After a second’s hesitation, Marshall lurched over to the steps and stood there, a blank expression on his face.</p><p>Catherine couldn’t stand seeing him look like that. She hadn’t brought her husband back to life to become a mindless automaton.</p><p>Before she could protest, Conrad said, “Quickly. We must make Bekah ready. I fear you’ll have to perform the procedure by yourself, my dear, but I believe you’re more than capable.”</p><p>Catherine wasn’t certain about that, but if it was a choice between bringing Bekah back by herself or watching as her daughter’s body was destroyed by these so-called hunters, then it was really no choice at all.</p><p>“Let’s get her on the table,” she said.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam wasn’t sure taking the stimulants had been a good idea. His heart was racing, and his skin was slick with sweat. Worse, his pulse felt erratic, black spots danced in his vision, and he couldn’t feel his right leg at all. It wasn’t even numb; it just felt like it wasn’t there. He had to concentrate extra hard with every step he took to make sure he didn’t fall over. The hell of it was, he <em>still</em> felt tired. Not sleepy-tired, but physically exhausted, as if his body was on the verge of collapse. To make matters even worse, he’d started hallucinating. Nothing major yet, just ghostly half-images of strange shapes he couldn’t identify, but he knew from experience that the hallucinations would soon intensify, and when that happened, he wouldn’t be able to tell what was real from what wasn’t. Which would be liable to get both him and his brother killed.</p><p><em>Come on, Sam,</em> he told himself. <em>Just try to hold it together a little longer...</em></p><p>One benefit of the Luss residence being located outside town was that there were no nearby neighbors to call the police and report a pair of armed men sneaking around to the back of the house. One disadvantage was the amount of trees in the Luss’s yard, or rather, all the leaves that had fallen from them. It seemed Dr. Luss had been too busy playing mad scientist to do any yard work, and her property was covered with brown, yellow, red and—above all—<em>crunchy</em> leaves. Sam and Dean had to move carefully to make sure they didn’t make too much noise, but a certain amount was unavoidable. They’d have to hope that whoever was inside was either too busy to pay attention to any sounds outside, or if they did hear some leaves crunch, would put it down to squirrels or deer. It was dusk, and the fading light would help to conceal them somewhat, but not as much as if it was full night. They’d debated waiting until dark to approach the house, but given the fact that Dippel might be preparing to leave town as soon as possible, they’d decided they couldn’t afford to. They would have to rely on a hunter’s two best friends: surprise and one hell of a lot of luck.</p><p>Sam began shivering, but although the air was chilly, he knew the cold came from inside. If he could examine himself unclothed in front of a full-length mirror right now, how far would he see the infection had spread? Onto his stomach? Maybe up to his chest? How much longer did he have until the dark taint inside him had spread to the point where his body could no longer function? He had no idea, but if he was going to be taking an eternal dirt nap after this hunt, he at least wanted to see it through to the end. He owed Dean far more than that, more than he could ever repay, but it would have to be good enough, for it might be all he had left.</p><p>The Luss family had a deck at the rear of their house, with a picnic table on one end and a gas grill set next to a patio door. Sam wondered when the last time was that all three of them—Catherine, her husband, and her daughter—had sat out there and had a meal, talking, laughing, enjoying being in one another’s presence. What had it been like for Catherine to come home to an empty house after a long day of seeing patients? Had she looked through the patio window at the picnic table, maybe even stepped outside and sat down at it for a few minutes, crying and remembering? No wonder Conrad Dippel had chosen her to be his ultimate Igor. With the sorrow she carried, she would have been ripe for his psychological manipulation.</p><p>The brothers walked side by side, close enough that when Dean whispered, Sam had no trouble hearing him. “I’ll go in through the patio door. You stay outside in case anyone tries to get away.”</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Sam whispered back. “I’m perfectly capable of going in with you, and since we don’t know if there are any more Frankenmutts or Double-Header juniors in there, you’re going to need back-up.”</p><p>Dean didn’t look happy about it. “Fine. But you’re not in the best shape right now, and you know it. So if—“</p><p>Dean was cut off by the sound of shattering glass as a naked man crashed through the patio door. Glass shards scattered across the deck, and blood from fresh cuts on the man’s hands and forearms pattered to the wood in thick droplets.</p><p>Dean looked at Sam. “He might be naked, but at least he doesn’t have any extra body parts.”</p><p>“True.”</p><p>Dippel, dressed formally in a gray suit and tie, stepped through the opening in the patio door and onto the deck.</p><p>“My apologies,” he said, his voice carrying a hint of a German accent. “It appears Mr. Luss hasn’t yet remembered the proper way to open a patio door.”</p><p>“The naked guy is the doctor’s husband,” Sam said.</p><p>“And it looks like we managed to get here before Dippel skipped town,” Dean replied.</p><p>Luss stood on the deck, looking at them without expression. He seemed more like a classic voodoo zombie—the kind that was resurrected to serve as a mindless servant of a houngan—than a Frankensteinian creation. Then again, as Sam looked closer, he could see the scar lines where NuFlesh had been used to attach various body parts together, and although they were close matches, they weren’t exact. The right leg was slightly longer than the other and had more body hair, while the left arm was thinner than the right, its skin a shade or two darker. As Sam watched, dark energy gathered around Luss’s arms, just as he had seen with the Double-Header.</p><p>“Do you see that?” he asked Dean.</p><p>“See what? The guy’s Frankendork hanging out? And by the way, if his wife put him back together, you’d think she’d have given him a little extra in that department, you know what I mean?” Dean looked toward the resurrected Mr. Luss. “Nothing personal!” he called out.</p><p>“He’s got the same ability to drain life force that the Double-Header had,” Sam said.</p><p>“Death vision?” Dean asked.</p><p>Sam nodded.</p><p>“All right. Important safety tip. Thanks.” Dean took a step forward and addressed Dippel. “You see we’re armed, right? So before any of us goes and does something stupid, let’s talk.”</p><p>Sam glanced sideways at his brother. <em>What are you up to?</em> he thought.</p><p>Dippel smiled. “What is it you Americans say? We don’t negotiate with terrorists.” He turned to Marshall Luss. “Kill them.”</p><p>The man started toward them, ignoring the glass shards on the deck. He cut his feet and left bloody footprints in his wake, but the injuries didn’t seem to cause him any more pain than the cuts on his hands and arms did.</p><p>Dean cradled his shotgun in his elbow, grabbed a flare from his jacket pocket, pulled off the striking cap, and lit it. A shower of reddish sparks burst forth from the flare’s tip. Dean dropped the striking cap and, still cradling his shotgun, held the burning flare out before him and started walking toward the deck.</p><p>Marshall stopped at the edge of the deck, blood pooling beneath his shredded feet and dripping from his hands. The dark energy that had been building around his hands faded and was gone. An expression crossed his face at last. It was one of fear.</p><p>“Fire bad,” Dean said.</p><p>“Indeed,” Dippel commented dryly. “I would think it doubly true in your case, considering you carry a container of flammable liquid on your back.”</p><p>“What can I say? I’m just a guy who likes living on the edge.”</p><p>Dippel regarded Dean for a moment, sizing him up, Sam thought, trying to determine how dangerous he was. Evidently, dangerous enough, for Dippel said, “What did you want to talk about?”</p><p>“My brother got bit by your dog, and he picked up some kind of Frankenrabies. You’re going to cure him.”</p><p>Dippel arced an eyebrow. “Is this so? And why, pray tell, would I do something so clearly against my own interests?”</p><p>“Because if you do, we’ll let you go.”</p><p>Sam couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “Are you nuts?”</p><p>Dean ignored him. “And there’s one other thing.”</p><p>Dippel laughed. “You’re a bold one, aren’t you? Very well, what is it?”</p><p>“We need a weapon.”</p><p>Sam didn’t like where this was heading. “Dean, we can’t do this. We’ve both made deals we shouldn’t have, with forces we shouldn’t have, and it’s never turned out well.”</p><p>Dean kept his gaze focused on Dippel. “You ever heard of the Leviathan?”</p><p>Dippel’s eyes narrowed. “I’ve encountered some lore about them in my time.”</p><p>“Well, they’re real and they’re loose on Earth. My brother and I are determined to stop them before they turn the planet into their personal all-you-can-eat buffet, but to do that, we’re going to need some serious firepower. Something like that fire lizard you sicced on us back at the motel.”</p><p>“So if I cure your brother and give you a weapon, you’ll simply allow me to depart Brennan—<em>and you</em> won’t attempt to hunt me down later?”</p><p>“Oh, we’ll come after you eventually,” Dean said. “Assuming the Leviathan don’t make a meal out of us. But that’s down the road. What we’re talking about now is what it’s going to take for you to live long enough to get out of town.”</p><p>“I must admit, it’s an intriguing offer.”</p><p>Dippel looked as if he might be considering it, but Marshall’s fear of the flare seemed to be fading. He stepped closer to the edge of the deck, and the black energy began to swirl around his arms once again. He no longer looked afraid. He looked angry.</p><p><em>This,</em> Sam thought, <em>is bullshit.</em></p><p>He shifted his sawed-off shotgun to his left hand, drew his Beretta, took aim at Marshall Luss, and fired.</p><h2><span id="chapter-14">CHAPTER 14</span><a href="#chapter-14" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Catherine stood next to the defibrillator, finger poised above the activation button. Bekah’s head and chest were wrapped tight in the treated cloth strips, and the rest of her body appeared whole and unmarred. The IV needles had been inserted at various junctures and had delivered the chemicals into her vascular system, and the AED’s sensors had been attached, one to her upper chest, one to her lower. Her flesh showed no sign of decay, and the NuFlesh scars were less noticeable on her than on Marshall. Catherine knew it was sexist of her, but she’d taken more care with Bekah than Marshall because she thought the scarring issue would matter more to a young woman than it would to a middle-aged man. She didn’t think Marshall would mind.</p><p>She jumped when she heard the distant sound of shattering glass.</p><p><em>It’s started.</em></p><p>She knew she should activate the defibrillator, but she hesitated. Had she administered the IV chemicals in the right dosages? Properly positioned the Lapis Occultus on Bekah’s forehead? She’d told Conrad that enough battery power remained to operate the AED, but what if she’d miscalculated? What if she had made a mistake somewhere along the line? The smallest error could negatively affect the outcome, and if the procedure didn’t work, if Bekah didn’t return to life, Catherine feared she might not get another chance. It wouldn’t matter if Marshall and Conrad defeated the hunters, not if Bekah’s body was so damaged due to her bungling that it couldn’t be salvaged. Bekah would die a second death before she could be reborn, and after that, resurrection would no longer be possible.</p><p>Catherine felt the temperature in the basement drop, as if the central air had been turned on and the thermostat set to “cold as ice.” Shadows gathered from every corner of the room, sliding across the floor toward her like sinuous black serpents. She watched with a mixture of awe and dread as the shadows merged to form a swirling whirlpool of darkness. A moment later a figure rose from the ebon mass, a woman with marble-white skin who wore the shadows around her like a cloak of night. Her eyes were solid obsidian, and her lips the bright red of arterial spray. She was the most beautiful being, male or female, that Catherine had ever seen.</p><p>The woman’s mouth didn’t move, but Catherine heard her speak nonetheless.</p><p><em>Fear not, my daughter. Your work has been exemplary. This body is both comely and strong, and with the aid of the Lapis Occultus, it shall contain the whole of my power without ill effect. It will be the perfect vessel. All you need do is release the tiny lightning, and your daughter will not only draw breath again, she shall truly be reborn, becoming something far more than you ever dreamed possible.</em></p><p>The voice was cold but hypnotic, a winter wind whispering across a snow-covered plain in the dead of night. Catherine felt compelled to obey, and if she noted the woman’s use of the word vessel, it did not trouble her. She smiled as she gazed into the limitless dark depths of the woman’s eyes, and she pressed the defibrillator’s button.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean saw blood mist from Marshall Luss’s right shoulder the same instant he heard the crack of Sam’s Beretta going off. He didn’t know what he was angrier about, that Sam had shot before he could negotiate a deal with Dippel, or that he’d missed doing any real damage to Marshall.</p><p><em>His aim’s off because he’s so sick,</em> Dean thought. <em>Hell, he’s probably lucky he still has the strength to hold the damned gun and squeeze the trigger.</em> Taking all that into consideration, he supposed it wasn’t that bad of a shot after all. Still, it pissed him off, and it didn’t leave him much choice about what to do next.</p><p>He hurled the flare toward Marshall, and before it could strike him, he switched the Winchester into a firing position and let ‘er rip.</p><p>Marshall brought up his hands to shield his face and took a step back as the burning flare tumbled toward him. His feet were still slick with blood, and that’s what saved his life—or unlife, as the case might be. His feet slid out from under him and he fell backward just as Dean fired his shotgun. Marshall slammed to the deck, glass shards lodging in his back. The flare hit the deck, bounced a couple times, then rolled to a stop six feet from him. The wood beneath the blazing tip blackened and began to burn. Marshall jumped to his feet and pointed at the flare.</p><p>“Fy-uh!” he shouted. “Fy-uh!”</p><p>He sounded like a four-year-old, maybe younger. Hearing a child’s halting attempt at language come out of a grown man’s mouth filled Dean with both pity and rage. As much as he hated monsters, he viewed most of them as not much different than animals. They did what they did because it was their nature, but because they preyed on humans who didn’t believe in them and had no idea how to defend themselves, hunters like him and Sam—and Bobby and their dad—had to kill them. Demons were a different story, of course, and don’t get him started on friggin’ angels! But the poor reanimated son of a bitch that was Marshall Luss hadn’t asked to become an undead <em>thing,</em> and he’d still be resting in peace if it wasn’t for Conrad “Just call me the mad alchemist” Dippel. He was the real monster.</p><p>“You know, Sam, it’s been a while since we had ourselves a good old-fashioned barbecue.”</p><p>He dropped the Winchester to the ground, took hold of the flamethrower’s nozzle, and started running toward the deck. Although the fire stream had a fifteen-foot range, he wanted to get good and close before unleashing hell so he could make every lick of flame count. He could hear kerosene slosh as he ran, and he couldn’t wait to empty the whole damned container on Dippel.</p><p>Dippel looked less than impressed by Dean’s charge. He reached into a pocket of his pants, pulled out a fistful of powder, and tossed it at the flare, barking a few harsh words in what Dean supposed was German as he did so. The powder transformed into water in midair and splashed down onto the flare, dousing both it and the flames around it.</p><p>Dippel turned to face Dean, reaching into his pocket for more powder.</p><p>Dean came to a halt three yards from Dippel, raised the flamethrower’s nozzle, and thumbed the switch.</p><p>“Flame on!” he shouted.</p><p>A stream of fire shot from the flamethrower’s nozzle and arced toward Dippel just as the alchemist hurled the rain powder and shouted more German. But Dean wasn’t aiming directly at Dippel. Instead, he aimed at the deck around Dippel’s feet, stepping to the side as he fired to avoid the powder—now water—coming at him. Flaming liquid splashed onto the deck, causing Marshall to shriek in terror and leap into the yard to get away from the “Fy-uh.” Dean would deal with him later. Right now his primary objective was to cook himself up a little Southern fried Dippel.</p><p>He’d forgotten the powder-turned-water was magical in origin, however, and instead of splashing harmlessly to the ground, it changed trajectory in midair and curved toward the flamethrower’s nozzle. Before Dean could react, it struck the nozzle and flowed into it, the water moving as if it was alive. The fire cut off at once, and although Dean thumbed the release button several times, all that came out were thin streams of decidedly not-flaming liquid. The flames he’d already ignited on the deck were spreading, but none had reached Dippel yet, and the alchemist was hard at work using more of his magic water-powder to douse the fire.</p><p><em>Some Human Torch you turned out to be,</em> Dean thought.</p><p>He caught movement from the corner of his eye and turned just in time to see Marshall Luss running toward him, features contorted into a mask of rage, bloody hands stretched out, fingers curled into fists.</p><p>“Fy-uh bad!” he bellowed. “You bad!”</p><p>“Sam? A little help?”</p><p>No reply. Dean’s gut twisted with a cold, sick feeling, he looked over his shoulder to see Sam lying on the ground, still clutching his Beretta, eyes closed, body still. Dean couldn’t tell if his brother was still breathing, but he couldn’t afford to waste any more time fighting. He needed Dippel’s help.</p><p>Marshall slammed into him with all the ferocity of a pro linebacker. The resurrected man wrapped his arms around Dean as he hit, and the impact carried them both to the ground. Dean tried to twist out of Marshall’s grip on the way down, but the man was strong as hell—probably way stronger than he’d been in life—and he was unable to break free. Dean’s breath was forced out of his lungs as he struck the ground, Marshall still holding tight to him. Under other circumstances, Dean might have found it more than a little awkward to have a naked man lying on top of him, but just then he had bigger concerns. The longer it took him to get Sam help, the greater the chance that his brother would die. His thoughts raced as he desperately tried to think of a way to break the man’s iron grip. Then he felt a familiar draining sensation, as if the life was being sucked out of him. He remembered Sam telling him that Marshall had the same ability to drain life force as Frankenmutt and the Double-Header. If he didn’t get away from Marshall fast, he’d be sucked drier than a juice box on a desert playground at high noon. Dean thrashed and kicked, but nothing he did helped, and he could already feel himself growing weaker. A few more moments, and it would be over. His worst nightmare would have come true. He’d have failed to carry out the charge his father had given him so many years ago: to take care of his younger brother. More than that, he would have failed to kill that slimy land-shark Dick Roman and avenge Bobby’s death.</p><p><em>Looks like I’ll be joining you in the Happy Hunting Ground, you old grump,</em> Dean thought. <em>Hope you got a cold one waiting for me.</em></p><p>He continued struggling, but it was getting harder to move. It would be so much easier to lie back, close his eyes, and allow himself to slip away. No more killing, no more feeling like he carried the whole damn world on his back, like everyone’s lives depended on him not screwing up. In a lot of ways, death would come as a relief. All he had to do was stop fighting...</p><p>“Hold!”</p><p><em>A woman’s voice. No, a teenage girl’s.</em></p><p>Dean immediately felt the draining sensation stop. Marshall released him and rose to his feet. Dean was too weak for the moment to do anything but lie where he was and watch.</p><p>Dippel knelt on the scorched deck, head bowed. A woman Dean presumed was Catherine Luss stood next to him, gazing with adoration upon a brown-haired, barefoot girl dressed in a T-shirt and jeans, both black. On the shirt in white letters: <em>I’m only wearing black until they make something darker.</em> In her right hand, the girl held a dark blue stone.</p><p>She looked at Dean. “My apologies. I would have been here sooner, but I insisted on finding something to wear first. Do you like it?” She twirled around to display her outfit. “To the Norse people, the color black symbolized new beginnings, just as night heralds the birth of day, and winter the birth of summer. I thought it appropriate considering that today is the day of <em>my</em> birth, in a sense.”</p><p><em>Norse?</em> Dean thought. Then he registered the way Dippel was kneeling before her, like she was some kind of...</p><p>He moaned as he struggled to a sitting position. “Don’t tell me we’re dealing with another friggin’ god! I am so sick of you guys! You’re nothing but stuck-up monsters with delusions of grandeur.”</p><p>The girl bristled but maintained her composure. “I am Hel. Just one L. The Vikings worshipped me as the embodiment of death.”</p><p>“Well, the Vikings were dumbasses then, ‘cause I’ve met capital-D Death, lady, and believe me, you aren’t him. But you’re not a teenage girl either, are you? You’re just using the doctor’s daughter as a meat suit. I’ve seen that trick before, too.”</p><p>Dean still felt weak as a half-drowned kitten, but he could feel his strength returning bit by bit. He wanted to keep Hel talking to give himself more time to recover. He glanced at Marshall. The doctor’s Frankenhubby stood staring at Hel, an empty expression on his face. Dean wondered if the man had enough beans left in his <em>cabeza</em> to recognize his daughter, and if so, somewhere inside his mind, was he shouting in anger at what had been done to her? Not that the good lady doctor seemed upset. From the way she was beaming at the goddess, it looked as if she was ready to join the First Church of Hel, get baptized, and run for Pope.</p><p>He glanced at Sam, but saw no change. He still lay there, unconscious or worse. Dean didn’t know if he could work a deal with Hel, but despite Sam’s warning against making pacts with dark powers, he had to try. His brother’s life depended on it.</p><p>He was trying to think up a good sales pitch when Hel turned to Conrad and placed a hand on his head.</p><p>“You may gaze upon me, my most good and loyal servant.”</p><p>She removed her hand and Conrad, trembling, raised his head to look at her. He made no move to stand.</p><p>“My lady. You are more beautiful than I ever could have imagined.” Tears of joy streamed down his cheeks. “To see you incarnated in flesh that will not wither before your dark power is the fulfillment of a dream I have carried for three centuries, ever since the day I first heard your voice as a child in Castle Frankenstein.”</p><p>She smiled lovingly down at him. “I reached out to many others before you, Conrad, but yours were the only ears that heard, the only mind brilliant enough to understand what I needed, and the only heart steadfast enough to find the courage to keep on striving through all the long years. And now, here we are.”</p><p>“Yes, my lady. I will never know a moment finer than this.”</p><p>Hel’s smile turned cold. “This is true.”</p><p>She pointed the stone at him, and a bolt of ebon energy shot forth and struck him in the chest. He stiffened, and his body began to age at a rapid rate, the centuries catching up with him in a second. His flesh wrinkled, became parchment-dry, and drew tight against his bones. His hair became white wisps that drifted away from his liver-spotted scalp and fell, decaying to nothing before they could hit the wooden deck. His eyes sank into his skull and vanished, and his lips pulled back from his teeth, creating a ghastly grin. He fell onto his side, and what remained of his body collapsed into dust. A moment later, that was gone too, and all that remained of Conrad Dippel, the insane alchemist who had inspired one of the most famous horror novels in the English language, along with scores of films, was an empty suit.</p><p>“What did you do that for?” Dean demanded. “Not that I’m sorry to see him go, but it’s a lousy way to repay three hundred years of devotion. The least you could’ve done is given him a gold watch or something.”</p><p>Hel shrugged. “He was a tool I was finished with, so I discarded him. I needed someone to serve as my agent in the physical world, but now that I have a suitable body, I need no one but myself.”</p><p>Hel continued to face him as she spoke, so she didn’t see the look on Catherine Luss’s face, but Dean did. The adoration was gone, replaced by confusion. <em>Mamma can’t wrap her head around what her little girl just did,</em> he thought. If Hel kept going like this, it wouldn’t take long for the spell she’d cast over the doctor to break. Once that happened, she was liable to get zapped by that weird blue stone of Hel’s and end up like Dippel.</p><p>Dean wasn’t close to his full strength again, but he thought he might be strong enough.</p><p>“You know, I was going to try to make a deal with you to save my brother’s life, but I get the feeling you aren’t really the dealing type.”</p><p>“You are correct. If I want something, I take it.” She grinned. “It was one of the reasons the Vikings were so fond of me. They thought like I do.”</p><p>“That’s what I figured. In that case...” Dean drew his Colt, aimed for the stone, and fired.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam stood on the shore of a vast dark ocean. The water looked like ink, the ground beneath his feet black ash. Fragments of ivory bone poked through in places, most unrecognizable, but Sam saw several skulls, hands, and feet. The sky was a canopy of roiling shadow that stretched from horizon to horizon, but despite the complete lack of illumination, he had no difficulty seeing. Waves rolled into shore, moving thick and slow, more like tar than water, and when they broke they made a sound like sandpaper scraping bare flesh.</p><p>The last thing he remembered was taking a shot at Marshall Luss. After that, nothing.</p><p>“Am I dead?” he wondered aloud.</p><p>“Nearly.”</p><p>Sam turned to see a man standing next to him. He looked to be in his mid-thirties, with short blond hair and a kind, gentle face. He wore a light blue button shirt and dark blue pants, and even though Sam had never seen him clearly before, he knew who he was.</p><p>“You’re the shadow figure I’ve been seeing.”</p><p>The man nodded. “The infection you acquired from the bite from Dippel’s hound made that possible. But you know that already.”</p><p>“What are you? A Reaper?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“So I <em>am</em> dead.” Sam took in the surreal landscape around them. “I have to say, I’ve been dead before, and I don’t remember it being anything like this.”</p><p>“The infection combined with the amount of stimulants you took proved too great a strain for your body. However, as I said, you’re only <em>nearly</em> dead. This...” He spread his arms. “...is a construct of your subconscious. And a most theatrical one at that.”</p><p>“So you’re here to shepherd me to the afterlife. I don’t suppose there’s any way I can talk you out of it?”</p><p>“I have come to take you away from here, but our destination isn’t eternity. We both have unfinished business back in the realm of the living.”</p><p>“Dippel,” Sam said.</p><p>“Not anymore. He’s been... dealt with. Unfortunately, the creature that he’s brought into corporeal existence is a far more dangerous threat than he could ever be. She is Hel, the Norse goddess of death, and she is using the body of Bekah Luss as her vessel. I was trapped in the Lapis Occultus, but your brother freed me, allowing me to come to this mindscape you created in order to retrieve you. I can return your spirit to your own body and even counteract the necro-mystical infection that has almost destroyed you, but other than that, I can offer no help. Hel is too powerful for me to confront directly, especially since Dippel used a measure of my own power to resurrect both Marshall and Bekah.” The man lowered his gaze to the ashen ground. “My capacity for acting in the physical world is limited, and I’d hoped to... use you and your brother to help me stop Dippel. If I could have thought of any other way...”</p><p>Sam didn’t quite follow everything the Reaper said, but he got the gist.</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. You were doing your job, just like we were doing ours. So, any advice for when I get back?”</p><p>“I’m only permitted to return you to life this one time because of the particular unnatural power that brought you to the edge of death. So my advice is, don’t die again.”</p><p>Sam smiled grimly. “I’ll do my best.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Sam opened his eyes. He felt better than he had in days, wide awake and full of energy, as if he’d just woken from the best night’s sleep he’d ever had. He still had hold of his Beretta, and he gripped it tight as he lifted his head slightly to survey the scene. Dippel was gone, nothing but an empty set of clothes to indicate he ever existed. A teenager he assumed was Bekah Luss—or at least her body—stood on the deck, cradling her right hand to her chest, an expression of venomous hatred on her face. Lying near her feet were scattered fragments of dark blue stone. The remnants of the Lapis Occultus, he assumed, whatever that was. Catherine Luss stood close to the creature that now wore her daughter’s form, looking lost and confused. Dean was getting to his feet, less than twenty feet away from Sam, facing Marshall Luss. He had his Colt drawn and aimed at the man, but Marshall seemed not to care. He snarled like an animal, but although his eyes blazed with fury, he made no move to attack Dean. The man’s hands and arms were no longer swathed in ebon energy—or rather, Sam could no longer see it. The Reaper had been true to his word. The infection was gone, but so was his death vision. He had to assume that Marshall was still capable of draining life force, which meant they had to keep him at bay, out of arm’s reach.</p><p>Sam took in all the details in an instant, along with one thing more: no one had noticed his restoration to the land of the living.</p><p><em>I’m sorry about this, Bekah,</em> he thought. He sat up and in one swift movement raised his Beretta and fired.</p><p>The girl’s head snapped back as the round penetrated her skull. Catherine Luss shouted, “No!” and rushed to her daughter’s side. But Bekah didn’t fall down. She straightened her head, and trained her gaze on Sam, a trickle of black blood running from the new hole in her forehead.</p><p>“You seem to have made a remarkable recovery, boy. I wonder if you had help.”</p><p>She held out her hand, and the bullet popped out of the hole and landed in her palm. She regarded it for a moment before turning her palm downward and allowing it to clatter to the deck.</p><p>“This body was created to be strong, and now that it is imbued with my power, it cannot be harmed by such simple means. You cannot stop me, hunter. My new servant will drain the life essence from both of you, then I shall animate your husks and make you the first recruits in my army of the dead.”</p><p>Dean didn’t take his eyes off Marshall as he said, “Nice shot. Good to have you back.”</p><p>“Good to be back. So we’ve got another rogue god on our hands, huh?”</p><p>“Can you believe it? The damned things are crawling out of the woodwork like cockroaches.”</p><p>“And it sounds like she plans to take over the world,” Sam added.</p><p>“Yeah. Big surprise. You ever wonder if these jokers actually give any thought to what they’d do with the world once they’ve conquered it? It’s a pretty big place.”</p><p>“Be a real bitch to keep clean,” Sam said.</p><p>Bekah’s features tightened with Hel’s anger. “I shall not permit such mockery. Marshall—kill them both.”</p><p>“Bad men!” Marshall growled, and then started toward Dean, hands raised. Although Sam could no longer see it, he knew black death energy radiated from them.</p><p>Dean was through fooling around. He fired his Colt twice, putting a round in each of Marshall’s legs. The man didn’t seem phased by the wounds, but his legs collapsed out from under him, sending him sprawling to the ground. Dean tucked the Colt into his pants and took hold of the flamethrower’s nozzle.</p><p>“This stuff might be diluted, but I’m betting it’s still got a spark or two left in it.” He thumbed the release button and pumped several streams of liquid onto Marshall. The man squeezed his eyes shut and sputtered as the watered-down kerosene splashed his face. He struggled to rise to his feet, blood pouring from the fresh wounds to his legs. Dean released the flamethrower’s nozzle and removed a flare from his jacket pocket. He pulled off the striking cap, lit it, and tossed the blazing flare onto Marshall.</p><p>Flames erupted across the man’s body, and although he’d seemed unaffected by gunshot wounds, this was a pain he was unable to withstand. He let out an ear-piercing howl of pure agony.</p><p>“Oh my god!” Catherine shrieked. “Marshall!”</p><p>Hearing his wife’s voice, Marshall staggered to his feet and lurched in the direction of the deck. Whatever difference the Lapis Occultus had made in the man’s resurrection, it hadn’t caused him to be any less flammable than Dippel’s other creations. Within seconds, Marshall had become a mobile bonfire, flames roaring and crackling, greasy smoke rising into the sky, filling the air with the gut-churning smell of burning flesh. He cried out in agony one more time before his voice cut out, destroyed by fire.</p><p>Catherine tried to go to him, but Hel grabbed her arm and stopped her.</p><p>She struggled to pull herself free from the creature inhabiting her daughter’s body. “Let me go! I’m a doctor!”</p><p>“I fear your husband is beyond all help, medical or mystical.” Hel flicked her hand toward Marshall and tendrils of ebon energy extended from her fingers. They struck Marshall like five black whips, and then retracted back into Hel’s flesh. Marshall stood still for a moment, flames burning furiously, then he fell to his knees and collapsed onto his side. He lay still as the fire continued to devour what was left of his flesh.</p><p>Hel released Catherine, and she whirled to face the dark goddess. “What did you do?”</p><p>“He had no need of what life force remained to him, so I took it. We gods no longer enjoy the high stations we once did, nor do we receive the offerings and sacrifices that are ours by divine right. Because of this, we’ve learned over the long, lean years not to waste resources. Or as your people would say, ‘waste not, want not.’” She smiled. “Of course, all of this will change once my darkness has cloaked your world in everlasting night. There are so many more of you now than there were during my time, and every one of you shall fall down and worship me. And if you refuse...” Her smile turned ice-cold. “...you’ll just fall down.”</p><p>While Hel spoke to Catherine, Dean walked over to Sam. “I don’t suppose you brought back any knowledge about how to defeat this bitch with you from the Other Side?”</p><p>“Afraid not.”</p><p>“You think if we put enough rounds in her, she’ll go down long enough for us to burn her?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It might work. If I remember right, the Norse viewed Hel’s domain as a realm of eternal ice and cold where those who died of sickness or old age were condemned.” When Dean gave him a questioning look, he added, “The Vikings preferred to die a glorious death in battle so they could get into Valhalla, the hall of heroes.”</p><p>“That’s the one where you fight all day and feast all night, right? Doesn’t sound half bad. So you’re thinking that fire is the opposite of ice, and if we give her a hotfoot, it might take her out. All right, let’s reload and put that theory to the test.”</p><p>“Don’t bother.”</p><p>They looked up to see Hel walking toward them. Catherine remained standing on the deck, watching, eyes filled with despair, sorrow etched on her face.</p><p>“I’m not deaf, you know,” she said with a smug smile. “While Niflheim is indeed a harsh frozen landscape, I am Death, and what is fire but the ultimate devourer, the ultimate killer? Flames cannot harm me.”</p><p>“I told you, I’ve met Death—“ Dean began.</p><p>“Fine,” Hel snapped. “So I’m <em>a</em> death, not <em>the</em> Death. You may think of me as his little sister, if it helps. Whatever I am, I’m more than a match for a pair of mortals like you.”</p><p>She stopped when she reached them. “Any last words before I turn you into my undead slaves?”</p><p>“I can think of a couple,” Dean said, “but I don’t think they’re appropriate to say to someone underage.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t certain, but he thought he heard a voice whisper next to his ear. It said, <em>Catherine.</em></p><p>Sam didn’t know what he was supposed to do, or if the voice was real or just another hallucination, so he just started talking and hoped something would come to him. “Catherine, I know you only wanted to bring your family back. The pain of losing someone you love... it’s indescribable. And no matter how much time passes, that pain never goes away, not completely. You think if only you could have a little more time with them, you’d say all the things you never got around to saying, do all the things you put off when they were alive. You pray for a miracle, and sometimes, one happens. In your case, Conrad found you, and with his help, you learned how to restore life to the dead. But when people come back, they’re not the same. Their personalities, their souls are gone, and what returns is... something else. My brother and I, we’ve seen it happen before. We knew a girl called Trish...” He trailed off. “My point is we watched someone we loved brought back as a horrible, murderous thing, and we had to—to make it right again.”</p><p>Catherine’s face gave no hint of whether Sam’s words had any impact on her, or indeed, if they’d registered at all.</p><p>Hel sneered at Sam. “How sentimental.” She raised her hands and tendrils of darkness began to emerge from her fingers.</p><p>Sam could feel Dean tense, and he knew his brother intended to go down shooting. It might not stop Hel, but it was better than standing there and letting her kill them without a fight. Neither of them had gotten a chance to reload, and he didn’t know how many rounds remained in his clip, but he didn’t care. Whatever he had left, he’d make sure they counted.</p><p>Before the brothers could begin firing, Catherine said, “Wait!”</p><p>She stepped off the deck and came walking toward them. She glanced at the remains of her husband. The flames had died away for the most part, leaving behind only a blackened, smoldering husk. Sam thought he saw her lips tighten, but otherwise her expression remained neutral as she joined them.</p><p>Sam exchanged a look with his brother. They couldn’t shoot now, not without hitting Catherine, too.</p><p>“Before this goes any farther, I want you to tell me something, Hel. I understand that you’re in control of Bekah’s body, and that your spirit is dominant, but is she anywhere inside? And if so, is she aware of what’s happening?”</p><p>The ebon tendrils slithered back into Hel’s fingers, and she turned to face Catherine. “If I say yes, will you follow me loyally and without question? Even though I no longer need an agent in the physical world, I have to admit that Conrad had his uses. You would make a suitable replacement.”</p><p>“If my daughter is within you, then yes, I will serve you.”</p><p>Hel smiled. “Of course she’s here. Can’t you tell?”</p><p>Catherine stepped closer and peered into Hel’s eyes. She stared for several moments, looking deeply, before finally nodding. “I can see her. She <em>is</em> in there.” She stepped back. “I am yours, Hel.” She smiled. “Till death do us part.”</p><p>Hel let out a laugh and then turned to face Sam and Dean. Once more the goddess raised her hands, and Sam knew they couldn’t wait any longer. They were going to have to start firing and hope Catherine didn’t catch a stray bullet.</p><p>Catherine reach into the pocket of her lab coat and withdrew something sharp and silvery. Sam had just enough time to realize it was a scalpel before she plunged it into the base of Hel’s skull. Hel’s eyes went wide, more from surprise than pain. Catherine flicked the scalpel’s blade back and forth with a single deft motion. Hel’s eyes rolled white. She collapsed to the ground, the scalpel handle still protruding from her skull.</p><p>Catherine, Sam, and Dean stood looking down at the body of Bekah Luss for several seconds. Then Catherine spoke in a toneless voice. “If you want to know death, study life. It’s why doctors make the best killers.”</p><p>“You severed the connection between her brain and spinal cord,” Sam said.</p><p>Catherine nodded. “I don’t know how long it will take Hel to heal the wound and restore life to Bekah’s body. I left the scalpel in place in the hope it will slow her down, at least a little. But as powerful as she is, she will heal. It’s just a matter of time.”</p><p>“We should burn her,” Dean said. “If Hel can’t work her mojo, fire should take care of her as easily as...” He glanced at Marshall’s charred remains. “...anything else.” He reached for the flamethrower’s nozzle.</p><p>“Not yet,” Catherine said. “There’s something we should do first—as insurance, if nothing else.”</p><p>“What’s that?” Sam asked.</p><p>She raised her eyes and regarded the Winchesters grimly. “Disassembly.”</p><p>Sam looked at Dean. In unison, they put away their pistols and reached for their KA-BAR knives.</p><h2><span id="chapter-15">CHAPTER 15</span><a href="#chapter-15" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’m getting tired of digging graves,” Dean said.</p><p>“Me, too.”</p><p>The crapmobile cruised through the night on I-70, heading west, Dean behind the wheel, Sam riding shotgun.</p><p>After they’d “disassembled” Bekah’s body, they’d burned the parts and buried them separately in the Luss’s back yard. When that chore was finished, they buried Marshall’s remains as well. The sun had long dropped below the horizon by that point, and Catherine invited them in for a drink. They accepted, feeling more than a little awkward. As they stood in her kitchen and drank tap water, she thanked them for their help.</p><p><em>What am I going to do now?</em> Catherine had asked. <em>I’ve done terrible things. I never asked where Conrad found the limbs and organs I needed, but I knew where they came from</em>—<em>especially the freshest ones. And the experiment that got loose, the dog... it killed people. Those deaths are on my hands, too. I may not have taken any lives directly, but I’m just as responsible as if I had. I don’t even have Dippel’s excuse of being manipulated by a dark goddess. I was just a sad, lonely woman who missed her family. I’d go to the police and turn myself in, but what good would it do? No one would believe my story.</em></p><p>The only physical evidence left was her homemade lab in the basement. She could lead the cops to the remains of Marshall and Bekah, but there was a chance that, like Frankenmutt and the Double-Header, they’d decay to nothing soon. Besides, she didn’t want anyone disturbing Bekah’s various graves, just in case doing so somehow freed Hel. They had no idea if the goddess’s spirit had returned to the realm it had come from—Sniffleham or something like that; Dean couldn’t remember—but none of them wanted to take any chances.</p><p><em>Start your practice back up,</em> Sam had suggested. <em>Return to helping people. Isn’t that why you became a doctor in the first place? Besides, what better way to fight death than by preserving life?</em></p><p>Catherine had thought for a moment. <em>I think... I think maybe Marshall and Bekah would like that. But should I? Is redemption even possible?</em></p><p>Dean had taken that one. <em>Doc, if we didn’t believe it is, we wouldn’t be able to get out of bed in the morning.</em></p><p>“Too bad the Lapis Occultus was destroyed,” Sam said. “I think it might have been another name for the Philosopher’s Stone, in which case it could’ve made a powerful weapon to use against Dick Roman.”</p><p>Dean shrugged. “No use crying over shattered mystical artifacts. I’m glad to see you’re feeling better, though. You finally manage to fight off that infection?”</p><p>Sam smiled. “Looks like it.” He crossed his leg and pulled up the cuff of his pants. “See? No more weird black veins.”</p><p>“That’s a relief. We’ll save a ton of money on coffee.” Dean paused before asking his next question. “You... seeing things?”</p><p>Sam tugged his pants cuff back down. “You mean like a strange shadow man? Don’t worry. I don’t think I’m going to see him anymore.”</p><p>Something about Sam’s tone made Dean think he was missing something, but he decided to let it go. “You think the doc is going to be okay?”</p><p>“I don’t know. We were raised in this life, and the stuff we go through still messes us up. I can’t imagine how much worse it is for a normal person. But if she starts seeing patients again, surrounds herself with life instead of brooding on death, I think she stands a chance.”</p><p>“In our business, sometimes a chance is all you need.”</p><p>They drove in silence for a while. Dean almost turned on the radio, but he decided against it. He didn’t feel like music just then.</p><p>After a time, Sam said, “I’ve been thinking.”</p><p>“There’s a shocker,” Dean said.</p><p>“Remember those dreams I had about Trish?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“It occurred to me that we never did anything about the Rifleman.”</p><p>Dean did some quick mental calculating. “It’ll only take thirty-five or forty hours to get to Washington State from here, assuming we drive straight through.”</p><p>“I’m wide awake,” Sam said, smiling.</p><p>Dean sniffed the air and caught a whiff of stink coming from the trunk.</p><p>“Maybe we should stop at a Laundromat and wash our funkified clothes first.”</p><p>“Let’s find a Dumpster to toss them into, and buy more when we get to Washington.”</p><p>“Sounds like a plan.”</p><p>The brothers continued traveling through the darkness.</p>]]></content>

The book that you currently hold in your hot little hands (or are reading virtually on your hot little tablet doo-hickey) was written by the <span class="italic">Supernatural</span> staff member who knows the inside of my sticky skull better than just about anybody. Better than Sera Gamble or Bob Singer, that’s for sure. You see, Rebecca has the unenviable job of my assistant. Which means she has to tolerate my bellowing rants, my hurling hot coffee in her face. Just kidding—I’m not really that kind of boss—more the compulsively neurotic type—a less photogenic Albert Brooks, if you will. But I digress. In truth, I interact with Rebecca more than anybody on the show—all my notes and drafts go across her desk, she performs crucial research, she contributes brilliant show ideas—and most of all, she sees how our grubby little series is made, from a catbird seat like no other. On top of it all—she’s smart. Damn smart. Damn good writer, too. And all of this adds up to the book (or hologram) you are currently grasping in your meathooks. I think you’ll enjoy the corner she’s staked out within our weird little universe. Because she lives inside that universe as much as any of us. Hell, maybe more. Anyway, have fun. And send a silent prayer to Rebecca—she needs it—after all, she’s got to put up with me.</p><p>Eric Kripke</p><p>Creator &amp; Executive Producer, <span class="italic">Supernatural</span></p><h2><span id="prologue-01">PROLOGUE 01</span><a href="#prologue-01" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Winter 1692</p><p>A pale sliver of crescent moon pinches at the sky. A lone pair of footsteps crunches over a snow-encased field. Through spindly black brush, a young girl emerges and makes her way over the frozen earth. Her full black skirts scrape hieroglyphic shapes into the powdery snow. She stops and studies the ground before her; a covered mound pushes upwards from the earth. Scraping off the moss with her mitten-covered hands she reveals a grave. Despite the cold she proceeds to kneel down before it.</p><p>From beneath her coat she takes out a folded piece of purple fabric. Unwrapping the triangles of cloth, she lays it ceremonially on the frozen earth. Out of her pockets, she produces various objects and sets them precisely on the shroud. Faint moonlight glints off a silver outline of the pentagram extending to the corners. The girl pulls forth several black candles, fighting the wind as she lights them.</p><p>Into a small brass bowl she drops various feather pieces, stone, crystal, and herbs. Then she pulls a small dagger from her coat and presses the blade against her palm. Wincing slightly she slices the soft skin from her index finger to the base. Blood drips into the bowl covering the objects.</p><p>From her pocket she produces a worn book, two fists thick. Nervously, she lays it on her lap, brushing the pages apart with her gloved hands. Her voice wavers as she starts to chant, softly at first, tracing the words with her finger as she reads.</p><p>The wind whips up, steadily increasing to a screaming gale. The girl shades her eyes from the blowing snow but continues to chant over the howl of the cold air. The flakes before her begin to gather, as if attracted to one another by an unseen force, becoming denser and denser. The whirlwind slowly takes on a shape.</p><p>With each howl of the wind more snow coagulates until the figure of a woman solidifies before the girl. The girl peers up at the tall figure. A faint gasp escapes her blue lips. Her eyes move over the vestige of rotting flesh before her. She bows.</p><p>“Madam. I’ve missed you so. I serve only you.”</p><p>The specter’s glassy, dead eyes seem not to register the plea.</p><p>The girl continues. “I’ve done exactly as instructed. I’ve tried so very hard.” She wipes away a small dribble of mucus from her nose. “Council me. I know not how to make more provisions for him.”</p><p>The corners of the specter’s mouth turn upwards into a curdled smile.</p><p>“Why child, know what ye must. Raise us all.”</p><p>The color drains from the girl’s face.</p><p>“I... What if I cannot?” Her tear-streaked face turns upwards. “I’m not as strong as you.”</p><p>The specter’s lips prune into a rotten scowl. Raising her arm, she gives a quick flick of her wrist. The girl catches her breath as if someone startled her from behind. Her hands fly to her throat as a phantom grip tightens down onto her doe-sized neck. Blood rims her corneas, she fails to draw a breath.</p><p>The woman leans down, eye to eye with the girl.</p><p>“Well then, if you cannot do it, I will find someone else.”</p><p>She slowly turns her hand. The girl’s eyes dilate to saucers as the vertebra in her neck go POP, POP, POP, snapping like chicken bones.</p><p>At that moment, from behind, a dark figure emerges from the tree line. She approaches the girl silently, produces a knife and with one hand grabs the girl’s neck as the blade slices across her throat. Her small body falls limp into the snow, lifeless dark eyes staring out across the white expanse.</p><p>The pages of the old tome flap like the wings of a downed bird.</p><p>The figure holds the knife downward as blood drips from its blade. She picks up the book and continues the incantation as the blood petals over the white snow; spreading and soaking the purple cloth.</p><p>“Deviser of Darkness, <span class="italic">imus adque deportamus...”</span></p><p>As the woman continues the chant, the specter darkens and materializes. With each word the figure becomes more corporeal: Her limbs take shape. The rancid skin on her face smoothes and tightens. Her rotting, torn clothes repair themselves.</p><p>The woman stops chanting, and looks at the creature before her.</p><p>“Dear mother, I’ve missed you so.”</p><p>The old woman nods, and the two walk off across the field together.</p><p>Snow wafts over the young girl’s dead body. Gradually, the snow covers the slight figure, blending it into the white landscape.</p><h2><span id="prologue-02">PROLOGUE 02</span><a href="#prologue-02" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>2010</p><p>Dean and Sam swig from a bottle as they barrel-ass down a dark country road. Dean cranks the tunes. Sam smiles and lays back into the Impala’s passenger seat. All is right with the world.</p><p>“How long till we get there?” Sam asks.</p><p>Dean casts a sidewards glance at Sam. “Dude, you’re my personal Garmin, figure it out.”</p><p>Dean smiles, he loves making Sam feel like the little brother. But Sam doesn’t respond.</p><p>“You’re my co-pilot. Just without the uniform.”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>“Sam? You in there? When are we going to get there?” Dean asks, a flicker of concern on his face.</p><p>Sam turns toward Dean.</p><p>“We’ll never get there, Dean. It’s over. All over. I’m gone.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean woke with a start. His flailing arm hit the quarter-full glass of Scotch on the bedside table. A brown spot on the cream-colored sisal rug widened to a stain. <span class="italic">Crap.</span></p><p>Hefting himself up off the bed Dean reached for the towel that was draped over the chair by the window. But as his feet hit the ground, the sheets wrapped around his ankles, impeding his progress. Tied and tripped up, he landed on his face.</p><p>“Perfect, another kick-ass way to start the day, Dean,” he muttered to himself.</p><p>The bedroom door creaked open. Dean studied the pair of feet sporting nicely painted toenails that moved into his eyeline. He looked up. Lisa Braeden stood over him with a pitying smile on her face. Dean had grown quite accustomed to the expression that he induced almost every time they spoke. It was the same face Dean was met with when six weeks ago he showed up on her doorstep, after God knows how many years. They hadn’t been serious, it was just a couple of dates, years ago. But Dean and Sam had come to her rescue when her housing development had been taken over by a serious case of deadly child-nappers.</p><p>“Nice to see you made it this far out of bed today. That’s farther than any day this week.”</p><p>Bleary-eyed, Dean nodded. This is his life.</p><h2><span id="chapter-one">CHAPTER ONE</span><a href="#chapter-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“I’ll make you some eggs,” Lisa said as she picked up a pair of jeans from the floor. “We’re going to Morse Reservoir today, if you want to come.”</p><p>Dean heaved himself back onto the bed.</p><p>“No thanks. I’ll just stay here.”</p><p>Lisa’s eyes flicked over Dean’s unshaven face.</p><p>“Why don’t you come? It might be fun. Remember fun?”</p><p>Dean smiled tightly, the levity of the conversation almost making him nauseous.</p><p>“Besides, you haven’t talked to Ben in a week.” Lisa sat on the bed next to Dean, taking his hand in hers. “I don’t mind you staying in our spare room, but it’s like living with a ghost. I told you I wasn’t going to push you—“</p><p>“You’re right, you did.” Dean cut in, immediately regretting his tone. “I’m sorry. I’m trying.”</p><p>“I know you are. So am I. That’s why I’m asking you if you want to go to the park.”</p><p>She brushed the light hairs on the back of Dean’s hand. The pure emotion made his stomach twist.</p><p>Dean withdrew his hand from Lisa’s.</p><p>“Give me a couple minutes.”</p><p>Lisa pursed her lips, as though she wanted to say more. Instead, she kissed Dean on the cheek and stood up. At the door she turned and held up Dean’s discarded jeans.</p><p>“Just in case you care to join us, I’m going to throw these in the wash.”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>Lisa closed the door to Dean’s room, slowly clicking the lock. She stood there for a moment wondering whether she had made a mistake when Dean came to her front door and she let him into her and her son’s life. Ben was twelve, impressionable and sensitive. She knew deep down how kind and generous Dean was, but she also knew that the years of hunting had calloused his ability to commit himself emotionally. She thought that perhaps she could get through to him. Two months on, she wondered if she had done the right thing. Emotionally, Dean was an out-of-control rollercoaster with faulty brakes. It was only a matter of time before he ran off the rails.</p><p>Dean sat on the edge of the bed, then lay back and closed his eyes. In his head he played over again the vision of Sam jumping into the pit of Hell: the fiery opening swirling and writhing in the middle of the cemetery. He had been there for his brother, but there hadn’t been anything he could do to stop him. Talk about being impotent. Sam <span class="italic">had</span> to jump, but an acidy feeling of regret constantly swirled in Dean’s stomach. He should have stopped him. But there wasn’t any other way. Every so often, like every two minutes, Dean’s heart would palpitate and leap into his throat. The reality was constantly there, Dean’s brain wouldn’t let it go: Sam was gone forever.</p><p>The smoky Scotch he drank in large gulps helped his cause. But frequently, mid-morning, after Ben had gone to school and Lisa had left to teach an early morning yoga class in Carmel, Dean’s mind would clear enough so that once again he remembered, moment by moment, Sam jumping into the pit.</p><p>There had been no other way to save the world. Sam had said “yes,” and Lucifer had taken over Sam’s body. The plan rested on the tenuous idea that Sam could somehow gain enough consciousness that he could hurl himself, with Lucifer within him, into the hole. The brothers had collected all four horsemen’s rings—Death gave Dean his ring outright—and together the rings opened up the portal to Hell.</p><p>But it didn’t go down like that. They weren’t able to get Lucifer into the portal. As was their fate, Lucifer and Michael met on the battlefield, ready to duke it out. The collateral damage would only be a few hundred million lives, and no one would need Pay-Per-View for this fight, it was going to be right outside everyone’s front door.</p><p>But on that field, in the middle of the fight, somehow Sam had gained enough control of his own body, while possessed by Lucifer, to hurl himself into the cage. And there he would stay for eternity.</p><p>With that act, a hole had opened up in Dean’s soul and there was no way to fill it. The Scotch only anesthetized him for a few hours. After that, the thoughts would come flooding back. The panicky guilt would set in and Dean would race down the stairs to the kitchen looking for everything and anything to drink in order to knock himself out again.</p><p>Once, Lisa had found him on the kitchen floor in just his boxers: a bottle of cough syrup spilled onto the linoleum beside him, a glass smashed on the floor and several shards embedded in his feet. Lisa had patiently brought him upstairs and put him into the shower then waited until he had sobered up enough to get into bed.</p><p>The next morning when Dean woke, Lisa was perched on the side of his bed watching him.</p><p>“Not your finest moment yesterday,” she said.</p><p>“Yeah, sorry about that. Maybe it wasn’t the best idea coming here.”</p><p>“Maybe, but I want you to get better, Dean.”</p><p>Dean drew his fingers across his brow and pinched them together.</p><p>“I don’t think you can get better from something like this. That’s why I should probably leave.” Dean made a move to get out of bed.</p><p>“You’re not leaving. You can stay here as long as you want. But you have to make the decision if you want to move past this.”</p><p>“You can’t just move on from something like this, Lis. I let him do it.”</p><p>“There was no other way. Remember you said that? I can’t forgive you, Dean. You have to do that on your own.” Lisa got up and turned at the door. “You couldn’t have done anything else.”</p><p>Dean shook his head. “I’m not so sure about that.”</p><p>“No one could have.” Lisa’s hand hovered over the doorknob. “I’ll bring you up some coffee.” She shut the door, leaving Dean with his heart beating in his ears.</p><p>Day by day, Dean had started to rejoin the ranks of the living: he got up a little earlier rather than sleeping until noon, at night he would join Lisa and Ben while they were watching TV, still with a bottle close to hand, but drinking a little less every day.</p><p>Dean’s relationship with Lisa thrived through Dean’s self-imposed confinement.</p><p>“I know how to do laundry, Lisa.” Dean leaned against the washing machine as Lisa separated out the whites and coloreds.</p><p>“No. You don’t. Everything you wear is that same olive grey because you don’t separate your whites and coloreds.”</p><p>Dean looked down at his olive-gray T-shirt. She had a point. “I like this color,” he said. “I look good in it.”</p><p>“It’s fatigue green. Let’s go get you something in blue or even red.”</p><p>“I’m not wearing red. It’s a shade of pink.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Lisa said, smiling as she leaned over to grab the laundry detergent, her face a few inches from Dean’s.</p><p>Dean looked into her dark eyes and grabbed her arm. A pull inside of him wanted to do more, to hold her. But he just couldn’t.</p><p>“I don’t want to mess up your life,” he said.</p><p>“You’re not. And I won’t let you. Now let me go. I have to put in the fabric softener ball.”</p><p>“What the hell is that?”</p><p>Lisa grabbed the powder-blue ball, snapped off the cover and poured fabric softener into the hole.</p><p>“What does that do?” Dean asked, genuinely perplexed.</p><p>“Fabric softener, to make your clothes softer.” Lisa smirked.</p><p>“I didn’t know that was really a thing. Making clothes softer.”</p><p>“Oh young Jedi, I have so much to teach you.” Lisa slammed the washer shut, spun the dial and gave Dean a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>It was the first moment of levity that Dean had felt for weeks. But even as Dean’s life normalized, thoughts about Sam haunted him.</p><p>“Never thought I would see you reading a self-help book.”</p><p>Dean opened his eyes. He had fallen asleep on the couch in the living room. On his chest a copy of <span class="italic">Chicken Soup for the Soul</span> was flipped open. That night Lisa had said, “Why don’t you read this?” She pulled it from a shelf and handed it to Dean. “It helped me when my grandmother died.” Dean accepted the book reluctantly, but after reading a couple of pages he sort of got into it.</p><p>Sam leaned over and pulled the book from Dean’s chest.</p><p>“‘101 stories to open the heart and rekindle the spirit’? Really Dean? That’s lame, even for you.”</p><p>Dean peered at his brother through sleepy eyes. Sam stood before him in bloody clothes, with his face looking like a wild animal had ravaged it. Sam’s lip had been torn—more like bitten off—his teeth peeked through beneath. His left ear had shriveled and darkened and on his left arm a swath of skin peeled from shoulder to wrist. His body had been scorched from top to bottom, layers of raw skin stuck to his clothes in slick black patches.</p><p>On some level, Dean knew he was imagining his brother standing before him. His dreams had been tormenting him like hounds. This evening was no exception.</p><p>“Sam.”</p><p>“Long time no see, bro. Of course, as you can see, I’m having some trouble. They burned my eyes with pokers. I can only really get a good look at you if I go like this.” Sam turned his head slightly to the side. His eyes were scarred into cataracts. Dean winced. Sam swung around, checking out the room. “Nice place. Comfy. Lot nicer than where I am. ‘Course it’s a little different for me down there being pulled apart fiber by fiber by a thousand rabid demons. No worries, though. I’m glad <span class="italic">you’re</span> comfortable up here.”</p><p>“It’s not like that, Sam. I tried. What else am I supposed to do? Cass is gone. How am I going to get to you?”</p><p>“No. I get it, Dean. Don’t worry about me. I’ll be okay. I’m fine being barebacked by Lucifer every second for the next couple of hundred millennia.”</p><p>“I would do anything to get you out.”</p><p>“You sure about that? It looks to me like you are just doing what you always wanted.” Sam growled, but the force of the movement proved too much. He shook his head and spit a molar out into his hand. “Never did get my wisdom teeth out. They’re taking care of that right now.”</p><p>Dean was now up off the couch, face to face with the specter of his brother.</p><p>“Sam, you told me to come here to Lisa’s. Remember? Barbecues, football games.”</p><p>Sam winced.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Oh nothing, just a pesky demon who keeps playing the Operation game with my liver. I lost my funny bone first, wouldn’t you know. Maybe that would have helped me get through this with a sense of humor.”</p><p>“Sam, tell me what I can do. There has to be someone down there that knows how to break you out.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about me. Have a good life, Dean.”</p><p>With that, Sam vanished.</p><p>Dean woke up in a cold sweat. His hands had clenched the book so tightly, the paperback was waded into a ball. The room was empty.</p><p>Dean swung his heels to the floor and hung his head. He felt as if someone had reached inside and pulled out his intestines through his eyes. The excruciating pain, the guilt, was beyond anything he had ever experienced.</p><p>He heard footsteps and looked up to see Lisa appear at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>“You okay? I heard you scream,” she said anxiously.</p><p>“I’m fine. Go back to sleep.” Sweat dripped down his forehead.</p><p>Lisa walked across the room and sat down next to Dean on the couch.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” she insisted gently.</p><p>“Lisa, please. I’m fine.”</p><p>“We talked about you seeing someone before.”</p><p>“I’m not seeing a psychiatrist. I’m fine. Really.”</p><p>Lisa nodded and then left him alone.</p><p>Lisa had been trying to get him to see a therapist since he showed up. It was part of the normal mourning process, she told Dean. Not that the Winchester family had ever had a <span class="italic">normal</span> mourning process. It seemed to Dean as if they had died and come back so many times. Dean wondered how long it would be until he finally <span class="italic">did</span> crack. Until his soul finally fractured under all the pain he had seen, caused, and felt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-two">CHAPTER TWO</span><a href="#chapter-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“It’s normal to feel guilty when a family member passes, especially under extraordinary circumstances. Your brother died how, exactly?” Dr. Hodes took off her glasses and peered at Dean, slouched on the patterned couch opposite her.</p><p>“Um. Mining accident. We were both miners and he fell into a pit.”</p><p>“Terribly sorry. That’s an awful way to pass.”</p><p>“Yeah. It is. Listen Doc—“</p><p>“You can call me Linda.”</p><p>“Linda. I just need to know when this is going to go away. I’m putting my girl—well, my friend through hell. I’m staying at her place and I just need to be set straight again.”</p><p>“Dean, I’m sorry, things don’t work that way. We live in the real world where no magic power is going to restore your brother or take away your pain. What we need to focus on is why you have this guilt.”</p><p>“How about angels?”</p><p>“Excuse me?”</p><p>“Nothing. I’m sorry. I think this was a waste of time.” Dean rose from the couch and dug into his pockets.</p><p>“Dean, why don’t you sit down? Let’s talk about how therapy might help you so it doesn’t feel like the weight of the world is on you and you alone.”</p><p>“It’s not anymore, Linda. It was on my brother and he took care of that. Thanks for your time.” Dean pulled a wad of cash from his pocket, counted out some bills and placed them on the coffee table. He then grabbed his jacket and left the office.</p><p>When Lisa returned home that night Dean was on the couch surrounded by a pile of books.</p><p>“I see you found the library,” she said putting down her purse and peering into the kitchen. “Where’s Ben?”</p><p>“He’s in bed,” Dean said flipping a page. “We ate macaroni and cheese, watched <span class="italic">30 Rock,</span> then he conked out.”</p><p>“So what’s all this?” Lisa already could tell she was going to regret asking the question.</p><p>“Um. Nothing really.”</p><p>“So you’re just doing some light reading?” Lisa picked up a Carl Sagan book, then put it down. “Why, Dean?”</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Because I want to know that I’ve exhausted every possible way of getting him out of there.”</p><p>“By what? Turning back time? I mean this is...” Lisa looked around wide-eyed. “This is even a little too much for me.”</p><p>Dean set down the book he was reading.</p><p>“I tried it your way; Dr. Melfi didn’t work. Let me exhaust this as one last option. Please?”</p><p>Lisa shrugged, what else could she do. These past weeks Dean had seemed more connected to her and Ben. If he needed to do a little reading, perhaps it wasn’t the worst thing in the world.</p><p>“Okay. I’m going to bed. Night,” she said.</p><p>“Night,” Dean said, already engrossed in another book.</p><p>“You know I’m not coming back,” Sam said. The light from oncoming cars flickered over his face.</p><p>“Yeah. I’m aware.” Dean clenched his jaw.</p><p>“So you’ve got to promise me something.”</p><p>“Okay. Yeah. Anything.”</p><p>“You got to promise not to try to bring me back.”</p><p>Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. What awaited Sam in Hell made Dean’s time down there look like the ball pit in a McDonald’s playground; fun but a little smelly. It wasn’t going to be the same for Sam. Sam was going to get the royal treatment. He would be toast. Dean couldn’t just let his brother rot in Hell.</p><p>“So, what am I supposed to do?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You go find Lisa. You pray she’s dumb enough to take you in. You go have barbeques. And you go to football games. You go live some normal apple pie life, Dean. Promise me,” Sam said, looking at his brother.</p><p>Far away lights blinked in and out over the cornfields of Michigan as the Impala raced past. They were rocketing toward their destiny. Sam knew it. Dean knew it.</p><p>Dean’s throat was dry. He wasn’t supposed to even <span class="italic">try</span> to get his brother back?</p><p>Dean lay in bed for twenty minutes staring at the ceiling, thinking about Sam. Downstairs he could hear Lisa and Ben getting ready to go to the reservoir. Dean knew life was precious, at any point they could go and most likely be gone forever. Then somehow whatever was holding Dean back, the bind finally dissolved. A weight lifted off him. Dean decided he should join Lisa and Ben. He would do this for Sam.</p><p>“Hey, buddy,” Dean greeted Ben gruffly as he appeared in the kitchen doorway freshly showered and shaved.</p><p>Ben looked up from his breakfast. He beamed an accepting smile at Dean.</p><p>“Hey. Are you coming with us today?”</p><p>Lisa looked over from the stove, a wordless communication passed between them and Dean nodded. She understood him. Her limitless patience and acceptance was not the only thing Dean appreciated. As Lisa turned back toward the scrambled eggs Dean couldn’t help but admire her tightly jean-clad backside. He quickly turned his attention to Ben.</p><p>“What’s on the agenda at the park?”</p><p>“Fishing,” Ben said, devouring the last bit of toast. “But I’m always the one that has to hook the worms for Mom.”</p><p>“I’m squeamish with anything squishy,” Lisa said, glancing over her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, we can’t have that,” Dean said, taking a place on a stool next to Ben. “I mean, it’s every man for themselves when it comes to fishing. Right Ben?”</p><p>“I’ve tried to teach her, but it’s useless.”</p><p>“I have a Winchester method that my father taught me.” Dean lightly tapped Ben on the arm. “We’ll get your mom up to speed. Next thing you know she’ll be on <span class="italic">Bass Masters.”</span></p><p>Lisa set down some eggs, toast and a cup of coffee in front of Dean.</p><p>“I’m not going to be on <span class="italic">Bass Masters.”</span></p><p>Dean took a scoop of eggs.</p><p>“If I had known there was this type of service around here, I might have come downstairs more often,” he said.</p><p>Lisa smiled. “The chef serves, the eaters wash up.”</p><p>Dean made a face at Ben.</p><p>“I cleaned up last night,” Ben said, taking his plate to the sink. “That means it’s your turn.”</p><p>Lisa leaned over the counter and sipped at her coffee. She chided, “Gotta pull your own weight around here.”</p><p>Dean shoveled more eggs into his mouth. He might be able to do that.</p><p>“Ben, go get ready. Pull the tackle box and rods from the garage and set them out front. Okay?” Lisa said.</p><p>“Okay.” Ben slid off the stool and disappeared through the laundry-room door leading to the garage.</p><p>A silence fell between Dean and Lisa. She put her hand on his knee.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Dean set down his fork and peered into Lisa’s dark eyes. He gently brushed a lock of hair from her forehead. Dean had been sleeping in Lisa’s guest room for two months and never once had she asked why Dean had chosen her.</p><p>“Lisa, Sam told me to come here. To be with you.”</p><p>“Are you telling me you’re only here because Sam told you to come?”</p><p>“No. Initially, I didn’t know where else to go. But also, yes, because he wanted me to be with you. Because even if I didn’t want to admit it, he knew I wanted a life where I didn’t have to worry if there’s something around the corner ready to jump me. Sam knew me better than I knew myself. I’m sorry. I should have told you this weeks ago.”</p><p>“I don’t care if you’re here because Sam said so. You wouldn’t have stayed unless you wanted to. Right?”</p><p>Dean nodded.</p><p>“Then I guess it means you want to stay. Maybe you should start accepting that, rather than beating yourself up about it. Moving forward isn’t a bad thing, Dean. And if you want to move forward with me and Ben, well... I’m willing to try that. You get what I’m saying?”</p><p>Dean understood. Even though the very fabric of his soul resisted the idea that he deserved good things, perhaps he couldn’t suffer any longer. There wasn’t anything he could do for Sam now except what he had asked: to be happy with Lisa.</p><h2><span id="chapter-three">CHAPTER THREE</span><a href="#chapter-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Moo shoo pork?” Dean called. He pulled the food container from the box on the kitchen table.</p><p>“That’s mine,” Ben yelled, racing from the living room to the kitchen, “and I want white rice.”</p><p>“Brown rice. It’s better for you.” Lisa said, spooning rice onto a plate for Ben.</p><p>“Okay, whatever.” Ben grabbed the plate and carried it back to his position in front of the television.</p><p>“Whoa, what’s the rush?” Dean asked over his shoulder.</p><p>Ben turned up the sound.</p><p>“Not so loud,” Lisa called, taking her place across the dinner table from Dean. She smiled as Dean cracked open a beer and dug into his chow mein.</p><p>“Not a bad place,” Dean said, between bites.</p><p>“And you wanted to go to the Golden Palace again.” Lisa smiled. “I don’t know why you like it so much. You think that waitress is cute, don’t you?”</p><p>“She doesn’t have anything on you,” Dean said, picking up Lisa’s free hand and kissing her palm.</p><p>The last couple of weeks with Dean had been, if anything, simply idyllic: Dean had found a job refurbishing old buildings in nearby towns, and he was even cooking every once in a while. Life with Dean was great, even after everything they had been through in the beginning. Lisa never thought that Dean would walk back into her life, but here he was. It was strange. Years ago she had resigned herself to being a single mother. She had practically mastered being a single parent: she went to Ben’s softball games, covered the parent/teacher conferences, stayed up late with Ben when he had the stomach flu. She handled a lot: the carpooling, lugging sports equipment, even the science projects which she never really understood. Lisa did it all. But it was the loneliness she felt at night that made her really want a partner. Then Dean showed up and all that changed.</p><p>Dean had never lived a normal life except those first years in Lawrence, Kansas before his mother was killed. Life with Lisa was exactly what he had imagined domesticity to be. There was no denying it; Dean was happy. He was like a regular guy: he had bought a truck and retired the Impala, and had even taken Ben to a couple of Indianapolis Indians baseball games.</p><p>Lisa had introduced Dean to the next-door neighbors. As summer approached cookouts became commonplace and Dean wholeheartedly took part in all suburbia had to offer.</p><p>On those summer nights Dean manned the grill while the neighborhood kids and Ben ran around menacing everyone with super soakers. And as the spring days dripped away into nights buzzing with the sound of cicadas, Dean’s dreams about Sam stopped. For the first time in months Dean had slept through the night.</p><p>“You’ve got to help me, sis!” An inflated music score of a network show blared out from the television.</p><p>“Ben. Turn it down!” Lisa pulled her chair around and stared at the back of Ben’s head. He was thoroughly engrossed and ignored the command. Lisa sprang to her feet.</p><p>“I’ll get it.” Dean stuffed an egg roll into his mouth and crossed to the living room. “Ben, your mom is talking to you.”</p><p>Ben nodded but didn’t make a move. Picking up the remote, Dean pointed it at the TV to turn down the volume.</p><p>“Carrissa, please.” On the screen a blonde clad in black leather pants was being whipped around by an invisible force. “Use the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>!”</p><p>A brunette girl flipped through the elaborate pages of a large grimoire. “I’m trying. Here it is!” She began a Latin incantation. The wind subsided and the blonde dropped to the floor. The girls—sisters, Dean gathered—hugged each other. They had just escaped some sort of supernatural force and both of them wanted to go home. But how would they hide this from their mother? The two girls quipped a couple of lines of tween banter.</p><p>“What’s this?” Dean asked.</p><p>“It’s a new show. It’s about two teenage witches.” Ben blushed a bit. “But they’re badass, not like stupid witches.”</p><p>“What’s it called?”</p><p><span class="italic">“Spell Bound.”</span></p><p><span class="italic">“Spell Bound,</span> huh?” Dean sat down, and paused the show.</p><p>On screen, the book they called the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> hovered in digital stasis. During all of his obsessing over the past couple of months Dean hadn’t thought about the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>The book had been thought to be a work of fiction by twentieth-century occultist and novelist H.P. Lovecraft. A Wikipedia search could bring up enough facts about it to make any Hollywood screenwriter seem sufficiently knowledgeable about the work; thus its appearance in the pop-song scored, tween show of which Ben was a fan.</p><p>But in truth, the book had existed over millennia, though it had been called a couple of different things: <span class="italic">The Red Dragon, The Great Grimoire.</span> These texts had all been combined, picked apart, then combined again. But the original text was thought to have come from one man, some seven hundred years before Christ’s birth in Sumeria, what is now Iraq. It had been recopied, abridged and added to over centuries. The original was in an ancient form of Arabic, but it was later translated into Latin, Greek, German, and French by other scholars, monks, and priests.</p><p>The book contained ancient rights and spells with which to bind gods, which were in actuality demons. When the book was translated by Christians it was interpreted with less mysticism and more religion. The unorthodox nature of the text made many Christian scholars nervous, so they added locks and safety measures into the text, but it still stayed powerful.</p><p>Despite the changes made to the incantations, the text included spells for necromancy, raising the dead, the binding of demons, and mastery over the earthbound. If someone knew what they were doing the book was as potent as the day it was written. But there was one spell in particular—the only spell in the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> which Dean was interested in—a spell that could raise Lucifer.</p><p>The brothers had toiled to get Lucifer into the cage, but the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was written to release Lucifer and bind him—a whole different story to raising Lucifer and starting the Apocalypse. It had never been done before because all sixty-six seals had to have been broken. But Sam had taken care of that and that meant that, in theory at least, Lucifer could now be raised and bound.</p><p>If Dean could get Lucifer out of Hell, he would be getting Sam out of the cage as well. Lucifer would no longer have to fight Michael, so he might have lost his spunk and perhaps could be lassoed silent for enough time for Dean to expel Lucifer from his brother’s body. But the first step would be freeing Lucifer.</p><p>Dean thought about where he could find a complete enough version of the book. The brothers had run into a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> a couple of times, though usually only abridged, watered-down, fit-for-public-consumption pamphlets. An elementary version of the book had been used by the teens who had switched Sam into the body of a suburban geek a couple of years ago. It was witchcraft all right, but the pesky, pimpled kids had probably picked up their copy in a head shop.</p><p>The actual <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> was locked up in a cloister somewhere in Europe. Chances were that H.P. Lovecraft had made most of his version up, since reading from the actual text is often fatal—it can only be used by someone very practiced and powerful. Dean was pretty sure that Amazon wasn’t selling the originals. He had to find a real one.</p><p>And then who would help him cast the spell? He needed someone who knew how to handle powerful magic. Witches and those who practice witchcraft had used the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and texts like it since ancient cultures developed an alphabet. The lineage of the sorcerers familiar with the book trickled down from ancient Sumeria to today. But where was Dean going to find a witch? He couldn’t ask Bobby to point him in the right direction, and he and Sam had ganked every other witch that they had encountered. Finding a witch that was powerful enough and willing to help Dean might be difficult in Cicero, Indiana.</p><p>Dean sat down next to Ben, who again commandeered the remote.</p><p>“You want more?” Lisa called to Dean. “If not I’m saving it for leftovers.”</p><p>Dean didn’t answer, he was thinking about his brother.</p><h2><span id="chapter-four">CHAPTER FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam peered at the house through the Impala’s rain-splattered windshield. They had followed their mark home, but there hadn’t been any movement since he went inside.</p><p>“What do you think he’s doing in there?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What else would a guy who has killed everyone in his family be doing?” Dean said.</p><p>“You think he did it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Totally. You’re such a softy, Sam. You think he’s in there making a fluffer-nutter and sitting down to watch <span class="italic">Frontline</span>? No, he’s getting ready to go out and eat more human flesh. He’s the last man standing. Of course he did it. He’s gotta be a rugaru or a shapeshifter or something.”</p><p>Sam wasn’t so sure. Granted, Nick Warner <span class="italic">had</span> been found in the house where all three of his family members were found dead. But he claimed that he was sleeping and didn’t hear anything. Plus, the police had cleared him. However, in all of Sam and Dean’s travels they had come across stranger things. It could be a case of amnesia. Certainly in werewolf cases they had encountered the infected people didn’t remember anything when they turned back. Maybe Nick Warner didn’t remember killing his family.</p><p>“We have to just wait and see.”</p><p>“Well, I’ve had enough, I’m going in,” Dean said as he kicked open the car door and grabbed his sawed-off from the back seat.</p><p>“Dean, wait. What’re you gonna do? Just walk into the guy’s house? That’s breaking and entering,” Sam said, following closely behind his brother, shotgun in hand.</p><p>“Not the way I do it. The way I do it, it’s just breaking.”</p><p>Dean stomped up the steps and yelled, “Nick Warner, we know you’re in there. Come out with your hands up or we’re coming to get you!”</p><p>“What are you going to do when he comes out and sees you’re not the police, Kojak?” Sam asked.</p><p>Dean ran his fingers through his hair. “Just let me handle that pa—“</p><p>A horrible scream came from inside the house. Followed by the sound of breaking furniture.</p><p>“Watch out!” Dean cried.</p><p>He stepped back, then hurled his shoulder into the door. The lock splintered away, revealing the dark interior beyond.</p><p>“Mr. Warner? Nick Warner?” Sam called.</p><p>The house had fallen silent. Dean motioned that he was going to check the back rooms, and he indicated that Sam should sweep the upper floors. As Sam crept up the stairway, a dark streak crossed quickly before him. A door slammed at the top of the landing. Sam stood before the door with his shotgun at the ready, then slowly turned the door handle and entered the room.</p><p>On the bed a nasty old crone crouched over a tied and bound man, who Sam assumed to be Nick Warner. She was up to her elbows in Nick, her hand jammed into his mouth. Nick was turning blue. She was trying to tear out his heart.</p><p>Sam pulled the trigger back and aimed at the crone’s back. But she was quick. In moments, the old hag humped on top of him and overpowered his large frame. He struggled beneath her weight, her putrid breath wet his face with corpse-smelling saliva.</p><p>“Dean!” Sam yelled.</p><p>The crone was stronger than her bony body suggested. Both Sam’s arms were pinned to the floor. She bent down and examined Sam’s face. Sam half expected her to tell him how pretty he was. Instead she said, “I’m going to eat your heart.”</p><p>“Talk about cliché,” Dean said from the doorway.</p><p>The crone’s dark pupils swept over Dean.</p><p>“You’re next. But first I’m going to take his liver,” she cackled.</p><p>She shot her arm down Sam’s throat. His eyes bugged out, and he fought against her with his one free arm.</p><p>BLAM! The bullet blew apart the crone’s head. Her body slumped over. Sam gagged and threw the body off him. He rubbed his tongue with his hand, trying to get the taste of the old woman’s disgusting limb out of his mouth.</p><p>“Yum. Croney,” Dean said.</p><p>He took one look at Nick Warner and his smile vanished.</p><p>“Let’s get this poor guy to the hospital. He’s lost a lot of blood.”</p><p>“I almost lost a liver. I can still feel her fingers touching my stomach lining,” Sam said with a grimace. “So, I guess Nick wasn’t to blame.”</p><p>“Nope, guess not,” Dean said, untying the poor man from the bed. He then hoisted him onto his shoulder. “Come on, let’s get going.”</p><p>Later that night, as Dean and Sam drove out of the small North Dakota town, they both enjoyed a moment of quiet contemplation. The feeling that they were doing good in the world.</p><p>Dean woke from his reverie.</p><p>“You seem far away.” Lisa leaned back in her lawn chair and regarded Dean.</p><p>It was a very warm day, summer was in full swing and Ben was out riding his bike with friends. Dean had been staring into space silently for a good twenty minutes without speaking. His mind <span class="italic">was</span> far away, in a different dimension entirely, he was thinking about breaking Sam out of the cage. The terrible dreams about Sam had stopped, but Dean’s obsession with springing Sam had not.</p><p>“What’s going on in there?” Lisa tapped Dean’s head with her index finger.</p><p>Dean dusted away the cobwebs.</p><p>“I’m good. I’m good. Don’t I look good?”</p><p>“Yes. I was just wondering what you were thinking,” Lisa said, then held up her hand in defense. “I know it’s one of the cardinal sins of relationships to ask a guy what he’s thinking. But I figure I have a kid, I’m way past stuff like that.”</p><p>“I’m thinking...” Dean in fact knew he couldn’t tell Lisa what he was thinking. <span class="italic">The</span> Necronomicon, he thought. <span class="italic">I’m thinking about how I’m going to find a powerful ancient book, steal it, and then use it to bounce my brother</span>—<span class="italic">who is probably already ripped to shreds</span>—<span class="italic">out of Hell. I know I said I would stop obsessing about Sam. But I just can’t help but think this book could get me my brother back.</span></p><p><span class="italic">Now of course finding a copy will prove difficult, there might not even be one in the United States. Even if I do get my hands on it, I’ll have other problems, like figuring out how to get Lucifer out of my brother’s body. I’m hoping the binding spell in the</span> Necronomicon <span class="italic">will help me cast Lucifer back, just not in Sam’s body.</span></p><p><span class="italic">To top it all off, thinking I need to find a powerful person, most likely a witch, to help me with the whole thing. So basically I’m thinking about doing the impossible</span>—<span class="italic">getting Sam out of Hell.</span></p><p>Dean knew he couldn’t say all that to Lisa. So he said the thing that every woman likes to hear.</p><p>“Let’s go on vacation.”</p><p>Lisa sat up to face him. “Really? Dean, that would be so wonderful. Ben would love that. The last vacation Ben and I had was when he was six. We went to a water park in Michigan and I got the flu and couldn’t take him on any of the rides. A vacation would be perfect.” She leaned over and kissed Dean on the mouth.</p><p>“Wow, if I’d known I’d get that reaction I would have mentioned it weeks ago.”</p><p>“Where are we going to go?” Lisa asked.</p><p><span class="italic">Where would we go?</span> Dean thought about it. He responded with an answer that was impossible to disagree with.</p><p>“It’s a surprise, been planning it for a while. I’ll let you know.”</p><p>“Dean, that’s great. Ben is going to flip.”</p><p>Lisa was happy. Mentioning a vacation was a symbol that Dean was finally moving on from his past; putting away the crazy life that he had led for twenty-five years. Normal people take vacations. A vacation would mean Dean had finally joined the ranks of the normal and he’d retired from hunting monsters and killing things.</p><p>Of course, Lisa would never tell Dean how she felt about his old life, in fact she had always told him to do what he wanted. She didn’t want to mold Dean. He was unmoldable. But if Dean made changes himself she was more than happy to accept them.</p><p>Dean smiled. A vacation would be nice. But even as he thought about where they should go—Disneyland, Yellowstone, New York—there was something that unnerved him. For the past few months Dean had been in self-imposed exile. Even though he had begun to play suburban Ken—he had begun working, his life with Lisa and Ben was happy and fulfilled, and the memory of Sam had become less like a gnawing and more like an slight stitch that panged his soul—Dean still felt guilty about truly enjoying himself. And the idea that the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> could possibly liberate Sam from Hell was tantalizing.</p><p>“Salem?” Lisa peered at Dean over breakfast.</p><p>“Sure, I mean, look. They have the beach, restaurants, and old clipper ships. It will be educational. Ben will love it. Really.” Dean pushed the AAA brochure over to Lisa.</p><p>She stared at it skeptically.</p><p>“It’s not a vacation destination though. Is it?”</p><p>“Of course it is, look at all the tourists in this picture!” Dean beamed.</p><p>Lisa looked at Dean’s satisfied face. She couldn’t really argue about it, any vacation would be nice.</p><p>“Okay. Salem it is.”</p><p>“Ten AM. Everyone ready. “ Dean took the last swig of his coffee.</p><p>“Really?” Lisa asked. “You want to leave now?”</p><p>“Sure, why not? What are we waiting for?” Dean wanted to be heading east as soon as possible. He could have driven the fifteen-hour car ride in one sitting, but he knew that Lisa would balk at that. They would probably stop halfway through New York State. After that it would be an easy five-or six-hour drive.</p><p>Thinking about it the night before, Dean had realized that to find a witch he was going to have to go somewhere legendary—Europe was out of the question, but the next best place was Salem. That town had to be teeming with witches. He could have a nice family vacation with Lisa and Ben and also find a witch that could help him raise Sam from the dead.</p><p>Lore said that a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> had been burned during the Salem witch trials in 1692. Chances were that someone in that town still had one. Dean reasoned if he could find the book, he’d find the witch. But he would have to be prepared.</p><p>“I’m going to go out and pick up a couple of things,” Dean yelled, grabbing the keys to his truck. “I’ll be back in a half-hour. Be ready.”</p><p>Dean knew he had to have plenty of protection once he was in Salem; a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> wasn’t something to fool around with, and the person who would be powerful enough to use it wouldn’t be either. He decided to stop off at the local garden store; there was no better place to find mandrake, hemlock or monkshood. Not only were these things essential for making hex bags and protection spells, they all made excellent perennial ground cover.</p><p>After shopping, Dean sat in his truck outside the garden store. He snipped off the plants’ tops and threw the pots of soil out his truck window, drawing stares from the store employees. Feeling guilty, he got out of the truck and took the pots back inside to be recycled. <span class="italic">Wow,</span> he thought, <span class="italic">I</span> am <span class="italic">a suburban douche-dweller.</span></p><p>Back at home Dean took the cut plants and some of the weapons he kept in the trunk of the Impala, and packed them into his duffle.</p><p>Dean didn’t touch the Impala anymore. He had shoved it into the garage and covered it with a tarp. It was best he not be reminded of all the time he and Sam had spent in it.</p><p>Instead he climbed into the driver’s seat of Lisa’s CRV. Ben hopped into the back seat. As long as Ben had his videogame player he was happy. Lisa took her seat beside Dean.</p><p>“Family vacation, huh?” Lisa said.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m so Chevy Chase right now. Holiddaayy Roooaad,” Dean sung at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“Okay Sparky, let’s go.”</p><p>Dean gunned the engine. Pulling out of the driveway he admired Lisa’s little house; he was hoping that the next time he saw it he would have his brother with him. Maybe they both could stop hunting once and for all, together.</p><h2><span id="chapter-five">CHAPTER FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The Indiana clouds hung low like charcoal smudges wiped against a newsprint-colored sky, threatening rain.</p><p>Sam looked southward. He was twenty miles away from Dean. It would be a short drive—thirty minutes at the very most. Sam could make an excuse, slip away from Samuel and be there at Dean’s front door. He’d embrace him. Sam would tell him he was back, he didn’t know how it had happened, but he was back.</p><p>Sam looked in the direction of Cicero; Dean was there with Lisa. Of course, he knew he should make every effort to see Dean. But strangely he didn’t really want to. Sam wondered what he was feeling: Was it comfort that Dean was safe and finally happy? Was it happiness that he was alive and brought back from the dead? Sam had said “yes” to Lucifer and on that field he fought with every fiber of his being to gain enough control of his own body in order to throw himself into the pit. It seemed that was the last time he felt... anything.</p><p>* * *</p><p>“You coming, Sam?”</p><p>Samuel Campbell leaned out of the door of his truck and stared hard at his grandson. Sam always seemed so far off. He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. Or rather he didn’t want to. He hadn’t ever met the boy before. <span class="italic">Maybe that’s how he always was.</span> Though Samuel couldn’t quite convince himself of that. It was strange how he had found him in the first place, but despite the strange situation and the strange grandson, Sam was family.</p><p>Samuel sighed, the reality of this weird existence hitting him again. Most days he hated waking up. He didn’t think it was a miracle that had brought him back from the dead; there was too paralyzing an ache inside him for this to be a true blessing.</p><p>What bothered Samuel was walking the Earth with the knowledge that his daughter, Mary, was dead. The regret and the loss stung him every day. All he wanted was to see his daughter, her radiant face ringed with blonde hair. She always looked like a cherub to him. He didn’t have the chance to see her grow past the age of twenty-one.</p><p>It’s said that it’s awful for a child to die before a parent, but Samuel thought it was more terrible to come back to life and be told of your child’s death. And to know that she was killed by the same demon that had killed him was even worse. What he would give to go back to 1974 and murder Yellow Eyes! Samuel knew that he should be overjoyed that he could spend time with his grandson. In any regular person’s life dying ten years before your grandchildren are born ordinarily precludes being able to spend time with them—but not if you’re a Campbell.</p><p>“I’m coming!” Sam swung around and got into his grandfather’s truck.</p><p>“Why you dilly-dallying?” Samuel cast Sam a sidewards glance, trying once again to see what was behind that blank stare, but as usual it betrayed nothing. He just had to hope he was getting through to the kid. Much depended on Sam being at his side.</p><p>“You can’t see him, you know that right? It would be dangerous.”</p><p>Sam nodded. “I just wonder how he’s doing.”</p><p>“He’s doing <span class="italic">fine</span>,” Samuel said. They had been over this a half-dozen times since he had met up with his grandson. Dean was happy and the most important thing for Sam to do was to keep hunting. Sam would be putting Dean and his girl’s kid in danger if he contacted them. True or not, that’s what Samuel repeated to him and most of the time it seemed to work.</p><p>Samuel shook his head. Talking to his grandson he sometimes felt as though he was trying to get through to a block of wood. Sam was distant. But it was his inability to be <span class="italic">warm</span> that worried Samuel. He wondered what he had gotten himself into.</p><p>At other times, however, Samuel was outright floored by Sam’s facility for hunting. He had never seen anything like it. In the past couple of months hunting with Sam had proved to be a marvel. Killing werewolves, vampires, and wendigos, even ghost hunting was almost easy with Sam. He intuited the prey’s next move and was there in an instant; the capture or the kill was vicious but surgical. It was as if Sam’s deftness at killing was drawn from some lifeblood deep within him. It almost bordered on the uncanny.</p><p>It was for this reason that Sam had become a leader of sorts to his cousins: Christian, Mark, and Gwen. They were second and third cousins to Sam and a tough trio, an extension of the more scrappy side of the Campbell family tree, and it was no small feat to impress them. But Sam had earned their respect.</p><p>Samuel was impressed with Sam; if pressed he might admit that he was also a little scared of him. But the sheer number of monsters Sam was able to take down required Samuel to look past that. He needed Sam.</p><p>Samuel and Sam headed back toward the compound and pulled into the gated driveway just before dusk. The compound was a collection of industrial and agricultural buildings, strongly fortified with cement and rebar. A good place to take a stand against monsters. It served as an unofficial hunting headquarters for the Campbell family. When Samuel came back from the dead, he took up heading the family and had been sleeping there ever since.</p><p>It turned out he had to stay close to base because things had changed from the days when he was a hunter. There were more monsters than ever before. The needle had been pinging up in the red zone for months. They were on monster overload. Perhaps it was just lucky happenstance, as this was all good news to him. Samuel wanted to hunt as much as possible; he had made a deal that depended on it.</p><h2><span id="chapter-six">CHAPTER SIX</span><a href="#chapter-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Jez, this place is a dump. Though, I <span class="italic">do</span> know a lovely designer who could do wonders with the sparseness of the space. Maybe an Eames lounger or two?”</p><p>Samuel spun around and found himself face to face with Crowley. Crowley was a dandified turd in Samuel’s book, a despicable thing that blighted the earth. Even when Crowley was human, he had to have been an ass.</p><p>But Samuel needed him. He had been playing the demon’s games since he got back and his patience was starting to wear as thin as a crick, but he had to keep going. There was a light at the end of this tunnel—a big light. If Samuel helped Crowley amass a fortune of monster souls, Crowley would bring back Mary.</p><p>“What the hell do you want?” Samuel sneered.</p><p>“I just dropped in for a jelly roll and some of that delicious coffee with powdered milk you have out there.” Crowley motioned to the main space next to Samuel’s office. “No fussing about the nibblets though.” The demon dusted off a chair with his handkerchief. “You and I have some business to attend to.”</p><p>“I think you and I have said all we need to say to one another,” Samuel grunted as he eyed a salt-filled shotgun that was within arm’s reach. How he would love to stick it into Crowley’s mouth and pull the trigger.</p><p>“Don’t even think of blowing me away old man. Then where would you be?” Crowley cackled. Then, as though with the flick of a switch, he turned serious. “You need to have a talk with Dean. You remember him right? Your <span class="italic">other</span> grandson? The one with an actual... heartbeat? I know, I know. Dean’s just a regular old human so you might not have any use for him. But I need you to talk to him.”</p><p>“You know I can’t do that. There is no way I can do that,” Samuel said firmly.</p><p><span class="italic">“How</span> you do it is not my problem. Just that you <span class="italic">do</span> it. Dean has a funny little idea in his head and you have to make sure he doesn’t go through with it.” Crowley crossed and uncrossed his legs as he spoke.</p><p>“How do you know?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“You don’t need to know that. Only that I do. He thinks he’s going to be able to raise Sam from the dead using a pisser of an old text.”</p><p>Samuel realized immediately what Crowley was getting at.</p><p>“The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span>?” he exclaimed. It hadn’t occurred to Samuel before but now that he thought about it, that book <span class="italic">could</span> cause them some trouble. In the wrong hands, the wrong spell would raise Lucifer. <span class="italic">Those boys would do just about</span> <span class="italic">anything for one another,</span> thought Samuel. <span class="italic">I guess that does run in the family.</span></p><p>Crowley’s voice cut through his thoughts.</p><p>“Look here, mate, you and I are wearing the same jersey, yes? So just make sure that Deany-boy doesn’t get his hands on that one tiny little spell. Because let me tell you, that would be a crapstorm of epic proportions. There is a chance that spell, with enough battery power behind it, could actually raise Lucifer in whatever state he’s in. If that old boy gets loose again... Well then, all bets are off between you and me. Understand?”</p><p>“How am I going to stop him? I can’t control what he does.”</p><p>“No, but you can control who he has access too. So make sure he doesn’t get his hands on that book.” Crowley stood. “I’m a little grumpy that I have to keep repeating meself,” he added, moving so he standing nose to nose with Samuel. “Just do what I tell you to do. Okay?”</p><p>The demon’s cold breath stung Samuel’s face.</p><p>“Fine,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Well, good. I’m just chuffed to bits.” Crowley stepped back, all light and breezy again. “This went well. As always, I enjoy your company Samuel. It’s nice to have another old fella about.”</p><p>If Samuel had been up on the latest ways to tell Crowley where to stick it he would have, but since he wasn’t, he stayed silent. Crowley smiled, and in an instant he was gone.</p><p>Samuel plopped down into a chair. He hated that guy, almost as much as he hated Yellow Eyes.</p><p>“Oops, one more thing!” Crowley suddenly reappeared, so close Samuel couldn’t even stand up. The demon leaned over him while tapping on the crystal of his watch. “Dean is taking the fam’ on a little vacay to Salem, Massachusetts. You understand the implications?” Crowley cocked his head questioningly.</p><p>“I have to follow him,” Samuel said solemnly.</p><p>“Smart man. No wonder you’re the patriarch of this cursed and screwed clan.” Crowley patted Samuel on the cheek with his palm. “You’re taking a road trip. Chafed ass, corn nuts, having to hold your pee for fifty miles. Such fun. Get your fanny-pack.” And with that the demon disappeared again.</p><p>“Damn it.” Samuel pinched his brow. Then he called out, “Sam! Sam!”</p><p>A few moments later, his grandson opened up the steel door of Samuel’s office. His bulk almost filled the entire seven-foot doorframe.</p><p>“Yeah?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have to go. Reconnaissance mission,” Samuel said, hefting himself out of the chair and toward the wall that served as his mini-armory.</p><p>“For what?” Sam asked.</p><p>“We have to follow Dean,” Samuel said.</p><p>“What? Why?”</p><p>“Because he’s...” Samuel trailed off. He didn’t know if he should tell Sam that Dean was trying to resurrect him. Would that cause Sam undue pain to see his brother manically searching for a way to bring him back from the dead? Samuel wasn’t sure. Sam was so cold and calculating, it was hard to know how he would react. But reconnaissance wasn’t a good enough carrot on a string for Sam, he had to pique the boy’s hunting instincts.</p><p>“Witches,” Samuel said firmly. “We have to find some witches.”</p><p>“What does that have to do with Dean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“He’s after them too, and we need to get there first.”</p><p>“What are they doing? I mean, they’re kind of small fry compared to the monsters we’ve been hunting.”</p><p>“They’re trying to create monsters. Just trust me. We could pull in the motherload with this one.” Samuel was peeved he needed to give any explanation at all. “Go tell the others they’re on their own for a few days—and you and I are going to need the van.”</p><p>Sam shrugged and left the room. It was hunting—that was all that mattered to him.</p><p>Outside he stared out across the fields that surrounded the camp. He wondered why he felt disconnected from the thought of following his brother. Was it for the same reason that, though there was a breeze, he couldn’t feel it on his face? Did it have to do with the fact that he hadn’t slept since he got back? And though he had been eating, as sort of a facade so he wouldn’t freak the others out, he hadn’t been hungry. Not even once. Did it have to do with that?</p><p>And that other feeling Sam remembered having—when he and Dean would come out alive after a particularly nasty battle, or the first time he saw Dean after his brother had been pulled out of Hell—what was that feeling? Because Sam didn’t have that feeling anymore. Not about anything.</p><h2><span id="chapter-seven">CHAPTER SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The only thing Sam <span class="italic">did</span> feel was the intense need to hunt. It was almost as if an animal within him had woken up. He could literally <span class="italic">feel</span> the move a monster was about to make, and be there before it was. Sam was singular in his drive. Hunt. It was as if he no longer needed to intellectualize the right and wrong of it. All he cared about was getting the monster. For this reason Sam really was Samuel’s perfect weapon. Except Sam’s new nature wasn’t without its dangers.</p><p>Three weeks ago he and Samuel had been hunting down a monster that had taken up residence in a halfway house full of recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. The local paper had covered a murder-suicide and another unexplained death at the house. Police thought the deaths were due to the unsavory characters of the residents, most of whom had been in and out of jail or had some type of police record, but Sam knew better. He talked his grandfather into going with him to investigate.</p><p>The next morning they arrived at the door of the facility posing as priests.</p><p>“May I help you?” A short-haired, round woman answered the door.</p><p>“Bless you, child. I’m Father Tipton,” Sam introduced himself, “and this is Father Halford. We’re with the Cumberland County Prayer Outreach Center. We were hoping to come and help your residents in their time of need. Two deaths in three weeks. Terrible.”</p><p>The woman assented with a pudgy-cheeked smile. She introduced herself as Beverley and led them into a meeting room, where they talked her into letting them take a look around the house.</p><p>Seeing that each room was outfitted with a floor grate, their first thought was that the monster had been moving from room to room through the heating system. But the grates were wrought iron. Since ghosts can’t pass through iron and demons don’t like to either, they were confused. What was it? There was no way to be sure. Sam proposed they act as bait.</p><p>With a little persuasion, they were allowed to stay the night.</p><p>“I’ll stay up. You go to bed,” Sam said to his grandfather. He and Samuel had been given a room to share in the halfway house.</p><p>“Naw, I’m fine,” Samuel said, though Sam could see he looked tired.</p><p>“Okay, just saying. I don’t need much sleep.”</p><p>“Right. Maybe I’ll just shut my eyes,” Samuel said, relenting. He lay back on the bed and moments later his breathing slowed and he began to snore gently.</p><p>Sam held his salt-packed shotgun in his lap and stared into space, waiting.</p><p>Then he heard it. A deep moan from the bowels of the house, as if someone was trapped within the walls, trying to get out.</p><p>Without waking his grandfather, Sam crept out into the hallway. The residents’ rooms were all located off the upstairs corridor.</p><p>A door slammed. Sam whipped around, but didn’t move an inch further. He listened again, and heard the same moaning noise. Sam peered into the gloom at the end of the hallway. A grey mass appeared out of nowhere and gradually took shape in the dirty dark.</p><p>Sam trained his shotgun on the specter, but in a blink it was gone.</p><p>Sam ran down the corridor to the spot where the thing had been. There was no heating grate, no nothing—nowhere for it to go. Above him a single bulb flickered. He moved to touch it, but the bulb suddenly got brighter and brighter until it popped.</p><p>The thin shards of glass broke in Sam’s face. He calmly picked them out of his skin with his fingernail.</p><p>Down the hallway underneath a door, Sam saw a light. He moved toward it and kicked open the door. A girl, about his age, stared at him, her mouth open in a silent scream.</p><p>Without hesitation, Sam spun around and aimed his gun at the ceiling above him.</p><p>BLAM!</p><p>The shot missed the creature as it dropped on top of Sam.</p><p><span class="italic">A shtriga,</span> he realized. Sam struggled but the shtriga stuck its putrid face into his, and started to suck. It pulled, its beetle-black eyes rolling into its head. But there was something wrong, nothing was happening, no soul was being sucked out of Sam.</p><p>Sam smiled and with his right arm aimed the gun at the monster’s head. The shtriga avoided the shot and skidded up the wall, still facing its unbeatable prey. Sam aimed again but it was gone.</p><p>The girl on the bed finally let out a nails-on-a-chalk-board scream.</p><p>“Shut up,” Sam barked.</p><p>She did, cowering back away from Sam. Sam opened the bedroom door, but despite the screams and gunshots, the house was silent. He flicked the light switch.</p><p>“Don’t do that. It might come back! What if it—“ the girl squealed.</p><p>“What did I say?” Sam spat. She shut up again.</p><p>Sam closed his eyes. There were twenty people in the house. It was the perfect place for a shtriga to feed—beaten-down people who had given up on life. Easy prey. Like the shtrigas’ taste for children.</p><p>Sam crept back into the room where Samuel still slept; somehow the noise further down the corridor had failed to wake him.</p><p>Sam quickly loaded a couple of iron bullets into his gun—the only thing guaranteed to work on a shtriga. Then he turned out the light and leaned over his grandfather.</p><p>Sam knew the monster would be attracted to a body that wouldn’t put up too much of a fight. He took a pillow from underneath his grandfather’s head. He held it over Samuel’s face and lightly pushed down. He needed to slow Samuel’s breathing enough so that the shtriga would be drawn to his body, on the brink of dying. Samuel’s eyes popped open. He struggled against Sam, but his strength was no match for his grandson’s and in moments Samuel was unconscious.</p><p>Sam released the pillow and checked Samuel’s pulse—it was weakened, but still there. He was fine. Sam then got down on his hands and knees and shimmied underneath the bed.</p><p>A few seconds later, the lamp on the nightstand started to flicker and the air filled with a heavy weight. From his position, Sam could only see a foot of space between the floor and the underbelly of the bed.</p><p>Slowly, the dripping grey matter of the shtriga appeared, fluttering a couple of inches above the floor. It was singularly focused on the unconscious old man lying on the mattress above.</p><p>Sam heard the shtriga’s large mouth open, followed by a hollow sucking. Samuel gurgled. The life was slowly being drained from him. Sam silently pushed his way to the opposite side of the bed, and pulled himself into a crouch. With his finger poised on the trigger, he sprang up from the floor and fired.</p><p>The shtriga emitted a high-pitched, inhuman scream as the iron bullet exploded through the top of its head. Dusty rag-like pieces stuck to the wall behind it. The body fell on top of Samuel.</p><p>“Ahhhhh!” Samuel coughed as he sat up. “What the hell did you do?”</p><p>“Used you as bait. Had to,” Sam replied.</p><p>He stood up and threw the monster’s body off Samuel’s legs.</p><p>“You what?”</p><p>“I used you as bait. Had to slow down your heart rate to make you weaker, so it would be attracted to you.” Sam put the shotgun away.</p><p>“Not only did you kill the damn thing, but you almost killed me in the process!” Samuel spluttered, glaring at his grandson.</p><p>“I just wanted to kill it. I knew it would go after you. You weren’t in any danger.”</p><p>“Fathers?” Beverly stood in curlers and a bathrobe at the doorway to the room.</p><p>Sam shoved past her.</p><p>“All set here. The souls of your residents are all saved.”</p><p>“But what is that?” Beverly asked, pointing at the splattered body of the shtriga.</p><p>“Dead cat,” Samuel said, flashing her a cursory smile. “Sorry about that. The church will cover the clean-up costs. Thanks for letting us stay.”</p><p>Samuel moved past her and followed Sam out the door.</p><p>Sam thought about how many miles he had traveled with Dean. Thousands, millions. He didn’t know. He didn’t care. All Sam wanted was to get to Salem and take out as many witches as Samuel told him to.</p><p>It made perfect sense to him that witches would be creating monsters. It seemed like there were a lot more of them around these days. Old Sam would have wanted to know why there were more monsters. New Sam just liked hunting them. Old Sam wouldn’t have almost killed his grandfather to gank a monster. New Sam, it didn’t faze him much. According to his grandfather, he had messed up. He moved on. He didn’t feel guilty about it like old Sam would have.</p><p>Sam did remember having that feeling, guilt. A sick aching in his stomach, a flutter in his heart that would make him tremble and go weak. Guilt was an awful feeling, and being with Dean those past couple of years he had felt it <span class="italic">constantly.</span> Now, Sam didn’t have that feeling any longer. He was free. Free to run after something, kill it and then move on. He was no longer tied to the push and pull of his mind and heart, weighing whether what he was doing was right or wrong. Instinct was the only feeling that was driving him.</p><p>THRUMP. THRUMP. THRUMP. Sam drove the van as his grandfather slept in the back. The road stretched out before him. Truth be told, he liked being without his brother. Hunting. Sam only wanted to hunt.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eight">CHAPTER EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>As Sam drove, he thought back to three months before.</p><p>He lay on the cold grassy ground looking up at the gray sky above him. A cold sensation was shooting from his back around his spine, and invading him through his blood. He was dizzy, as if someone was pushing him on one of those spinning carousels in a playground. His entire body hummed like a thousand tuning forks were being held to his bones. He tried to move his fingers, but wasn’t sure if he was able.</p><p>Thirty minutes went by before he could roll off his back and sit up. All around him the grass was scorched black and flattened by the epic fight between the two powerful angels. Everything was super bright, his eyes burned.</p><p>A car drove past on the nearest road, the sound startling him. He realized his ears were still ringing. He had no clue how long he had been gone. Or how he’d got out.</p><p>He pulled his shirt off his shoulder—but there wasn’t a hand-mark on him like Dean had had when he was brought back by Castiel. He didn’t have a bruise or a scratch on him. How had this happened? The last thing he remembered was jumping into the pit, and then a soul-searing pain. That was it.</p><p>He stumbled out of Stull Cemetery disoriented and alone. He headed north and hit Route 70. A big rig had picked him up and offered him a ride down the road to Topeka. Once in Topeka he had realized he wanted to check on one thing.</p><p>Sam caught the date on a flat-screen TV in a coffee shop and realized he hadn’t been gone for very long at all.</p><p>Though not much time had passed, there was a profound difference in the way Sam felt. Namely—great. He felt like his legs had a strange sense of purpose, like they were more self-assured. He held his body differently, he felt stronger, broader, more vital. Yes, there was definitely a difference in Sam.</p><p>He quickly realized the potential of his situation; he could be anyone, do anything. No one was waiting for him any longer; there was no one to tell him he was messing everything up—again. No one to tell him that he couldn’t do something or that he wasn’t living up to what was expected of him.</p><p>Like Dean.</p><p>For the first time in a long time, Sam felt free. But he needed to check and make sure. For that reason, he went to Lisa Braeden’s house and confirmed that Dean had shown up. He saw Dean, glass of Scotch in hand, sitting at the dinner table and Sam knew this was how it should be. Dean should be in there, and he should be outside. In the world. A new person.</p><p>It took him two days to get new credit cards and pick up a new Dodge Charger courtesy of some falsified loan documents. Sam didn’t want to go to any of their old haunts so he found a different black market, a small brick warehouse on the south side of Chicago, where he purchased a couple of unregistered guns. Sam knew what he had been brought back for. He was here to hunt. There was an ache inside him and he knew exactly what food to feed it: pure, unadulterated hate.</p><p>Sam holed up in a crappy motel with a new computer, he guessed Dean had kept his old one, and started combing the local news.</p><p>He stayed up all night, meticulously looking at each picayune site. And then he found an interesting little titbit. A whole spate of cow mutilations in a small town in North Dakota. Every animal was found drained of blood, the throat ripped out, but there weren’t any signs of tire tracks or animal prints. Could be a werewolf, or something cryptozoological. Whatever, it was a case.</p><p>Sam started his investigation by examining the dozens of comments on the news site. Just about all of them complained that the new sheriff, Sheriff Littlefoot, wasn’t doing anything to help the local ranchers. They blamed his inaction on him being an out-of-towner who didn’t understand the town’s need for answers.</p><p>Sam roared into town in his Charger, sussed out which ranchers had been victimized and swiftly interviewed them. Not that it told him much. The hard-working, hard-living ranchers were fed up with guys in offices not doing anything for them. They needed answers.</p><p>Posing as a park ranger, Sam rented a four-wheeler and went out to the site of the mutilations. The sky was big and the plains were wide. Even as he stood knee-deep in cow intestines, for the first time in a long time Sam felt he was <span class="italic">enjoying</span> his life.</p><p>That night Sam kept vigil on a barstool in the local saloon. He had been eyeing the cute waitress in the jean-skirt all night. She had given him a couple of glances, but nothing that told him she was interested. That was, until closing time rolled around.</p><p>Sam had downed what he thought was a good amount of beer, but he was as lucid and sober as he’d ever been. Her name was Jodi, and Sam chatted with her as she closed out her night and counted her cash tips. They shared another drink and then Sam invited her back to his motel room.</p><p>Sam was amazed. It was usually Dean who bagged the chicks. Sam had never had much of a taste for it. But something had changed. He enjoyed himself. In fact, it was the best sex of his life. And he didn’t understand why. The girl was cute, but by no means would you stop the car to look at her. She had a good body, but it wasn’t like she was a keeper. Sam couldn’t understand what had changed, until he realized that emotionally—he felt nothing.</p><p>He didn’t feel bad about leading her on and telling her that he had a new job in town and was looking to settle down with the “right girl.” He didn’t feel bad when he lied and said, yeah, he thought she was beautiful. He didn’t feel anything but pure physical pleasure. No guilt. Usually, if he had sex with a girl, he would immediately think of Jessica and the moment would be ruined. But now: nothing. No guilt. It was the most free he had ever felt in his life.</p><p>But more pressing things demanded his attention. He was pretty sure there was a werewolf in town somewhere. The question was—where?</p><p>The next morning he decided to visit the infamous Sheriff Littlefoot, posing as a fed this time, so as to outrank him. Sam walked into the sheriff’s dimly lit office. The metal blinds were cinched shut and made it difficult to see. The sheriff was a tall man of Native American descent. He was handsome but had grown paunchy around the middle.</p><p>“Mind if I open these up?” Sam said, moving toward the windows.</p><p>“Actually, I do. Sorry, stigmatism in my eye. Doctor says it’s best to keep the light low.”</p><p>“I’ve never heard that before,” Sam said as he made himself comfortable and let the Sheriff sweat a bit.</p><p>The Sheriff ran through the usual nervous questions and answers a small-town law officer asks when a federal agent is in their jurisdiction. “What was this about?” “These things happen all the time in ranching areas, it’s just wild animals.” “I’ve seen this a million times before and it’s usually over-active imaginations.”</p><p>Sam listened, then asked to look at the files and if the Sheriff would mind if he stopped by at his house to drop them off later.</p><p>The sheriff resisted, saying, “Me, my wife, and the boy might be having dinner.”</p><p>Sam assured him that he wouldn’t interfere, he just wanted to get the files back in the sheriff’s hands as soon as possible.</p><p>That afternoon, Sam sat outside the sheriff’s house until the evening. It was a nice neighborhood; kids played in the streets, mothers pushed baby carriages. Sam registered this and continued to gaze intently at the sheriff’s house. But the small clapboard house was silent all afternoon, the curtains drawn tight.</p><p>About seven in the evening, when the sun had gone down, and the prairies surrounding the town gave off a silver sheen, the lights inside the house clicked on, and the sheriff’s little boy came out to play for the first time all day.</p><p>Shortly thereafter the sheriff came home. Sam slid low in his seat. The sheriff gathered up his son and went inside.</p><p>Sam took out one of his new guns and made sure it was loaded with a silver bullet and then approached the house. As he got closer a sickening baying came from inside. Sam tried to peek through the window but the curtains were still drawn. He needed to find another way in.</p><p>On other side of the house, Sam pushed open the small bathroom window. Through the open doorway and down a hallway he could make out the faint outline of a regular living room, complete with a small TV and worn couches.</p><p>Sam silently hoisted himself in through the window and crept across the room. Across the hallway there was another, smaller parlor and behind that the kitchen. The baying stopped. Sam thought he could hear the slick, wet sound of teeth pulling flesh apart.</p><p>Pressed against the wall, he edged down the corridor until he was on the other side of the kitchen door. Sam knew he was going to have to act quickly.</p><p>Just as he was about to kick the door open, the sound of breaking glass crackled from somewhere in the house.</p><p>A chair scraped—someone was getting up in the kitchen to investigate the sound. Sam needed a way out.</p><p>He ran up the stairs, and pushed open the first door he came to. He hid in what looked like the kid’s bedroom. He waited a short while, then crept back down the stairs. Outside the kitchen door he drew in his breath, readied his gun then—</p><p>“This is my hunt, boy,” a voice whispered.</p><h2><span id="chapter-nine">CHAPTER NINE</span><a href="#chapter-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam spun around and came face to face with a man who looked very much like his grandfather. Sam had only seen Samuel in pictures, but the resemblance was unmistakable—though in the earlier photos Samuel had a lot more hair.</p><p>Sam’s face fell. He looked at the kitchen doorway on the other side of which he assumed there was a family of very hungry werewolves, then back at his long-dead grandfather.</p><p>Samuel leaned in and whispered in Sam’s ear, “Hope that’s not a silver bullet in there. The little one is a Native American god—you’ll need something else to kill it.”</p><p>Sam looked at his grandfather and then inclining his head to indicate the other man should follow him, he silently slipped out the front door.</p><p>Once outside, he checked to make sure his grandfather was behind and retreated a little way down the block. Then Sam turned and took a good look at the other man. No question, it <span class="italic">had</span> to be Samuel Campbell. He was broad and in good shape, and most definitely alive. But it soon became clear that Samuel had no idea who Sam was.</p><p>“Why you edging onto my hunt?” Samuel demanded. “Who sent you? Did Mark and Gwen think I couldn’t handle this myself? Jesus H. Christ, I’ve hunted for two lifetimes more than them, and they still coddle me like an invalid.”</p><p>“Hold on. I didn’t expect anyone else up here with me,” Sam protested.</p><p>“Well, obviously neither did I,” Samuel retorted.</p><p>“We can probably clear this up pretty quick,” Sam continued. “I’m John.”</p><p>“Well, John, nice to meet you. I’m Samuel Campbell.” Sam’s long-dead grandfather held out his hand.</p><p>Sam shook it, and smiled gainfully. He didn’t know who was pulling what but he wasn’t going to get caught in Hell again. In an instant, he raised the barrel of his sawed-off and cracked Samuel in the nose. Samuel dropped onto one knee holding his face, blood dripping onto the sidewalk. A couple out for an evening stroll quickly reversed their direction.</p><p>Sam pulled out a flask of holy water, grabbed Samuel’s chin and forced it down his throat. Samuel choked a bit, but he certainly wasn’t smoking from the inside out. The old man tried to get up but Sam kicked his legs out from underneath him. Samuel fell heavily onto the ground.</p><p>He was still trying to staunch his bloody nose when Sam grabbed him again and sliced his forearm with a silver knife. No sizzling.</p><p>“Jesus Christ! What the hell are you doing?” Samuel cried.</p><p>“You’re supposed to be dead,” Sam said, aiming his gun between Samuel’s eyes. “So you’re either an angel, a demon, or something in between. Which is it?”</p><p>“Jesus, boy. How do you know that?”</p><p>“Know what?” Sam said.</p><p>“How do you know I’m supposed to be dead?” Samuel said, pushing himself off the ground, while still trying to stop the bleeding from his nose and forearm.</p><p>Sam hesitated.</p><p>“Because you’re my grandfather,” he said eventually.</p><p>Samuel looked into Sam’s eyes. “Sam?”</p><p>“Dean told you about me?”</p><p>“Dean told me <span class="italic">all</span> about you; Stanford, your girlfriend, what a great hunter you are.”</p><p>“Dean said that?” Sam asked, truly skeptical that his brother would have complimented him.</p><p>“He said that you have a good head on your shoulders. You’re fast, but mostly people trust you. Kind face, I guess. You’re the brains, the yin to Dean’s yang.”</p><p><span class="italic">That’s one way to put it,</span> Sam thought. “Yeah, well, he never told me that.”</p><p>“Where is he anyway?” Samuel asked. “I thought you guys were a team.”</p><p>“Yeah, um, not anymore. Dean decided to pack it in and settle down with his girlfriend.”</p><p>“Girlfriend? Really? Well, that’s wonderful. I would love to see him,” Samuel said. “But of course, things are a little different now. You know since... I’ve come back.”</p><p>“Yeah, how did that happened?” Sam asked. He needed to know. Two people from the same family being resurrected, one from a cage in Hell—surely it couldn’t be a coincidence.</p><p>“No idea. Woke up in a field somewhere. I called my niece—she was the only one I could think of that would be young enough to be alive—and she took me in. She was hunting. Met the group that she hunts with. Just sort of fell back into it.”</p><p>Samuel pulled Sam in for a hug.</p><p>“It’s great to meet you, son.”</p><p>Sam pushed him away. Enough of this family reunion crap, it was time to get back to business.</p><p>“So the kid is a god?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah. No need to kill the kid though, just chase the god out,” Samuel explained. “He’s the incarnation of Malsum. It’s an Algonquin Cain and Abel story. The incarnation of Malsum comes every generation, takes the form of a wolf and mostly mutilates cattle as a kind of trick.”</p><p>“So you weren’t there to kill him?”</p><p>“Not at all. It’s just killing cattle, not people. We have to chase the god out while it’s in the wolf form, not as a child.”</p><p>“Then why were you sneaking into the house?”</p><p>“I was going to hide under the bed until he changed, then use this on him.” Samuel held up an elaborate bone and herb garland. “Wrap it around his neck, say a prayer three times and it’s supposed to send Malsum back to the dark world.”</p><p>“Let’s just wait in the car then. If he moves, we’ll get him,” Sam proposed.</p><p>They sat in Sam’s car for another hour or two. Sam wasn’t in the mood for talking, but after thirty-odd years of being dead, it seemed his grandfather had plenty of questions. Sam responded as politely as he could, but he kept to himself the fact that he had been Lucifer’s chosen vessel and had taken Lucifer on and jumped into the pit.</p><p>At around ten in the evening, the Sheriff’s little boy appeared on the front doorstep. Sam and Samuel hunkered down in their seats as the Sheriff and his wife carefully peered up and down the street. They then ceremonially kissed the child on each cheek and handed him what looked like a small snack. The child turned his back on his parents and in an instant turned into a silver wolf.</p><p>“But the god is a bad god, right?” Sam whispered.</p><p>“I guess so. He’s Cain,” his grandfather replied.</p><p>“Good,” Sam said. He got out of the car with his shotgun drawn. The Sheriff looked up, saw Sam, and yelled at the wolf to run. The wolf glanced at Sam and took off across the street and over the prairie beyond.</p><p>Sam was almost as quick. He ran swiftly after the creature, leaving his grandfather far behind.</p><p>The wolf leapt over a twelve-foot-wide irrigation ditch and kept going. Sam jumped, but hit the ground a little short, sliding down the embankment. But moments later, he found his footing and raced up the hill back onto the prairie. The wolf was far ahead now, so Sam leveled his gun and shot. The silver wolf went down.</p><p>Satisfied, Sam approached his victim. The creature was breathing heavily, blood draining from the back of its leg out onto the dry ground.</p><p>“What did you do?” Samuel yelled breathlessly as he reached Sam’s side.</p><p>“Give me the wreath, you say the prayer,” Sam directed.</p><p>Samuel did as his grandson said. Sam wrapped the herbs around the wolf’s neck as Samuel said the prayer three times.</p><p>The wolf lifted its head one last time then laid it back down on the ground.</p><p>“You killed him, Sam. You killed a <span class="italic">child,”</span> Samuel said. “What is wrong with you? <span class="italic">You don’t kill people!”</span></p><p>Sam looked down impassively at the wolf then unwrapped the herbs and bones from its neck. The body of the wolf disappeared and in its place was the young black-haired boy.</p><p>Silently, Sam scooped him up. The boy’s breathing was faint. Sam strode rapidly back across the prairie to the Sheriff’s house, put the child in his father’s arms, then got into the car. His grandfather was waiting in the passenger seat. Still without speaking, Sam started the engine and sped onto the highway.</p><p>Eventually Samuel broke the silence.</p><p>“You shot a boy,” he said.</p><p>“I killed a nasty god. The boy will be fine,” Sam replied. He gripped the wheel.</p><p>“The fact that you could have killed him means nothing to you? Who taught you that?”</p><p>“No one did. I did what needed to be done,” Sam said, staring at the road.</p><p>“What happened to you, boy?”</p><p>Sam shrugged. “I was sent to Hell.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-ten">CHAPTER TEN</span><a href="#chapter-ten" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The rhythmic thrumming of the tires over the cracks in the Eisenhower-era road lulled Dean into a reverie. This stretch of sun-baked cement was like the thousands of miles Dean had logged with Sam at his side. Dean’s mind swerved again toward that afternoon at Stull Cemetery. He gripped the steering wheel tight and tried to forget. But like an unbalanced axle, he slowly got pulled to the side that his mind favored—Dean thought back to the days before Sam jumped.</p><p>“For the record, I agree with you. About... me. You think I’m too weak to take on Lucifer. Well, so do I. I know exactly how screwed-up I am. You, Bobby, Cass—I’m the least of any of you,” Sam said earnestly. They’d had this conversation multiple times and each time Dean had said, “No.” He wasn’t going to let Sam say “Yes.”</p><p>“Sam—“ Dean began, but he didn’t know how to carry on. His brother wasn’t the least of them. He’d just taken one too many turns for the worse over the last two years: he had drunk demon blood, shacked up with Ruby, let Lucifer out of the cage. Dean couldn’t deny that Sam had messed up. But who on Earth could take on Lucifer? Dean just couldn’t bear to see his brother killed.</p><p>Sam continued. “It’s true. I’m also all we got. If there was another way... But I don’t think there is. There’s just me. So I don’t know what else to do. Except just try to do what’s gotta be done.”</p><p>And then Dean had lied to Death’s face; told him he would let Sam jump.</p><p>When Dean spoke to Bobby later, he was surprised to find that Bobby agreed with Sam.</p><p>“Look, I’m not sayin’ Sam ain’t ass-full of character defects. But—“</p><p>“But what?” Dean asked curtly.</p><p>“Back at Niveus? I watched that kid pull out one civilian after another. Must have saved ten people. Never stopped, never slowed down. We’re hard on him, Dean. And we’ve always been.”</p><p>Dean knew that Bobby was right: At his core—his very core where his heart beat—Sam was a good person.</p><p>“So I gotta ask you, Dean. What are you afraid of exactly? Losing—or losing your brother?”</p><p>Lisa had become accustomed to that look in Dean’s eyes. She had deliberately overlooked the history of Salem, the witch trials and all the supernatural activity they promised, when Dean mentioned it as his planned vacation spot for them.</p><p><span class="italic">A vacation in Salem is better than no vacation at all,</span> she reasoned. <span class="italic">And a change of scenery is good. He will be okay. This will be okay.</span> She forced herself to ignore the feeling that perhaps Dean wasn’t telling her the whole story.</p><p>“New York State! Just crossed into New York, Ben. Ben, you listening?” Dean said, checking the rearview.</p><p>“Whatever.” Ben glanced up from his handheld PSP. “It looks exactly like the last state.”</p><p>“Ben,” Lisa said, giving him a motherly warning to not act out.</p><p>Ben heeded his mother’s tone.</p><p>“It’s cool. Very cool,” he said, clearly trying to sound more enthusiastic.</p><p>“Good,” Dean said with a smile. “Seven more hours and we’re there.”</p><p>“Seven more? Are you sure you’re okay to keep driving? Shall I take over for a while?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m fine. Better than fine,” Dean said. And he was. The closer they got to Salem the closer he got to finding someone to help him raise Sam. Dean was focused on one thing and one thing only—getting his brother back.</p><p>“Dean,” Lisa chided, “I know you can spend days straight in a car, but Ben and I can’t. We need to stretch our legs and it’s almost nine. Ben needs to go to bed.”</p><p>“I can sleep back here,” Ben offered.</p><p>“A proper bed. Please Dean, can we stop?”</p><p>Dean looked at Lisa. He didn’t want to stop, he wasn’t used to staggering journeys and waiting around. He just wanted to get to Salem. But he had other people to consider on this trip, it wasn’t just him and Sam, driving through the night to another hunt. He was supposed to be on vacation.</p><p>“Sure, no problem. Next town or rest stop, we’ll find a room. Okay?”</p><p>“Thanks,” Lisa said, putting her hand on Dean’s arm.</p><p>An hour later they pulled off the highway and into a little one-street town. Dean stopped the car in front of the only hotel he could see. It had a Western-style feel to it even though they were in western New York State, not Arizona.</p><p>“You check in, I’ll drive park around back,” Dean suggested.</p><p>Lisa and Ben hopped out and Dean pulled the car left, back into the street.</p><p>SCRREEECH!</p><p>Dean stomped on the breaks as a white van careened out of nowhere and past the car.</p><p>“Jesus H. Christ, Sam! You think you could maybe not hit your brother’s car while you’re still pretending to be dead,” Samuel spat.</p><p>Sam had pulled off Route 86 a couple of minutes after Dean. He hadn’t been following him the whole time, but had spotted the car halfway through Ohio. Samuel had said that they should follow Dean and keep an eye on him. If they got to Salem before him, they risked losing him or worse, being spotted.</p><p>“It’s that damn Daddy Caddy. Dean never drove like that in the Impala,” Sam said, scowling.</p><p>He held his course and pulled the van into the parking lot of a park a couple of blocks from Dean’s motel.</p><p>“Let’s get the MREs and hit the road right after them in the a.m.,” Samuel said.</p><p>Sam ate his Ready-to-Eat meal sitting on a picnic table while his grandfather sorted through their equipment in the open back of the van.</p><p>Sam looked out over a buzzing little park pond, he liked doing everything himself these days and he didn’t feel the need for company. As much as he trusted his grandfather, he trusted himself more.</p><p>Sam bit into a hard foil-wrapped brownie. It was tasteless to him, or maybe it was just tasteless. It didn’t matter. The only hint of a feeling Sam could really understand was satisfaction. He liked getting a job done. He thought about Dean only a couple of blocks away. Whatever Dean was after, if they had to get there first and do it better, that was fine by Sam.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eleven">CHAPTER ELEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-eleven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The next day Dean, Lisa, and Ben were on the road early. They stopped at a fast food drive-through for breakfast and then were on their way. Four hours later Dean finally pulled off the interstate.</p><p>“Here we are. This looks good enough,” Dean said as he angled the car into a Sunshine Inn parking lot. It was located off a bleak mall and gas station-stuffed suburban thruway.</p><p>“Oh Dean, I forgot to tell you,” Lisa said, with a slight smirk. “I made reservations at this cute bed and breakfast in the heart of town. Here’s the address.” She handed him a piece of paper printed out from the Internet. “I think if you pull out of here, take a right, and then take your next right at Waters Street, that will take us right into town.” Lisa gestured the route Dean was to take.</p><p>Dean stared hard at the piece of paper. Reservations? He’d never made reservations before. <span class="italic">For anything.</span></p><p>“What’s wrong with this place?” Dean said, even though he knew full well the rooms inside were most likely witch-themed, dirty, and smelled of old cigarettes.</p><p>“Dean, please. It’s our <span class="italic">vacation.</span> I wanted to stay somewhere nice.” Lisa turned her mouth into a little pout. She hated resorting to female trickery—but she wasn’t going to stay in a flea-bag hotel.</p><p>Dean shrugged. “How can I say no to that face?”</p><p>In the back seat Ben rolled his eyes and slumped further down.</p><p>“Gross,” he mumbled.</p><p>Dean did as he was told and followed the directions into Salem proper. The town was a nice old colonial village with tree-lined streets and lots of federal-style brick houses with flat fronts, colonnade porches, and small windows. But commercialism and chains had grown like weeds and it was clear that the town didn’t shy away from its dark past; in fact it did everything it could to capitalize on it.</p><p>They found the bed and breakfast easily enough, across the street from a big grassy expanse called Salem Common.</p><p>“Is that where they hanged the witches?” Ben asked, putting aside his video player and looking out of the window.</p><p>“No, actually they hanged the witches on a hill on the southwest side of town,” Dean replied. “A place called Gallows Hill, though they’re not sure of the exact location. Of course, none of the people they hanged actually were witches.” Dean’s voice betrayed a slight hint of having too much relish in the topic. Lisa shot him a look.</p><p>“That’s cool. Can we go see it?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Of course. Do you know anything about the Salem witch trials?” Dean asked as he parallel parked the CRV into a too-tight space.</p><p>“Not much, a little in school.”</p><p>“Well then, I have lots to show you,” Dean said.</p><p>They piled out of the car and Dean grabbed most of the bags. He wasn’t used to actual luggage, he and Sam always traveled light, one duffle bag a piece at the very most. Now Dean really did feel and look like Chevy Chase.</p><p>The inside of the inn was tastefully decorated in a display-everything-your-grandma-likes kind of way. But Lisa didn’t seem to mind.</p><p>“Hello, hello. You must be the Winchesters. I’m Ingrid,” the tall middle-aged proprietor chimed from behind the inn’s counter.</p><p>“Yes, we are. I made a reservation for two adjoining rooms,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Aww, I can stay in a room by myself,” Ben grumbled.</p><p>“Sure you can, buddy,” Dean said, looking at Lisa. Dean and Sam had stayed in hotel rooms by themselves since they were seven. Ben was twelve, he could handle that.</p><p>“No, he can’t,” Lisa said.</p><p>Ben mumbled under his breath, then crossed the foyer to sit in a high-backed chair near the door.</p><p>“Two adjoining rooms will be fine,” Lisa said, turning back to Ingrid with a smile.</p><p>“Great. Would you also like to schedule one of our ghost tours? We offer a full paranormal tour of our inn. We’re the only inn on the East Coast with our own ghosts!”</p><p>“Your own ghosts?” Dean said, eyebrow raised.</p><p>Lisa paled. “Oh Dean, I didn’t know!”</p><p>“We’re the most popular inn on the square,” Ingrid continued proudly. “People come from all over to take our spooky ghost tour and meet our otherworldly residents. There is Sally, the little girl who lost her bonnet. And Captain Chancy, who fell asleep and never woke up. He still thinks it’s 1697 and he’s sailing the high seas!”</p><p>“Great,” Dean said flatly. It was so not great.</p><p>“We can go somewhere else,” Lisa murmured quietly to Dean.</p><p>“No, it’s fine,” Dean said. The spooks sounded harmless enough—if they even existed at all.</p><p>“Real ghosts?” Ben jumped up in anticipation. “Dean, you can teach me how to kill ‘em!”</p><p>Ingrid looked at Dean questioningly.</p><p>“He means I can... um... kill ‘em with teaching him the rich history of your beautiful inn,” Dean said through clenched teeth. He shot a look at Ben. “Adjoining rooms sound great, the spookier the better,” he added with a forced grin.</p><p>“Lovely. Here are your keys.” Ingrid handed Lisa a set of keys with a clipper ship key ring hanging off them. “Go up the stairs and to your right. Your rooms are the third and fourth doors on the left, overlooking the historic Salem Common.”</p><p>“Thank you so much,” Lisa said. They picked up their bags and trudged up the wide wooden staircase to the inn’s second-floor rooms. Lisa opened the highly polished wooden door with brass numbers on it. She smiled gamely at Dean and walked into the room ahead of him.</p><p>“I think this is pretty. Don’t you?” she asked, throwing open the blue-and-yellow-flowered curtains.</p><p>Dean surveyed the large garish floral bedspread and the ruffled pillow shams. This in fact wasn’t his idea of comfortable, he felt like he was back in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in the Carrigan’s house. They had been pagan gods of the Winter Solstice, and their design aesthetic was similar to the room: like someone just vomited up a quilting bee.</p><p>Dean smiled. If this was what made Lisa happy that he would cope. Besides, he wasn’t here to relax, he wanted to get started searching for a witch as soon as possible. But Lisa had other plans.</p><p>“I’m starving, let’s go get some fried clams and French fries,” she said with a smile. “It’s a gorgeous day. I don’t want to spend a minute inside.”</p><p>What was Dean going to say? As much as he wanted to start his mission, he knew that he had to spend at least a little time with Lisa and Ben.</p><p>“Okay then,” he said.</p><p>Outside the sun was shining. As they made their way through the narrow streets, tourists crammed the brick sidewalks. Dean wondered at all the people enjoying their lives—oblivious to how much Sam and Dean had sacrificed so that they could continue on as normal. Would they even appreciate it if they knew? Dean doubted it. He didn’t get a chance to walk among the masses very often and he was pretty sure he hadn’t missed much as he watched tourists munching ice cream cones and shoving their bratty kids in front of buildings and statues to be photographed. For a moment he wondered why he even cared about saving all these schlubs’ lives. It made him itch to get Sam back all the more.</p><p>“How about here?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m starved,” Ben added.</p><p>They tramped into a fish and chip shop called “Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky.” A wooden sign hung above the doorway: a drunken-looking cartoon sailor and a clam clung to one another in what looked like mid-song.</p><p>At the back of the restaurant a creaky covered porch hung out over the water. The bay was blue and still. They placed their order and then sat down at a brown-paper-covered picnic table. To their right, a couple of old clipper ships bobbed next to an ancient blackened pier.</p><p>“Are those pirate ships?” Ben asked, looking out over the water. “I totally want to go on a pirate ship.”</p><p>Dean smiled smugly at Lisa as if to say, “I told you so.”</p><p>“Sure are. You and your mom can take a tour of them this afternoon if you want,” Dean said.</p><p>“What about you?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I thought I’d... you know, look around town and find fun things to do. Plan the rest of our trip,” Dean said casually.</p><p>Minutes later, toasty piles of fish, clams, and chips heaped in paper baskets were placed in front of them by a young girl who looked to be a little older than Ben.</p><p>“My name’s Perry. Just let me know if you need anything else,” she said with a smile directed at Ben. Ben blushed.</p><p>“Thanks,” Lisa said with an edge.</p><p>Perry bobbed a little curtsey and returned to her place behind the ordering counter, Ben’s eyes followed her.</p><p>“Don’t even think about it,” Lisa said gently as she squeezed ketchup onto a plate and dragged a fry though it. “She’s five years older than you.”</p><p>“She’s not five years older. She’s like fifteen,” Ben said.</p><p>“How do you know?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“I’m twelve, Mom. I know,” Ben retorted. “Besides, she was just being nice. You’re always saying it takes a special person to make a lot of friends. Right?”</p><p>“Kid has a point. I’ve heard you say that,” Dean said, grinning at Lisa as he teased her.</p><p>“Whose side are you on?” Lisa asked, poking Dean light-heartedly in the ribs.</p><p>Dean dug into more of the food and enjoyed the moment. He liked looking out across the water. He and Sam had never spent much time on the coast.</p><p>Ben polished off his food in minutes.</p><p>“I’m still hungry,” he declared. “Can I have five bucks to get some more?”</p><p>“Oh, now you want more clams?” Dean smiled, reaching into his pocket and handing Ben a five. “I can see why. She’s cute.”</p><p>Ben blushed again.</p><p>“Naw, I just want some more fries. What’s the big deal?”</p><p>“Just act casual. Like you haven’t even noticed that she’s good-looking,” Dean confided.</p><p>“Really?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Absolutely. Pretty girls hate when people fawn over them. Just act natural. Like you couldn’t care less about her.”</p><p>Ben nodded earnestly and went up to the counter.</p><p>“Are you teaching my son to be a player?” Lisa asked half smiling, half serious.</p><p>“Kid has to know how to flirt. I’m just teaching him the basics. We haven’t even begun the master class.”</p><p>“Master class, huh?”</p><p>Ben came back with a large smile plastered across his face.</p><p>“We’re going to the movies,” he said proudly.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t hear a question in there,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Can I go to the movies?” Ben rephrased, rolling his eyes.</p><p>“Wow, that girl sure moves fast,” Dean said, impressed.</p><p>Ben and Lisa went back and forth about whether it was a good idea for him to go to the movies in a strange town with a strange girl. Ben accused his mother of once again being overprotective.</p><p>Dean decided to sit this discussion out. Instead he watched the girl as she chatted affably with other customers. The teen kept stealing glances at him, like she was appraising something. She gave off a much more sophisticated air than a regular teenager. In that respect Lisa was right, Dean thought. But he figured Perry was a savvy, towny chick who regularly asked boys out in order to get a free movie and some popcorn. No harm in that.</p><p>They left Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky and wandered around the square before following the throngs of people down one of the touristy little street, crammed with gift shops and cafés.</p><p>“Witch museum? We gotta go there.” Ben pointed out a tall, large, stone-faced building towering above them, with a stream of people queuing out the door and around the corner.</p><p>“Looks popular. Yeah, you guys should definitely do that,” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean, I thought we were here to spend time <span class="italic">together</span>?” Lisa said quietly, out of earshot of Ben. “We didn’t come all this way so you could wander off alone.”</p><p>Dean knew she was right, and he didn’t want to upset her. But he had come to Salem to raise Sam, and he had to find a way to do that without Lisa finding out his real motive.</p><p>“Lis, I’m just saying,” Dean said gently, “I might want to go off and do a little exploring myself. Like boring stuff. You know I’m a big history buff. They have some great historical reference libraries in town. I might want to hit those.”</p><p>“You’re a big history buff?” Lisa looked at him skeptically.</p><p>“Yeah, totally. Ask me anything about the Bible—I bet I know it,” Dean countered.</p><p>“I’m not going to a library on my vacation,” Ben chimed in.</p><p>“See, what did I tell you. Kid doesn’t want to go to a library,” Dean said. “Don’t worry about it, we’re totally Brady Bunch Does Honolulu this week, except of course minus like seven people.”</p><p>“Six. Minus six people,” Lisa corrected him with a grin.</p><p>“Who’re you counting? Alice’s boyfriend didn’t go to Hawaii with them,” Dean said.</p><p>They continued to argue the specifics of the Brady Bunch Hawaii trip as they passed a quaint shop with bay windows filled to the brim with witchy tchotchkes and a whole bunch of other stuff that all looked to Dean like worthless crap.</p><p>“Let’s go in here,” Ben said, veering in through the front door.</p><p>Lisa and Dean followed him into the store.</p><p>As far as Dean could see in the gloom, they were the only customers. Other tourists must have been put off by the slightly odiferous shop with its cloister-like atmosphere and creaky floorboards.</p><p>Across the back wall of the store, large apothecary jars full of herbs lined the shelves. Dean noted the handwritten tags identifying the contents—many of them could be used in black magic: calamus root, mustard seed, valerian root, black pepper, licorice root chips. But a lot of them were harmless potpourri fillers too: lavender, lemongrass, sandalwood. Dean wondered if this store catered for the local witches.</p><p>The store also had a lot of other junk found everywhere in New England, including the all-pervasive Yankee candles, cheap Chinese-made cut-glass candy dishes, and black soap shaped like cats and witches’ hats.</p><p>“Hiya!”</p><p>A young girl of about twenty appeared through a door covered with a bead curtain. The strings of glass moved and clinked together as the Perky Polly jumped behind the counter.</p><p>“Welcome to ‘Connie’s Curios and Conversations,’ what can I do you for?” The girl was dressed in a long hippy-like skirt, with a couple of scarves wrapped around her waist. She wore a little charm on a black-leather bracelet around her wrist.</p><p>“Whoa Mom, can I get this?” Ben said, holding up an alligator foot.</p><p>“What on earth for?” Lisa responded.</p><p>“Hoodoo spell, brings luck, sometimes love. Wouldn’t be the dumbest thing to carry on your date tomorrow,” Dean said to Ben.</p><p>“You’re not helping!” Lisa glared at Dean. “It’s not a date, is it, Ben?”</p><p>Dean winked at Ben over Lisa’s head. Ben shook his head.</p><p>“Nope, Ma. It’s not a date. I promise,” he said with a smirk.</p><p>“Let me know if you need anything!” the girl called again. “You know your witchcraft,” she added, eyeing Dean.</p><p>“Yeah, you know. I just dabble,” he said as he looked around the store. “You’re well stocked. Got any puppy heads?”</p><p>“Dean!” Lisa swung round and looked at him.</p><p>The girl behind the counter suddenly lost her perk. Her face tightened.</p><p>“No we don’t,” she said brusquely.</p><p>“Oh okay, just wondering,” Dean said. He fingered the gris-gris bag in his pocket. If this girl was a witch or tried to mess with him, he was protected. Puppy skulls, ground puppy skulls, were used in some of the darkest spells, specifically in hoodoo, to bind demons. And by making the material into a ball, covering it in sulfur, and burying it where a person would walk over it—some believed that it could kill.</p><p>The girl held up a jade necklace with charms hanging from it.</p><p>“You know what? This would look gorgeous on you,” she said to Lisa.</p><p>Lisa appraised it. “It’s pretty, I don’t know if it’s my style though,” she said.</p><p>“You want to try it on?” the girl asked.</p><p>Dean stepped closer to the counter and leaned over toward the girl.</p><p>“It’s not really her thing,” he said. “Let’s go guys.”</p><p>Dean walked out of the store, Lisa and Ben following behind.</p><p>“What did you do that for?” Lisa asked, falling into step with Dean.</p><p>“That necklace had a black cat’s bone on it,” he said.</p><p>“Really?” Ben said. “Cool.”</p><p>“It did? What would that do?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“It would have helped her trace where you were. Sort of like a witch GPS. I should go in there and bust that shop up,” Dean growled.</p><p>“Dean, really, I think you’re mistaken. I’m sure she was just a hippy girl trying to do her job,” Lisa insisted.</p><p>“Maybe,” Dean said.</p><p>Whether the girl was a witch or not, there was something about her that Dean didn’t trust. Despite all the fru-fru stuff in the store, a real witch could stock up on some powerful stuff in there if they knew what they were doing.</p><p>Lisa, Ben, and Dean wound their way back to the inn. Dean hesitated when they got to the door.</p><p>“Hey, I’m going to continue to look around,” Dean said.</p><p>“Really?” Lisa asked</p><p>“Yeah, I’ll be back soon. Rest up.” Dean waved away her concern. “I just want to check the place out.”</p><p>“Okay, see you later,” Lisa said, and she and Ben disappeared into the inn.</p><p>Dean quickly walked across the street and popped the trunk to the CRV. His close parking job made it difficult to get it open. Dean struggled, trying not to hit the hood of the car behind it. The Impala wouldn’t have this problem.</p><p>He wanted to go back to the store and see what he could get out of the hippy chick, but something caught his attention. He looked up at the inn across the street and saw Ben in the window of their room. His eyes were as wide as saucers and he was beating on the window trying to get Dean’s attention.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle, which was stuffed into the wheel well of the spare tire, slammed the door shut, then ran back across the street.</p><p>SCREEECH!</p><p>A car ground to a halt, its grill a mere three inches away from Dean’s kneecaps.</p><p>Dean looked up again. Ben had disappeared from the window. He ran inside, startling Ingrid.</p><p>“Oh, Mr. Winchester, do you—“ she called.</p><p>“No time, Bea Arthur,” Dean yelled over his shoulder as he took the stairs three at a time. He reached the landing and spun around, almost knocking Ben over.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Dean asked, grabbing Ben’s arm and heading toward the door of their room.</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t—“ the boy stammered, he looked scared.</p><p>Inside, Lisa was curled on the bed, sweat dripping off her forehead. Her eyes were glassy and rolling up into their lids.</p><p>“Lis, Lis? can you hear me? Did you drink anything?” Dean shook her and frantically looked around the room. He picked up an open water bottle and smelled it. Nothing.</p><p>Lisa was shaking all over and her hands had palsied and curled up under her chin.</p><p>“What’s wrong with her?” Ben asked, his eyes watering with fear.</p><p>“Ben, I need you to search around the room. See if you find anything like this,” Dean said, taking the gris-gris bag out of his pocket. “Can you do that for me?”</p><p>“Yeah. Yeah,” Ben said.</p><p>“Look underneath everything, inside everything,” Dean directed. “Lisa, stay with me. What did you touch? Did you eat anything?”</p><p>Her body shook. Blood trickled from her mouth. She started coughing.</p><p>“Dean, what’s happening?” she sputtered.</p><p>“Just stay with me,” Dean said urgently.</p><p>“Dean?” Lisa choked. She reached into her mouth and tugged at something, a creature emerged from between her lips, wriggling in her grip. Staring at it in horror, she screamed and fainted. The lizard scampered away to the corner of the room.</p><p>“Mom!” Ben yelled.</p><p>“Okay, just stay calm. We have to find the bag,” Dean instructed.</p><p>He took out his knife and sliced straight through the butter-colored wing-back chair in the corner. He flipped it over and dug through the springs with the blade. Nothing. He pulled all the covers off the other queen-sized bed, flipped the mattress, tore through the box spring. Nothing.</p><p>In the bathroom Dean poured out every lotion, tossed every towel onto the floor. Nothing.</p><p>He stomped back to the bedroom window and pulled down the curtains, kicking through the pleats.</p><p>Still unconscious, Lisa fell from the bed and was now writhing on the floor, but no more lizards appeared from her throat.</p><p>Then Dean saw it, a little bag sitting on the table underneath an aging, dried bouquet of magnolias. He picked it up and opened it. Inside was some dragon’s blood, a black cat’s bone, thyme, and, Dean guessed, a couple of different kinds of oil.</p><p>“What is it?” Ben asked.</p><p>“It’s a hex bag and it’s making your mom sick,” Dean said as he took out his Zippo and lit it. The felt bag went up in flames and Dean dropped it into the trash can to smolder.</p><p>They gently lifted Lisa back onto the bed, and after a few moments she opened her eyes and rubbed her throat.</p><p>“What happened?” she asked.</p><p>“We had company. How do you feel?” Dean helped her sit up on the bed, gently brushing her hair away from her clammy forehead.</p><p>“I’m okay, I think. Who did this? What’s going on?” Lisa gestured to the destroyed room.</p><p>“Don’t worry, Ben and I had to find what was making you sick, but it’s all right now. Or it will be—I’ll fix it. I got to go out for a short while. Will you be okay here?” Dean didn’t want to scare her, but he had to go and find whoever had done this. Maybe that little witch in the strange store could give him some answers.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Lisa looked at him, eyes wide and fearful.</p><p>“I won’t be long,” Dean said, leaning down and kissing her hot cheek. He then pulled his duffle onto his shoulder and looked at Ben. “Take care of your mom and stay here—okay?”</p><p>Ben nodded his head solemnly.</p><p>With a lowered voice Dean said, “Let’s not tell your mom about what just happened if she doesn’t remember. Okay?”</p><p>Ben nodded again, glancing at his mom with worried eyes. Dean reasoned he didn’t need to tip Lisa off that there was something rotten in Salem—there was no reason to make her afraid and he could fix this.</p><p>Dean closed the door behind him, then turned and came face to face with a red-faced Ingrid.</p><p>“Sorry about the noise. Charades. So much fun. I’ll pay for the damages,” Dean said, brushing past them and heading down the stairs.</p><p>Dean kicked open the inn door and headed outside. He felt the outline of his gun in his duffle bag. He wasn’t quite sure where he was going to go, but he knew one thing: There were witches in Salem.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twelve">CHAPTER TWELVE</span><a href="#chapter-twelve" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Pull over here,” Samuel instructed.</p><p>Sam had pulled off Route 95 and into the area around Salem known as Danvers. He then pulled the van into a motel with a colonial theme. They unloaded their gear and Samuel checked them in under aliases.</p><p>Being in Salem at the same time as Dean posed a couple of problems. Sam would have to stay pretty much hidden, which would be difficult. His six-foot-four frame stood out anywhere. It might also cause some awkwardness if Dean caught sight of his long-dead grandfather.</p><p>To Sam it wasn’t quite clear why they were here, but he had learned over the past couple of months to do what he was told. If Samuel had a reason to be here, so did he. If there were witches in Salem, Sam had plenty of experience with them and he knew that they were bad news.</p><p>Samuel and Sam walked side by side, lugging their gear towards their respective rooms.</p><p>“We can get a bead on Dean tomorrow,” Samuel proposed. “Shouldn’t be too hard, kid has the manners of a drunken ox.”</p><p>“Actually, I think I’m going to go look around now,” Sam said.</p><p>Samuel shrugged. “Fine. Just try to keep your big mug out of sight.”</p><p>Sam nodded. After throwing his gear into his room, he made his way back to the van.</p><p>First he drove through the parking lots of every motel in the surrounding area, but he didn’t spot Dean’s car. Next, he decided to swing by the more touristy part of town. No sign of Dean. Then, as he turned a corner onto a smaller side street, he glanced into the narrow alley behind the buildings, and caught a glimpse of his brother as he ducked into a recess at the back of an old clapboard building.</p><p>Sam swung around front and parked his van on the street in front of a shop. He hopped out and peered in through the shop windows and clocked all the herbs in jars. He figured that Dean had come to the same conclusion he had—this place screamed witchcraft.</p><p>Daylight broke through the back of the store. It looked as though someone had just kicked in the back door. Wary of breaking Samuel’s rules and encountering his brother, Sam decided to wait inside the van.</p><p>The store was closed from what Dean could see. The town seemed to be quickly closing down in the evening light. Around back he examined the door to the shop.</p><p>“No Ye Olde Alarm System?” he muttered to himself.</p><p>Dean’s foot went clear through the rotting, wooden back door. His foot hit right near the lock, tearing it off its hinges so it hung lopsided, like a tongue hanging out of a dog’s mouth.</p><p>Gun at the ready, Dean snuck into the back room of the store. Through the dim light he could see boxes and boxes of witch-themed items stacked on top of one another.</p><p>“Connie’s Curios and Crap,” Dean murmured.</p><p>He moved through to the main store. He figured that in his short time in Salem he had pissed someone off and while he, Lisa, and Ben were out, that someone had snuck into the hotel room and planted the bag. The hex put on Lisa had been strong. It took someone with a pretty potent knowledge of the black arts to put together a hex bag like that.</p><p>Dean moved through the shop, eyes peeled for anything suspicious. He poked around the counter near the register. Nothing of interest. To his right he noticed a steep staircase leading to the second floor.</p><p>Dean peeked through the narrow opening, up the twisting staircase. <span class="italic">Hobbit sized,</span> he thought. <span class="italic">Ugh.</span> Dean twisted around and pulled himself up the stairs, leading with his sawed-off. At the top was a pokey little hallway.</p><p>Floorboards creaked under Dean’s weight. He winced.</p><p>WHAACK!</p><p>Dean felt the burning sensation radiate through the back of his head and down his spine as he fell forward onto his stomach. The sawed-off skittered across the wide-planked floor and came to rest under a heating unit. Above him, the hippy girl stood, a baseball bat emblazoned with a Red Sox emblem in her hands.</p><p>“Jesus Christ, Janice Joplin, take it easy,” Dean said, rubbing the back of his head. He inspected a smudge of blood on his fingers.</p><p>“What’re you doing here? Didn’t you see the ‘Closed’ sign on the door? Or do you New York folks always just do what you want and walk in like you own the place?” she demanded.</p><p>“Whoa, hold it. First off, I’m not from New York. Secondly, I was in here an hour ago with my girlfriend—“</p><p>“That was your girlfriend? You look like her dad.”</p><p>“What?” Dean put his hands up in a placatory gesture. “Okay, you can ‘What to Wear’ me a makeover later. The door downstairs was open.”</p><p>“Open like falling open or unlocked? Because I’m pretty sure the hinges didn’t shatter by themselves.”</p><p>Dean shrugged, then pulled himself onto his feet.</p><p>“Can I finish? I’m here, then I go back to my hotel. Next thing I know my girlfriend’s coughing up the GEICO gecko.”</p><p>“Lizards? Who’d you piss off?” she asked.</p><p>“That’s why I’m here. I came to find out.”</p><p>“Not me. I don’t do that revenge spell stuff.” The girl went to sit by the small slanted windows. “That’s more Connie’s bag than mine.”</p><p>“So you’re not Connie?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No. I’m Sukie. Nice to meet you,” she said dryly.</p><p>“Like Sukie Stackhouse?”</p><p>“God, no. Go back farther. Sukie Ridgemont, Michele Pfeiffer’s character in <span class="italic">Witches of Eastwick?</span> I was born the same year the movie came out. Thus the name.”</p><p>“So where’s Connie?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Connie’s a strange bird. I don’t see her much. I open and close the place most days. Occasionally I find a note from her telling me to wash the windows. That’s about it. Why do you want to talk to her?”</p><p>“You have some really strong ingredients downstairs, stuff that could be used in some pretty powerful spells. Plus, you tried to sell my girlfriend a necklace with a black cat’s bone on it.”</p><p>“I did? I didn’t know that.”</p><p>“You didn’t know there was a black cat’s bone on something you sell?”</p><p>“No. I mean— Listen, I mostly do love spells, money spells, whatever. Just some herbs, a candle and a little chanting. I stay away from any hardcore stuff. Plus, Connie is the one that stocks all the shelves. Actually, she called this morning and told me to push the necklaces on anyone that came in. So I did. I really didn’t know there was a cat’s bone on it. She’s the one with... umm... She dabbles in the darker stuff, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>“Dabbles in witchcraft? How do you ‘dabble’ in witchcraft?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Okay, fine. She’s like really, really into it. I try not to get in her way. Connie’s like old school, been in town forever, way before the Skechers store and the yogurt shops started opening up.”</p><p>“So, you’re a good witch?” Dean raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Just call me Glinda,” Sukie said.</p><p>“Right, I get it. So where can I find this Connie? If she’s pretty hooked in, I’d like to talk to her.”</p><p>“Umm. I guess I can tell you where she lives.” Sukie shrugged. “Her old family place, last name of Hennrick. Go north out of town, you can’t miss it. What did you say your name was?”</p><p>“I didn’t,” Dean said.</p><p>“Weird, ‘cause you look sorta familiar. You have family in town?”</p><p>“What’s with the <span class="italic">Who Do You Think You Are?</span> genealogy questions?” Dean said, a little miffed.</p><p>“Wow, way to go for the Friday night TV. Were you under house arrest? No one watches that.”</p><p>“Okay, Glinda, I’m out of here. And since you beaned me with a bat, I expect you’re going to forget that your back door had an accident.”</p><p>“Like I said, I have a wealth spell. I’m not worried,” Sukie said.</p><p>Dean wanted to find Lisa’s attacker, but was beginning to get the distinct feeling that there was more to Salem than he had first thought. He left by the broken back door.</p><p>At the front of the store, Sam got out of his truck and peeked through the window. He spotted a shopgirl and banged on the glass.</p><p>She looked up and mouthed, “We’re closed.”</p><p>“I just have a quick question,” Sam yelled, indicating he needed her to open the door.</p><p>“Dude, come back tomorrow.” She shook her head and went to the back of the store.</p><p>Sam cautiously doubled back to the alley where he had seen Dean. The coast was clear. Sam walked up the alley and peeked his head through the doorway. The girl stood there surveying the damage to the door.</p><p>“I just have a couple questions,” Sam said.</p><p>“Listen Bigfoot, I’m already late, so if you don’t mind, I’m just going to close this here door on your face and you can come back tomorrow to get your glow-in-the-dark witch mask.”</p><p>“Okay Sabrina, cut the crap,” Sam said, his patience at an end. “I’m going to ask you some questions and you’re gonna flap those sweet hippy lips of yours. Get it?”</p><p>“Oh wow, the sensitivity training is doing wonders. You throw any puppies into rivers lately? Tell me, how do you feel?” The girl had lost her fresh-faced gaze, and she now looked decidedly mean. “Because I’ve seen corpses before, but never one walking and talking like you. Though you don’t so much walk as lumber.”</p><p>“What the hell are you on about?” Sam demanded. He hadn’t met many people who could tell straight off that he was... unusual.</p><p>“Puh-lease, you can see your silly walk from a mile away.”</p><p>“I meant about me,” Sam growled.</p><p>“I’m a witch, lug-head. I got powers. I can feel things. You’re off. Can’t you feel that?”</p><p>Sam wasn’t in an introspective mood.</p><p>“What’d you say to him?” He inclined his head down the alley, in the direction Dean had presumably headed.</p><p>The girl smirked. “Who? The guy that just left? He your shower-buddy or something? You guys look similar—same Cro-Magnon brow.”</p><p>“He’s my... Forget it. What did he want?” Sam demanded.</p><p>“His girlfriend got sick. He thought someone like me or my boss might have hexed her. We carry a lot of shit here. I told him I didn’t do anything. He and the chick seemed harmless. I might have mentioned that my boss was into heavier shit. But that’s it. I sent him on his way. I don’t need people up in my grill. I played it nice and sweet with him. You, I don’t like too much.”</p><p>“Well, glad I’m getting to see the real you. What about the other witch-bitches around here, know anything about what they’re doing?”</p><p>“I don’t hang with anyone else if that’s what you mean. I live with my mom, who makes soap for a living. I work, I text my boyfriend, and occasionally I rearrange my Netflix queue. Like I told the other guy, not everyone with a gift hangs around together here. I know it’s Salem, but we don’t all put on witchy hats and ride around on brooms.”</p><p>“And that guy just went away, you didn’t tell him anything else?” Sam was skeptical this chick was telling the truth.</p><p>“Yawn. Yes, and no. Can I go now?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Sam spun around on his heel and walked back down the alley.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” the girl shouted after him. “Dick.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirteen">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-thirteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A cool evening fog rolled in from the ocean. Dean walked back toward the inn. He took a shortcut through an old graveyard. Under normal circumstances Dean would end up digging and burning things when he was in a bone yard, but he found himself looking at the worn stone faces of various headstones. Lichen stuck to the weathered stones, making some of the names difficult to read. Nevertheless Dean found himself enthralled. These people had all been accused of witchcraft.</p><p>Dean knew a little about the history of the Salem witch trials. He supposed that maybe the people lying underfoot could actually have been witches, in that case, good riddance to them. But he also knew that envy and suspicion could cause a lot more harm than a couple of people doing spells so their crops didn’t die.</p><p>Dean reached the inn, crossed the street and threw his duffle in the trunk of the car. He supposed that he should probably go up and see how Lisa and Ben were doing, he peered up at their bedroom window, the curtains were tightly drawn. But he really wanted to find this Connie woman. If she practiced the dark arts like her employee said, then she might be behind the attack on Lisa. She also might be powerful enough to be able to help him raise Sam. Either way, Dean needed to find out more information before he confronted Connie Hennrick.</p><p>Closing the trunk, Dean headed into the lobby of the inn. Ingrid smiled saltily from behind the counter. She waved Dean over. In front of her was an itemized bill of the damage to their room.</p><p>“I’m having the curtains and floor professionally cleaned. The fire you started in the waste basket smelled everything up. I’ve also moved you all to a different room.”</p><p>Dean nodded and thanked her. He really didn’t care. But now more than ever he wished they were staying in one of his usual crap-hole motels. He put on his sweetest smile.</p><p>“Ingrid, if I wanted to find out information about a family who’s been in Salem for a while, where would I go? Is there a library in town or something?” Even in the age of the Internet, some information could only be culled from old-fashioned records.</p><p>“There’s the Peabody Essex Museum. Not walking distance though. Lots of tourists go there to see if they were related to anyone in the Salem witch trials. My great, great, great, great grandmother lived in Boston and her husband came up to see the Court of Oyer and Terminer.”</p><p>“The court of what?” Dean asked.</p><p>“It’s the court that heard the testimony of all the girls accusing people of being witches. In any case, Peabody Museum. Look up your ancestor names. Though I never heard of Winchesters in Salem.”</p><p>“Probably not. Thanks for the info,” Dean said.</p><p>Dean made his way back out of the door again. After changing into a tweed jacket and khakis—his professor outfit—Dean followed his GPS to the museum.</p><p>An old woman in a beige pantsuit was just locking the door from the inside as Dean walked up. He rapped on the glass panel of the door and mustered his most academic-looking smile, pressing a Harvard ID up against the glass.</p><p>The old woman unlocked the door.</p><p>“Sorry, we’re closed. Come back tomorrow,” she said and went to close the door again.</p><p>Dean stuck his foot against it to stop her. He smiled winningly.</p><p>“Pardon my tardiness,” he began, and cleared his throat. “I’m Doctor Jones from Harvard. I have a lecture tomorrow and I’m terribly behind on a crucial part of my research. Is there any way...?” Dean gestured with his hand.</p><p>The old woman looked him over. Dean beamed at her, turning up the charm another notch and keeping his foot in place against the door.</p><p>It must have worked as she smiled brightly back at him, nodded, opened the door and ushered Dean into a wood-paneled room.</p><p>“Now what family are you looking for, Doctor Jones?” she asked Dean, moving behind the counter.</p><p>“I’m actually looking for information on the Hennricks,” Dean said.</p><p>“Humm, I’m not sure if we have much on that family. Let me see,” she said, taking a list from a draw in the table.</p><p>Dean peered at it from upside down, it seemed to be a list of families starting from when Salem was first settled in 1628.</p><p>“Hmm. Abbey, Adams, Allen, Baily, Bayley, Bibber, Churchill, Campbell, Cory—“</p><p>“Wait,” Dean said, taking the paper and flipping it so he could read it the right way round. “Campbell?”</p><p>“Yes, right here.” She jabbed the paper. “Not much there though, if I remember correctly. I can get the box for you, if you want.”</p><p>“Yes please,” Dean said.</p><p>The old woman disappeared for a few minutes and then shuffled back holding a dusty box.</p><p>“This is all we have on the Campbells. Let me know if you need anything else,” she said. “I have a few things to finish up so I can give you about half an hour.”</p><p>Dean nodded and thanked her. She left him to it and he sat down at one of the dark-wood tables near by and opened up the box.</p><p>Inside was an old leather journal, imprinted in faded gold script “Nathaniel Campbell.” Dean carefully opened the cottony, yellowed pages.</p><p>He had never heard of any Campbell relatives in Salem, Massachusetts. Though he didn’t know about many relatives past his grandparents, Samuel and Deanna. But whoever this Nathaniel Campbell was, it seemed he was an avid journal writer.</p><p>Dean peered at the first page, it was dated 1664. A flowing brown script spread across the page. He began to read:</p><blockquote><p>I signed the homestead papers today with the honorable Cotton Mather. The price is three English pounds each year hence. The property starts around twenty meters from the old oak tree at the corner of the road to Ipswich. It runs around 500 meters wide and some 2,000 meters deep. On the west side it is bordered by a small brook, and on the south by the river that runs to Ipswich.</p></blockquote><p>Dean stopped reading and flipped through a couple more pages. On a page dated “Feb. 1692” something caught his eye:</p><blockquote><p>A young girl’s body was found north of the village today. Abigail Faulkner age 14 was found in the snow with her throat cut. I asked the village doctor, William Grigg, if I could see the body to give the poor girl her Last Rites. I got there before Reverend Parris—otherwise he surely would have raised a big fuss and then I would not have been able to examine her. The Widow Faulkner did not want to delay one minute, lest her daughter not rise up to Heaven. She gave me permission to administer them. I insisted on having a moment or two alone with the body first in order to “make it right and proper” for the widow to see her daughter. In that short amount of time I came to a couple of clear conclusions that I am sure the good physician will not. Namely, the girl’s neck was broken, even though it was sliced, the neck bones were pulverized, as if by a regular wood-chopping axe. But there was no bruising in the back of her neck. I fear the force might have come from something otherworldly. I am quite sure I exterminated the witches some years back, but perhaps more have fallen under the dark spell of Satan. I can only hope not.</p><p>But I fear that my sons may be correct: Witches are again in Salem.</p></blockquote><p>Dean sat back and stared at the page. Could this be the journal of his ancestor? Could Nathaniel Campbell be a great, great, great grandfather on his mother’s side? Dean shuddered. He had to read the rest of the journal.</p><p>Rising from his seat he peered out into the dark corridor beyond the wood-paneled room. The click, click, click of the docent’s heels pierced the silence. Dean always carried his father’s journal in his jacket pocket. With Sam gone, Dean really had nothing else to connect him to his family. He removed the leather cover of Nathaniel’s journal with his pocket knife, then carefully wrapped it around John Winchester’s. They were of a similar weight and size and surely no one else would be coming to look at an old Campbell family journal. When Dean was finished he would return and switch them back.</p><p>“Did you find what you were looking for?” the old woman asked as Dean passed her on his way out.</p><p>“And more,” Dean said.</p><p>Dean drove back to the bed and breakfast and was relieved to find Lisa and Ben watching TV and eating burgers they had ordered from the inn’s kitchen—one waited for him as well.</p><p>Lisa said she was feeling better, but she still looked pale. She said she was going to rally in the morning so they could go see the clipper ships. Ben proceeded to speak in a pirate accent for the rest of the night.</p><p>Dean munched his burger and then sat back on the other bed and took out the pages of Nathaniel Campbell’s journal.</p><p>“What’s that?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Just something I picked up from the library,” Dean replied.</p><p>He started to read about a family of hunters named Campbell.</p><h2><span id="chapter-fourteen">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-fourteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Caleb Campbell and his older brother by three years, Thomas, were walking back from the village when they saw a man and his cart emerge from a little-used road that ran to the northwest. He was wild-eyed and perspiring as he approached the boys.</p><p>“The Devil has been let out, boys. Get thee home and lock the door,” the man yelled.</p><p>“Why sir?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“‘Tis the Devil himself killed a poor little thing. Too gruesome for children like you to see.”</p><p>The man indicated a wrapped bundle in the back of his simple horse cart. Two snow-covered shoes peeped out from beneath the burlap covering. It was a dead body, and from the size of the feet, and style of shoe, it was that of a young girl.</p><p>The man hastened his horses toward Salem Village.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb looked at one another.</p><p>“It’s about time,” Caleb said. “This village was putting me to sleep.”</p><p>Even in the wintry light, Caleb’s sandy-blond hair shone like a summer sun. He had dark eyes and a wide-set mouth. Though he was the younger of the two Campbell brothers, he was by far the better student.</p><p>Thomas was already acquiring his adolescent brawn. The breadth of his shoulders had outgrown his coat. His mother had tanned a couple of hides from the previous winter’s hunt and sewn him a jacket. It was all deer hide, burnished to a walnut brown. She had pulled the collar up to cover most of Thomas’s neck and sewn two large pockets for his mittens, which he would surely lose several times that winter. Thomas’s coat didn’t look like any of the other boys’ clothes in town. But that was the way all the Campbells were—they didn’t quite fit in.</p><p>The Campbell family had come from Europe with the wave of English-speaking settlers in the mid-1600s. No one knew exactly which country they had originated from. They traded a few of their crops in the village, but for the most part they kept to themselves. They did not attend church, which sparked the ire of many townspeople, in particular the new minister, Reverend Parris.</p><p>Nathaniel Campbell wasn’t a religious man anyway, but he didn’t trust Reverend Parris. He told his children never to trust a man so desperate for adoration and attention. “A man such as that can be dangerous,” Nathaniel warned his family. It was for that reason Nathaniel told the clergyman that they would worship at home on Sundays and Thursdays, the days when people gathered in the tavern to talk about the Bible. Though in fact, rather than worshipping, Nathaniel made his three children study.</p><p>The Campbell children weren’t learning the Bible—they already knew it back to front—instead they were studying Latin, herbs, and texts about monsters that their ancestors had written. The family business was hunting and it was very important to Nathaniel that his two sons and daughter continue the Campbell tradition.</p><p>Thomas looked at his brother.</p><p>“You go tell Father and I’ll follow that man to town,” he said.</p><p>“Why do you get to follow him? I want to follow him,” Caleb objected.</p><p>“Because I’m older, and if I’m caught I’m better spoken,” Thomas responded.</p><p>Caleb shook his head but started toward the family farm anyway, while his brother ran after the man and his cart.</p><p>Thomas was fast and caught up with the man’s tired mare before it had reached Salem. In the village the visitor stopped and asked a local resident where to find the nearest doctor. He was directed toward the east end of town, and Thomas followed cautiously from a distance.</p><p>When they reached the doctor’s, he waited a short way down the street, crouched down next to another cart, while the man stepped inside.</p><p>A couple of minutes later the portly physician emerged from the house and approached the cart. He scooped up the body of the young girl and hurried back inside.</p><p>Thomas ran to the window of the doctor’s house and peered through the tiny glass pane. The men were laying the young girl’s body on a table.</p><p>Thomas grew anxious. He knew that his father would want to find out what had killed the girl, and he could only do that by examining the body.</p><p>The ways Nathaniel could gain access to the bodies were many, but normally he would lie and dissemble. If they were in another town or county Nathaniel would dress up as a man of the church, or sometimes pose as a merchant or a judge. Nathaniel always kept a couple of changes of clothes in his sack for these exact occasions. He would insist that he needed to see the body before anyone else did. Once he had gained access, he was usually quick to identify the culprit.</p><p>Thomas knew that his father was used to seeing strange animal bites or scratches. He knew what kind of mark a wendigo made—his Indian friends had helped him identify the first one he had ever come across. But such things would have induced panic in the common colonist. Even though the Bible played the primary cultural role in Puritan communities, Christianity couldn’t quash the inherent folk beliefs that people had brought over from Europe.</p><p>Many of the colonists were superstitious: the English spoke of baby-stealing fairies, the French of <span class="italic">loup-garou,</span> and German merchants of <span class="italic">Vampir.</span> So Nathaniel often hid evidence of those creatures, for the safety of the colony. Sometimes he would patch the wounds up on the victim’s corpse before anyone else could see them—he carried a candle for just that purpose, to drip wax into the wounds to hide them.</p><p>Before Thomas could come up with a plan to gain access alone, his father and Caleb arrived at the doctor’s in their rickety carriage. Thomas could make out the outline of the worn book of Latin spells inside his father’s coat. He always carried it with him just in case the victim was demonically possessed.</p><p>Nathaniel jumped out of the carriage as Caleb tied the horse to a post. Nathaniel nodded to Thomas and entered the doctor’s house.</p><p>Caleb left the horse and crossed the street toward his brother. The boys listened quietly at the window. They understood immediately that the men had identified the girl: Abigail Faulkner. She lived with her mother and two lame twin brothers just north of town on a small plot of land only big enough for a couple of pigs and a vegetable garden. Thomas and Caleb knew her only by sight.</p><p>Inside the house, the men decided that they had to tell Abigail’s mother what had happened, and the doctor’s servant girl was sent to fetch Widow Faulkner.</p><p>The widow arrived some twenty minutes later, already upset. Abigail hadn’t returned home from a quilting circle she had attended at the Putnam household with a couple of other girls the previous evening. Her mother thought perhaps she had stayed the night with the girls and would return home today, but she had not.</p><p>Nathaniel gently explained to her what had happened and showed the widow her daughter’s body. Straight away she began to wail and weep. Nathaniel spoke to her in calm tones, telling her that he should administer the Last Rites immediately. Eventually she seemed to understand and nodded, allowing the doctor and the other man to help her into another room.</p><p>Nathaniel closed the door behind them then went to the window and opened it. His sons waited beneath.</p><p>“Hand me my bag. I haven’t much time,” Nathaniel directed.</p><p>They swiftly hoisted their father’s large leather bag in through the window, and Nathaniel got to work. First he examined the girl’s limbs looking for any strange bites or marks, besides the obvious cut through her throat. He found nothing. There was no smell of sulfur or scorching around the mouth, so no demons had been involved with her death.</p><p>Next Nathaniel took some herbs from his bag. He sprinkled them over the girl’s body, lit a candle and chanted some Latin phrases. Nothing happened. Nathaniel looked at her palms and feet—nothing suspicious there either.</p><p>Finally he checked the back of her neck, and gently probing with his fingertips he realized something very strange—her neck was completely limp.</p><p>Nathaniel went briefly into the other room to speak to the widow, and thank the doctor and the man. He then took his leave.</p><p>When their father emerged from the house, Caleb and Thomas jumped onto the cart. Nathaniel reigned the horses in silence, and the boys knew better than to speak to their father when he was deep in thought.</p><p>Once they were near the edge of the village, Nathaniel spoke.</p><p>“Her neck was completely broken,” he stated.</p><p>“Broken?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Like a chicken’s. But there wasn’t any bruising. Usually, such as with a hanging, there would be bruising,” Nathaniel mused darkly.</p><p>“How was it broken?” Thomas asked.</p><p>Nathaniel shook his head.</p><p>“There’s one obvious way to break a neck without touching someone.”</p><p>“Black magic?” Caleb hazarded.</p><p>“Exactly.” His father nodded.</p><p>“Didn’t her mother say that she was at a quilting circle at the Putnam household?” Thomas offered.</p><p>“Indeed,” Nathaniel said. “You boys go round to the Putnam house. Take some eggs. Say you want to trade with them. Find out when exactly Abigail Faulkner was there last. Also, look for any signs of witchery.”</p><p>“Yes, sir, right away,” Thomas said. He grabbed his brother, climbing off the cart and pulling Caleb after him. They grabbed a basket of fresh eggs off the back of the cart. In their line of business it was wise to always carry something to trade.</p><p>The boys waved goodbye to their father and trudged through deep snow back toward the village.</p><p>The Putnam house was just off Old Meetinghouse Road. When they reached the residence, they climbed the steps to the imposing front door and knocked determinedly. The echoing sound of their knocking was followed by a piercing scream from inside the building, then the heavy tromp of boots could be heard approaching the front door. There was another scream, and then a man with a long nose and a small birdlike bridge to his face opened the door.</p><p>It was Reverend Parris. His face was wracked with pain.</p><p>“What is it, boys?” Reverend Parris asked.</p><p>“We’ve come to trade some eggs and perhaps speak to Anne and Prudence? Is everything all right?” Thomas asked boldly, trying to peer around the figure of the clergyman to see what was happening inside.</p><p>Just then another scream came from inside the house and Anne Putnam, a small twelve-year-old girl, appeared behind Reverend Parris. She had a wild look in her eyes. She looked at Caleb, them being the same age, then grabbed his arm and tried to pull him into the house. Reverend Parris protested, grasping the girl’s wrist and freeing Caleb.</p><p>Mr. Putnam, Anne’s father, emerged into the hallway and the two men conferred briefly. Thomas and Caleb watched from the doorway.</p><p>“Come, come, you’ve come just in time,” Ann cried to Caleb. “See, see them there? Look how they scream at me. There, there! Up in the rafters!” She pointed toward the ceiling. The boys stepped cautiously into the hallway but when they looked up, they could see nothing unusal.</p><p>Another young girl, Prudence, who the boys knew to be Anne’s close friend, emerged from the shadows. She too seemed to be on the verge of hysteria. She cried out and fell on the ground, her body twisting into severe shapes and her tongue rolling out of her mouth.</p><p>As if suddenly noticing the boys’ presence, the Reverend pushed them back out of the front door.</p><p>“We have no time for you, boys,” he said. “Evil is upon us.” Just as he shut the door they heard Reverend Parris say to Mr. Putnam, “The same affliction has come to my house. My daughter and servant girl too scream out. It’s witches I tell you. Satan has come to Salem.”</p><p>As the boys went back down the steps, Thomas turned toward his younger brother.</p><p>“I think Anne Putnam has taken a shine to you.”</p><p>Caleb smirked at his brother’s sense of humor.</p><p>“Are you saying only a girl afflicted by an unseen force would like me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Thomas said matter-of-factly. “Let’s go tell Father that it seems these girls are troubled by witches.”</p><h2><span id="chapter-fifteen">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-fifteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Nathaniel Campbell and his family sat around the rough-hewn dinner table in front of the large hearth. The family was in deep discussion about the current events. Rose Mary Campbell filled everyone’s bowls with soup and a large crust of bread.</p><p>“I heard they’ve accused Parris’s servant, Tituba, as well as Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, of witchery,” Hannah said. She was the eldest child, a well-mannered, quick-witted, fearless whip of a girl.</p><p>Though she was often left behind by Nathaniel and the boys on some of their more dangerous hunts, Hannah always made herself useful. She was fluent in four languages, including the local Indian dialect, which had helped her learn some of their religious practices. Her father relied on her to figure out many of the spells and books that they referenced.</p><p>“So we know that Abigail Faulkner and Reverend Parris’s daughter attend a quilting circle with Anne Putnam and Prudence Lewis,” Hannah continued.</p><p>“And all four of those girls are claiming to be afflicted by witches,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Poor Sarah Good, Sarah Osborne, and Tituba. There will be a trial for those three I’m sure,” Rose Mary said. “Nothing gets Reverend Parris in more of a tizzy than the talk of evil. It is strange though, I’m sure they are just old women.”</p><p>“Are they witches, Father?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“I can’t be sure. I’ll try a marking spell on them, if I can get close to them at the trial. That should tell us for certain,” Nathaniel replied.</p><p>“I can’t imagine that those women are witches,” Hannah said. “Tituba seems like such a simple woman when I see her in the village.”</p><p>“Well then, who is afflicting the girls?” Caleb asked.</p><p>Hannah shrugged. “If I were a witch I wouldn’t be caught so easily. Don’t you think, Father?”</p><p>“The girls claim to be able to see the women afflicting them,” Nathaniel observed.</p><p>“Well, I can say a lot of things. I can say I see a horse with a lilac coat on in front of me. That doesn’t mean it’s true,” Hannah countered.</p><p>“I’ll try a marking spell on the three women. Then we’ll know for sure,” Nathaniel repeated.</p><p>“Do you think those women killed Abigail Faulkner?” Thomas asked.</p><p>Nathaniel thought about it for a moment.</p><p>“I think we can be sure that whomever killed Abigail is also afflicting the girls.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>A couple of days later, Reverend Parris’s servant Tituba, a slave he had brought with him to Salem from his time in the West Indies, was taken to the meetinghouse, along with the elderly Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne.</p><p>A great crowd gathered outside. Whispers of gossip swept through the people: four innocent girls were afflicted with horrible visions and manipulations by the women. <span class="italic">They must be witches,</span> the people murmured.</p><p>In the colonies, witchcraft was punishable by hanging, though in the past when accusations of witchcraft had erupted, no one had been hanged. But a particular fear struck everyone in the late winter of 1692.</p><p>All of New England was undergoing social and political upheaval and Salem had undergone a series of severe strains: The English and their impositions; as well as the raids by King Philip, the leader of the Wampanoag Indians, and his men, already had everyone on edge; and a smallpox epidemic had swept through much of New England.</p><p>On top of that, it had been a particularly cold winter and the people of Salem were desperate to escape their small smoky houses. Salem was infused with gossip and dispute, the people were restless and volatile and ready to believe the worst of their neighbors.</p><p>Nathaniel and his children pushed their way through the throng of people outside and managed to find standing places in the back of the meetinghouse. The interior of the building was carefully designed to instill fear into those being tried.</p><p>Along the far back wall two severe and imposing male figures, the judges, sat behind a long table. To the right of the table was a small platform with a banister, where the afflicted girls sat. The magistrates instructed the girls to face forward, toward them, but when the three accused women were brought in, the girls turned around and at the very sight of the women, started to writhe and scream. They pointed at the accused and cried that they had come to them as specters and asked them to sign the book of Satan. They claimed that when they refused, the women started to bewitch them.</p><p>Nathaniel, Hannah, Thomas, and Caleb carefully watched the young girls’ theatrics and observed the fear in the eyes of the accused women. The four girls seemed to be completely caught up in their own game. If one of the old women bent down, all the girls bent down and screamed that they were being forced to bend against their will. If one of them turned her head, all the girls screamed and turned their heads at unnatural angles.</p><p>To the crowd in the meetinghouse, watching with gasps of horror and mutterings about Satan, this was proof enough that the older women were witches. But the Campbell clan wanted further proof.</p><p>Nathaniel bent low and slipped two bags of herbs and oils into Hannah and Caleb’s hands.</p><p>“You’re going to have to get close to the women,” he murmured softly. “See if you can’t push your way to the front of the crowd. Place the bags under their chairs. I will then try to get close enough to do the rest.”</p><p>The children elbowed their way through the dense crowd. When they neared the front, Caleb burrowed his way forward until he was directly behind Tituba’s chair. He bent down as if to tie his shoelaces and quickly placed the bag in a corner of the chair spokes.</p><p>Being of slight build, Hannah managed to do the same for both Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, with ease. She then slipped back through the crowd to her father’s side.</p><p>As a fully-grown man, Nathaniel found it more difficult to get through the crowd. But eventually he reached the accused women. Trying to not to draw attention to himself, he began his chant, whispering just loudly enough for the marking spell to take effect.</p><p>“Nathaniel Campbell,” a deep voice called out over the din of the crowd and screaming girls, “are you also possessed by witches?”</p><p>Nathaniel looked up and caught the eye of his questioner, John Hathorne, who was one of the judges, though he had no formal legal experience. The man’s air was stately and his voice boomed over the packed meetinghouse.</p><p>“No sir,” Nathaniel replied, his voice calm and clear. “I am praying for the girls that they will be freed from their bewitching.”</p><p>This answer seemed to satisfy Hathorne and he nodded and turned back to the inquest. Nathaniel finished the chant. He then crouched down behind the women’s chairs and peered at the palms of their hands. There were no marks.</p><p>Satisfied, Nathaniel retreated and signaled to his children to leave.</p><p>They returned home in their cart through the village, which was semi-deserted since most of the people of Salem were still thronging around the meetinghouse.</p><p>“Those magistrates are idiots,” Thomas declared. “Can’t they see that those women aren’t hurting the girls?”</p><p>“Then who is?” Caleb put in.</p><p>“Do you think they are putting on a show, Father?” Hannah asked.</p><p>“I’m not sure if they are faking or not,” Nathaniel stated. “But I am sure that those three women aren’t witches. There was no marking spot on any of their palms. Which means either those girls are making it up or it is someone or something else harassing them.”</p><p>“But who would be doing that?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“I guess we will have to wait and see,” Nathaniel replied.</p><h2><span id="chapter-sixteen">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-sixteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Less than a week after the hearing, Thomas and Caleb were walking home from town. It was late in the day so they decided to take a shortcut in order to reach home before dark. The land they cut across belonged to Constance Ball, a tall, well-spoken haughty woman who was known to be very wealthy. Some in Salem said she had colluded with the French and the Dutch, and those associations had brought her great riches; other townspeople whispered that she had had much more sinister beginnings.</p><p>Constance Ball’s land stretched for a couple of miles around the large and imposing house that she owned. The boys walked quickly and carefully around the tree line, wary, as they knew they were trespassing.</p><p>As they rounded the back of the property, the boys noticed the Ball family graveyard. Like many homesteads a graveyard was kept on the family land, but this one struck the Campbell boys as strange—they could see two unearthed graves on the small plot of land on the edge of the pasture. Knowing their father would want to learn more, the boys crept closer and saw two old headstones, each with a death date carved on it. Was someone digging up dead bodies?</p><p>Thomas and Caleb realized immediately that they had discovered something important. They ran the rest of the way home. When they arrived, Nathaniel was just taking his horse out.</p><p>“Father, we have something to tell you,” Caleb said, hands on his knees as he caught his breath.</p><p>“Not now boys. Another body was found,” Nathaniel said, pulling himself into his saddle. “I’ve got to go examine it and see if the neck is broken.”</p><p>“We cut through Constance Ball’s land and found two graves,” Thomas said quickly. “The bodies had been unearthed. The ground was all dug up.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” his father asked, leaning down from his saddle.</p><p>They nodded.</p><p>“Well then, that’s something else to investigate,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Can we come with you?” Thomas asked eagerly.</p><p>“Aren’t you two chilled to the bone? I won’t be back until long after dark.”</p><p>“I’d rather go with you,” Caleb said.</p><p>Nathaniel shrugged and hoisted Caleb up onto a small half-saddle that sat forward on the horse and moved off, Thomas jogged by their side.</p><p>When they arrived at Reverend Parris’s parsonage, Nathaniel sent the boys to the back of the house. He was going to try to convince Reverend Parris that he should be allowed to see the latest body, but if he could not, the boys would have to try and get a look at it another way.</p><p>Shivering in the cold and dark but eager to see the latest developments, Thomas and Caleb peeked through those windows they could reach.</p><p>Inside the house, Nathaniel spoke with Reverend Parris.</p><p>“Reverend, if I may, I’d like to see the latest body that was found.”</p><p>“Absolutely not. Can’t you see what disarray my house is in?” Reverend Parris threw his arms wide. Just then, a female screamed upstairs. “As you know, my daughter and servant girl are bewitched by those vile women.”</p><p>“But the women are incarcerated—has this not stopped the affliction?” Nathaniel questioned.</p><p>Reverend Parris stared at Nathaniel.</p><p>“Satan does not rest in one place, Nathaniel. He can live anywhere, bewitch anyone. There are more witches in Salem and I aim to find them.”</p><p>“And I would like to help you. But I can only do that if I see the body.”</p><p>“The dead man was a transient. No one in town knows him. He is of no use to you,” the clergyman said.</p><p>“How did Sarah Good and Sarah Osborne, and your own Tituba, kill this transient then? If they were not familiar with him, how would they have done such a thing? They’ve been in the Salem Town jail since the week before last.”</p><p>* * *</p><p>Observing through the windows that their father was having little success in persuading the Reverend to let him view the body, Thomas and Caleb found their way into the root cellar beneath the house. There they found the dead body of the strange man lying on the straw floor. The cellar was dark and stuffed with cured meats and roots. A single candle illuminated the corpse.</p><p>“Feel his neck,” Caleb commanded his older brother.</p><p>“You do it,” Thomas said.</p><p>“You’re always saying you should get to do more things because you’re older. Now is your chance.” Caleb smirked.</p><p>Thomas crept reluctantly toward the body and gingerly reached his hand behind the dead man’s neck.</p><p>“He’ll get stiff now,” a small voice said from a dark corner of the cellar. “He’s been dead over an hour.”</p><p>Thomas stumbled back from the body. Caleb caught him by the arm before he crashed into a shelf of glass jars.</p><p>Prudence Lewis stepped out into the faint candlelight. She stared hard at the boys.</p><p>“You scared us,” Thomas declared angrily.</p><p>“What are you doing in Reverend Parris’s root cellar?” Caleb demanded.</p><p>“What are <span class="italic">you</span> doing?” Prudence shot back.</p><p>“We are here to examine the body,” Thomas said, taking control of the situation. “Why are you here? Aren’t you scared?”</p><p>Prudence shrugged.</p><p>“Are you still bewitched?” Thomas asked skeptically.</p><p>Prudence grinned. “Of course. Haven’t you heard what Reverend Parris said? Satan has come to Salem and is using witches to do his bidding. I’m afflicted. Just not right now.”</p><p>The boys left the strange girl in the cellar, climbed back outside and went around to the front of the house to meet their father. They waited pressed against the wall until Reverend Parris had shut the door on Nathaniel, then they approached him.</p><p>“Did you find anything?” their father asked.</p><p>“Yes. A dead body in the cellar and a strange girl,” Thomas said. He went on to describe their encounter with Prudence Lewis and the dead man’s broken neck.</p><p>“Well, I think we know who we need to try the marking spell on next,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>“Who?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Prudence, you dimwit.” Thomas nudged his brother in the ribs as he spoke.</p><p>“What about the empty graves?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“We’ll have to investigate further,” Nathaniel said. “But we have to ask ourselves a question first.”</p><p>“What?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“What do the witches want?” his father replied.</p><p>Dean set down the journal and looked over at Lisa sleeping in the other bed. He got up to check on Ben in the adjoining room. He had fallen asleep in front of the television.</p><p>Dean was amazed. Not only were there Campbells in Salem during the witch trials, they were also hunters. Dean flipped through a couple more pages of the journal. In the margin Nathaniel had written the witch-marking spell:</p><blockquote><p><span class="italic">Per is vox malum ero venalicium. Per is oil malum unus ero ostendo. Per is herb malum unus ero brought continuo. They mos haud diutius non exsisto notus.</span></p></blockquote><p>Dean was sure that he could use the marking spell to identify a witch to help him. He wasn’t much closer to finding a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> but he was sure if he found a witch the book would follow.</p><h2><span id="chapter-seventeen">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-seventeen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In the morning, Dean, Lisa, and Ben headed downstairs for breakfast. As Dean was finishing his coffee, Perry, the young girl from the clam shack, appeared at his elbow. Ben was visibly delighted. Dean, not so much.</p><p>“Hey there, Captain Morgan. How are you this morning?” Dean said with a good amount of snarkiness to his voice.</p><p>Perry cast a strange sideways glance at Dean.</p><p>“I’m great, Mr. Winchester. How are you?”</p><p>Dean frowned at the mention of his last name. Had Ben told her what it was? He didn’t like strangers knowing it. Best to stay under the radar in such a small town.</p><p>Despite her earlier wariness, Lisa chatted amiably with Perry. She was warming up to the girl, Dean noted. He just nodded and pretended to read the paper. Then a little blurb under the local police blotter caught his eye:</p><blockquote><p>Salem Police have found ten abandoned vehicles in the last two weeks.</p><p>All vehicles have been impounded at Salem’s Lot and Tow.</p><p>Cars will be sold at State Auction at 11:30 a.m. today if they are not claimed.</p></blockquote><p>Ten abandoned cars in two weeks is not unusual in a big city, but Salem was relatively suburban, despite its sprawl. Dean pushed himself away from the table. He really should be pursuing the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and a witch to help him, but his hunter instincts were spiked. There was something not right about that many abandoned cars in a small town.</p><p>“Ready to go?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Actually, I’m going to go check some things out. I’ll meet you back here for lunch?” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean, we said we were going to go to the clipper ships together,” Lisa said, a hint of frustration in her voice.</p><p>“I know. I know. Why don’t we go later?”</p><p>“What are we supposed to do in the meantime?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I’ll show you around,” Perry piped up.</p><p>“Yeah sure, Perry must know the place pretty well. Let her show you the town. I’ll be back soon,” Dean said.</p><p>He kissed Lisa on the cheek and left the dining room in a rush.</p><p>He drove round the block and then stopped to change into a suit, before heading out into the morning traffic.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Three car lengths behind Dean, Sam pulled the white van into the same lane.</p><p>“This van sticks out like one of Heidi Montag’s nipples. Couldn’t we get something a little less conspicuous?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Stop complaining and follow your brother,” Samuel growled. “We need to find out what he’s up to.”</p><p>“Because of these witches, right?” Sam said.</p><p>“Exactly, these witches are bad news, they’re making monsters. Netting them will make me happy,” Samuel said. “Any questions?”</p><p>Sam had plenty of questions but kept them to himself.</p><p>Dean pulled into Salem’s Lot and Tow. A skinny kid appeared from a little shack perched on the side of the lot.</p><p>“Hey man,” Dean greeted the kid, “my sister lost her car. We think it may have been stolen. Can I take a look in your lot?”</p><p>The kid shrugged.</p><p>“You’d have to prove registration and pay the fees to get it out.”</p><p>“Or you sell it,” Dean said.</p><p>“Well, not me, it goes to the police fund actually,” the kid said.</p><p>Dean nodded. He hopped out of his car and headed toward the vehicles lined up in rows.</p><p>“What kind of car did she have?” the kid asked, falling into step beside Dean.</p><p>“I’ll recognize it when I see it. Where are the ones that were found the past couple weeks?”</p><p>The kid pointed out several cars off to one side. Dean walked over to them with purpose, as if he saw one he recognized.</p><p>The first vehicle was an old red Camry, a hand-me-down to a teenager type-thing. Dean made sure the kid had gone back into his hut, and then slid into the driver’s seat. He flipped open the glove box hoping to find the registration, but it was empty. He looked underneath the seats, ran his hands over the door panels, peered under the mats, then finally noticed something shoved into the heating vent.</p><p>Popping the grate out threw a cloud of dust into the car. Inside was a small bag tied with a red string, very like the one that had made Lisa so sick. Dean cut it open with his knife and its contents fell into his lap. He identified withered herbs, a nasty bloody chicken feather and a chicken vertebra. Either the previous owner had been a witch, or a witch had put the bag in the car to keep it off the spiritual radar.</p><p>Dean heaved himself out of that car and checked the next one. Sure enough, inside was the exact same hex bag. Perhaps Dean wasn’t going to have to look far to find a witch. But why all the abandoned cars? Dean decided to see if the police had any missing person reports.</p><p>“Duck!” Samuel shouted as he saw Dean pull his car out into traffic.</p><p>Sam and Samuel were parked right outside the lot—they hadn’t expected Dean to pull out so soon. If he had turned his head to the right, he would have seen them.</p><p><span class="italic">Fortunately Dean never bothers to look both ways when pulling into traffic,</span> Sam thought to himself.</p><p>“Where’s he going now?” Samuel growled.</p><p>Sam gunned the engine and followed his brother into the traffic.</p><p>The Salem police station was a large freestanding brick affair. Sam and Samuel parked the van across the street, and watched as Dean mounted the steps to the door.</p><p>“It looks like he’s working a case, not hunting witches,” Sam observed.</p><p>“He’s all ADHD. Believe me, he’s tracking the witches,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Why are you so sure?”</p><p>“I just know,” Samuel replied tersely.</p><p>“Fine. Forget I asked,” Sam muttered, watching the door of the police station.</p><p>Inside, Dean went to the desk clerk and asked to see the missing person reports.</p><p>“Well, most of thar ain’t missing no more,” the fat desk clerk said with a thick Massachusetts accent.</p><p>Dean nodded. “I totally get the whole Barney Frank thing now.”</p><p>“Donch get yar mening.” The clerk looked perplexed.</p><p>“Can I speak to your supervisor?” Dean asked.</p><p>The desk clerk eased himself out of his seat and led Dean to his captain, an older guy who sat behind a desk in a glass-fronted office. Dean was immediately struck by the captain’s striking resemblance to Chief Wiggum in <span class="italic">The Simpsons. Sam would love this dude,</span> he thought.</p><p>Dean badged the Captain.</p><p>“Agent McBrain. Can I have a look at your local missing person reports?” Dean demanded in his best authoritative voice.</p><p>“Don’t you guys up in DC have it in your computer?” the captain responded grumpily.</p><p>“Ah yes, the computer,” Dean replied. “Well, we do, but I wanted to check for any recent ones that you hadn’t filed yet. You’ve had ten abandoned cars found these past couple of weeks. Seems to me like you might have ten reports to go with them.”</p><p>This seemed to perturb the captain.</p><p>“No need to make everyone crazy. A couple of abandoned cars don’t seem like much trouble,” he said.</p><p>Dean smirked—this guy was hiding something.</p><p>“It <span class="italic">is</span> a problem if those cars belong to missing people.”</p><p>The Captain stood up and lumbered over to a cabinet. He pulled out a thick manila file and threw it onto his desk.</p><p>“Was goin’ to wait till the summer was over.”</p><p>Dean stared at him, incredulous.</p><p>“Really? You were going to wait until the summer was over to file the reports? Why?”</p><p>The captain shrugged.</p><p>“You can’t have dead bodies coming up outta nowhere. Scares off the tourists.”</p><p>“Wait! What dead bodies?” Dean grabbed the file from the captain’s desk. He flipped through it quickly. Inside the folder were ten individual files, each with a crime scene photo attached. Nine of the ten victims were young women. “Wait a second, all these bodies you’ve found here, in Salem?” In every one of them the cause of death was listed as asphyxiation. “How did these people actually die?”</p><p>“Don’t know. Still lookin’ into it,” the captain said.</p><p>Dean was pissed. He wasn’t really a higher rank then this guy, but if he had been, he would have throttled him for sure.</p><p>“Have you reported this to the federal authorities?” Dean demanded.</p><p>“You’re here now,” the captain pointed out. “Besides, don’t hurt no one. These here are transients.” The captain pointed to the file. “Probably gangbangers from Boston.”</p><p>“She’s about as much a gangbanger as my grandmother,” Dean said, holding up one of the crime scene pictures. It depicted a young girl with blonde hair, her face mottled with bruising. Around her neck was a peace pendant.</p><p>“Gangbangers? Really?” Dean spat. “Wait until Washington hears about this!”</p><p>He thrust the file under his arm and stomped out of the office.</p><p>As he walked away, he heard the captain again mumble something about scaring off the tourists.</p><p>Outside the police station, Dean tried to calm himself down. He needed to find out who or what had killed those people; they deserved some sort of justice.</p><p>Dean opened up his cell phone and dialed a number.</p><p>A business-like male voice answered, “FBI.”</p><p>“Yeah, this is Agent McBrain from the Boston office. You need to come down to Salem and see this shit. Ten girls dead, local police playing keep-away with the information,” Dean said brusquely.</p><p>“What’s your ID number, Agent?”</p><p>“Oh, sure, I’ll give it to you. One moment. It’s 1—“ Dean hung up the phone. Hopefully, the little ruse would piqued the FBI’s interest enough to get them to follow up and do all their CSI stuff running down the wrong people. But at least that way all the families would be notified.</p><p>Dean decided to go to the coroner’s office too, even though he knew what he’d find: each cut would be exactly the same, the same depth in the neck for maximum bloodletting. It was ritualistic killing, sacrifices. The puzzle pieces still didn’t jive though. Sacrificing usually meant that someone was trying to do a really powerful spell. But for what?</p><p>On some level Dean felt a buzz, like his brain was finally kicking into gear. He was hunting. He knew what to do. This was his world.</p><h2><span id="chapter-eighteen">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</span><a href="#chapter-eighteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean sliced through each of the small bags so their contents scattered onto the store counter and Sukie’s bare feet.</p><p>“There are nine girls and one Justin Bieber-looking kid—all dead. All with these bags found in their cars. Why are you killing these people?” Dean growled.</p><p>As Sukie opened her mouth to speak, Dean grabbed a handful of her necklaces and pulled her close.</p><p>“And don’t give me any of that ‘I don’t know nothing about being no witch’ crap,” he breathed and then let her go.</p><p>Sukie looked genuinely scared. She glanced furtively around the store as if someone might be watching.</p><p>“Listen, it’s nothing to do with me, I’m not taking part in whatever they’re doing. I just tell them what I see and I keep to myself,” she stammered.</p><p>“So you told them about me?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Among others. I didn’t know they were killing people, I swear I didn’t. I just hear stuff. I knew something big was happening. But I don’t know what.”</p><p>“What are these bags supposed to do?” Dean asked, though he was pretty sure he knew the answer.</p><p>“They’re like invisibility bags. You know, dissipates the psychic energy of the owner so a clairvoyant can’t find them,” Sukie said.</p><p>“Who’s killing them?”</p><p>“I already told you, I don’t know,” Sukie said. “And I’m always here.” She gestured at the store.</p><p>“So where else could someone get this stuff around here?”</p><p>“Nowhere, we’re the only place. But I swear I didn’t sell any of that stuff to anyone. I open and close this place every day of the week.”</p><p>Sukie seemed to be telling the truth.</p><p>“Okay, so you’re just Bush. Who’s your Karl Rove?” Dean pressed. “Is there anyone else who could take this stuff and you wouldn’t know?”</p><p>“No... I mean the only other people who have access are Connie and her girls.”</p><p>“What are we talking, here? A witch brothel? Let me guess, everyone wears a lot of black lace, Fleetwood Mac-style?” Dean smirked.</p><p>“No, she just has girls that work for her.”</p><p>“Are they all witches?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I don’t know. How many times do I have to tell you? Do you mind if I clean up now? This stuff smells.” Sukie gestured at the dust, bones, and crap before her. “If you want to know something, go ask Connie yourself.”</p><p>“One more thing. What do you need for a marking spell?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Something that marks a witch, a bad witch. Clearly not a witch-lite, like you,” he said.</p><p>“I don’t know. Do you have a spell?”</p><p>Dean took out Nathaniel Campbell’s journal and pointed to the spell written in the margin of one of the pages.</p><p>“This looks old. What’d you do? Filch this from the Peabody?”</p><p>“Something like that. Just tell me what I need.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t know. I mean I can only guess. I can’t tell you exactly. I’ve never seen this spell,” Sukie said hesitantly.</p><p>“Guess then,” Dean said.</p><p>“Well, I’d put a little Valerian root, some dragon’s blood and I guess a little sulfur. Might work. I’m not making any guarantees.” She moved round the store, gathering the stuff. She then wrapped it in a linen gris-gris bag. “You can try this.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Dean said.</p><p>“Hey, just so you know, I would never be involved with anyone that killed people. Connie is a Mean Girl, you know? I’m not like that.”</p><p>Dean nodded and left the store.</p><p>It took all his self-control not to head straight to Connie’s, crash through her front gates and rip her limb from limb. It seemed he was playing with a powerful witch, and he realized how close he had come to losing Lisa. Maybe he should call Lisa and check in, just in case...</p><p>This time he wasn’t going to get caught without something to hold over Connie. He was sure that she had something to do with the dead bodies, but he had no solid evidence. He could bring her to hunter justice—bind her up and smoke her like a Virginian ham—or turn her in to the authorities. He was going to have to get proof.</p><p>Back in his car, Dean opened the police file. He decided some old-fashioned shoe leather was called for.</p><h2><span id="chapter-nineteen">CHAPTER NINETEEN</span><a href="#chapter-nineteen" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>From their van parked down the street, Sam and Samuel spotted Dean walk out of the store.</p><p>“You wanna follow him?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“Nah, let’s go talk to the little bitch inside,” Sam proposed.</p><p>“I thought you said she didn’t know anything,” his grandfather said skeptically.</p><p>“Well, let’s just see if she’s changed her mind.”</p><p>Samuel and Sam barged through the front door of the store to find it completely empty. The girl was gone.</p><p>Samuel gestured for Sam to go to the back while he would look upstairs. Sam headed behind the counter into the dark storage room. The back door had been fixed and it was so dark in the windowless room, he could barely see his hand in front of his face.</p><p>A floorboard creaked behind him. Sam spun around and came face to face with a strange woman with harsh features.</p><p>“I’m sorry, no returns,” she said, her voice sharp and grating. She flicked her wrist and Sam was thrown up against the opposite wall. “And no, I don’t care if you’re a Campbell.”</p><p>He tried to fight the power that held him there, but the woman was too strong. He felt an unseen weight press against his chest. The women inched her hand up higher and Sam felt himself thrown up against the ceiling, he struggled to breathe as the invisible weight continued to press down on him.</p><p>“Especially without a receipt,” she said.</p><p>“Some customer service!” Samuel growled, appearing in the doorway armed with a baseball bat. He swung high toward the woman.</p><p>“Please, you’re going to use an instrument used in a game on me?” she sneered.</p><p>“No, I’m going to use this.” Samuel pulled a salt-filled sawed-off from his hip and shot just shy of the woman’s left shoulder.</p><p>“Salt? Really? You think I’m a demon?” She smirked, then stepped up to Samuel and took a large sniff. “You’ve been dead, old man.” She pushed out her hand and Samuel started to gag. “You remember not being able to breathe? That’s right, you do. And you were dead a while. So interesting... You and I will have to have a talk some time. Right now, however, I’m going to have a little—what do you call it?—barbecue.”</p><p>With another wave of her hand, a fire started on the storeroom floor in the corner. The woman stepped to the doorway and spread a powder along the floor and the doorjamb.</p><p>“It was time I cleared out my inventory anyway.”</p><p>And with that, she disappeared through the door.</p><p>Samuel struggled to move but seemed to be held fast in place in the doorway. Sam was still pinned to the ceiling, fighting for breath. The flames spread, catching on the boxes of merchandise and reaching higher.</p><p>“How is she keeping us here?” Sam choked.</p><p>“Look for a spot of blood. She got some on you somehow. Wash it off!” Samuel managed.</p><p>Sam struggled to move at all, much less look for a spot of blood. After a few seconds he managed to prise his left arm off the ceiling and found a dot of dark-red blood on the inside of his wrist.</p><p>“How am I supposed to get it off?” he called.</p><p>The fire had climbed the tower of boxes and now reached the ceiling. The flames were creeping toward his toes.</p><p>“Spit!” Samuel shouted.</p><p>Sam tried to muster saliva from his dry mouth. He spat on his wrist, and felt the invisible restraints loosen a little bit. Fighting to get his arm down by his side, he managed to wipe his wrist against his pants. He promptly fell face-first to the floor.</p><p>Without flinching, Sam sprang back onto his feet, and stamping on the spreading flames, he moved to his grandfather’s side. He grasped his left wrist and wiped off the blood he found there.</p><p>Both free they staggered into the store, which was already filled with a thick acrid smoke.</p><p>On the floor by the front window they found the girl. Her neck lay at an unnatural angle. Sam bent over and checked her pulse anyway. She was dead.</p><p>They broke through the front door and out into the street. Still coughing, eyes streaming with the effects of the smoke, they dived into their van. Sam pulled away just as the fire trucks turned the corner.</p><p>“That was some powerful witchcraft. I’ve never seen a binding spell like that before,” Sam observed.</p><p>“She must be the witch we want,” Samuel said. “It needs someone that powerful to create something purely evil. She’s strong, and I bet she’s looking to get stronger.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Witches act like a magnet; the more witches that are around, the more power they have collectively. Someone who can cast that spell, and keep us there for that long, she’s not playing around.”</p><p>“What was the blood-binding spell? I’ve seen binding spells but never one where the person could leave the room and it still stayed in place. The only thing I know that can do that is a devil’s trap,” Sam said.</p><p>“Yeah, you probably don’t want to see that spell again either,” Samuel stated dryly.</p><p>“Why? What is it?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Witch menstrual blood,” Samuel replied with just a hint of a smile.</p><p>“Agent McBrain,” Dean introduced himself, leaning over the grimy desk of the county coroner. “I need to see all the bodies that have shown up in the past two weeks. You know, the ones killed by the same Salem serial killer that everyone here seems to want to ignore.” He took back his badge and waved his hand toward the back of the basement office. “And I need to see them now.”</p><p>The elderly white-haired man behind the desk scooted out of his chair without a word and led the way to the refrigerated section of the laboratory.</p><p>“Not very chatty, are ya?” Dean observed.</p><p>“Not much to say,” the old man responded as he pulled out one of the body-sized stainless steel draws in the wall. “She was the first brought in. No identification on ‘em ‘cept a couple of tattoos.”</p><p>Job done the old dude shuffled back to his chair.</p><p>Dean examined the first young girl. A slit ran from one side of her neck to the other: it was clean, not too deep, and brutally precise. He looked for any signs of witchcraft on the body. There were no charcoal smudges or flakes of herbs, and it didn’t seem like she had been anointed for a sacrifice. But Dean noted she had defensive wounds on her hands and arms, as if she had tried to fend off her attacker.</p><p>This wasn’t a clean ritual, this kid had put up a fight.</p><p>Dean bent down slightly to get a closer look at the neck wound. As he carefully adjusted the tilt of her head, he noticed something very weird. Not only had her throat been cut—her neck was completely broken.</p><p>“This wasn’t in her report?” Dean called to the old man. The old grouch looked up, then came shuffling back toward Dean.</p><p>“What?” he asked.</p><p>“Her neck is broken. It wasn’t in your report,” Dean said. “You don’t think that’s an important thing to include? She looks like a Raggedy Ann doll!”</p><p>The old man shrugged.</p><p>Looking back at the body, Dean noticed something on the girl’s collarbone. It was a small “I Heart NYC” tattoo. Chief Wiggum was right about one thing—she was a transient. But what was she doing in Salem?</p><p>Dean checked all the other bodies. Every one of them had a broken neck. Dean sighed. Something rotten was in Salem. He had a bonafide case on his hands and that was the last thing he needed right now. All he wanted was a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and a witch and to get his brother back—was that too much to ask? Now he had ten dead bodies, and—His cell phone rang. Lisa’s number flashed insistently at him on the tiny screen—one pissed-off girlfriend.</p><p>Dean answered, “Hi babe!”</p><p>“Hey Dean. Where have you been? Is everything okay?” Lisa’s voice sounded worried.</p><p>“I’ve been, um, just around. Everything’s fine—no need to stress,” Dean said sheepishly. He really needed to come up with some good excuses for this sort of thing in advance. “How was the sightseeing?”</p><p>“It was great! I love hanging around with my pre-teen son and a girl who is coming on waaay too strong.”</p><p>“So it’s been good?” Dean said.</p><p>“No, not exactly. Are you done yet, I thought we were meeting back at the inn for lunch?”</p><p>“Okay, I just have one stop to make first,” Dean said.</p><p>“Dean—what’s this all about? Are you working a case?”</p><p>“Um, no. I don’t think so. I mean, I didn’t mean to—“</p><p>“You didn’t mean to what?” Lisa’s voice was worryingly calm.</p><p>“Nothing. Nothing,” Dean retracted quickly, sensing this was not something to get into over the phone. Especially standing in a morgue surrounded by brutally murdered young women. “I’m coming back,” he finished.</p><p>“Can you come back straight away, no stops,” Lisa said. “Ben and I are waiting for you. He wants to see the clipper ships. Today.”</p><p>“Great. Clipper ships!” Dean tried to infuse his voice with enthusiasm. “I’m on my way!” He clicked off his phone and with a last glance at the dead girls, headed for the exit. As he marched past, he noted the old coroner was paging through a Lands’ End catalog.</p><p>“Hope ya find the people that are doing this. Last time they didn’t catch anyone,” the man observed, attention still apparently on the fleece jackets in front of him.</p><p>Dean stopped in his tracks.</p><p>“What do you mean ‘last time’?”</p><p>“March of eighty-three, five dead girls. Was quite the hubbub.” The old man looked up, meeting Dean’s stare.</p><p>“March of eighty-three?” Dean repeated. Maybe it was only coincidental, but that was the same month and year that Sam was born.</p><p>Dean stepped out into the hot, hazy afternoon air. The atmosphere felt thick around him. He tried to put one foot in front of the other, but felt woozy. Both his knees failed to bend and he half-fell onto the hot cement steps. His cell phone rang again. Fumbling, Dean pulled the phone from his pocket. The screen read: SAM.</p><p>That couldn’t be. Dean stared at the number and the flashing phone sign. He hit the answer button.</p><p>“Hey Dean, it’s me, Sam. Remember? Your brother,” a voice on the other end of the line came through. Dean knew he was hallucinating. He must be hallucinating.</p><p>He opened his mouth to speak but the phone kept ringing. Dean pulled the phone away and stared intently at the screen. It now read: LISA. He took a deep breath and accepted the call.</p><p>“You’re on your way, right?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“Yeah, be there in a few.” He hung up. That was weird. He’d had dreams, but never hallucinations. He stumbled to his car, got in, and drove off.</p><p>Across the street, Sam watched Dean pull away.</p><p>“He do that a lot?” Samuel asked. “Have girly dizzy spells like that?”</p><p>“Nope. I’ve never seen him do that before,” Sam said, a slight look of recognition flickering across his face. There was a little something deep down there. A second later the grain of feeling, whatever it was, had disappeared again.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty">CHAPTER TWENTY</span><a href="#chapter-twenty" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>As Dean pulled up in the car he saw Lisa and Ben standing on the sidewalk, looking expectant. He tried to put on a poker face, but the phantom phone call from Sam had shaken him. However, he needn’t have worried about Lisa picking up on his discomfort.</p><p>“Hi, remember us, the people you’re on vacation with, <span class="italic">at your suggestion</span>?” she began. Not waiting for Dean to answer she pushed Ben toward the car. “Good, because you and Ben are going to go see the clipper ships together.” Ben jumped into the passenger seat. “Do not feed him any crap.”</p><p>“Do fried Twinkies constitute crap? How about beer dogs? I think I saw hotdogs fried in beer,” Dean said, trying to lighten the mood.</p><p>“No and no. Have fun,” Lisa said, kissing Ben and giving Dean a significant look over her son’s head, as if to say, “Remember fun?”</p><p>Dean nodded. Fun wasn’t really a concept he was comfortable with right then. He drew a breath. For Ben he would have fun. What could go wrong?</p><p>A short while later they arrived at the clipper ship that was docked on the other side of the blue-green bay. As soon as the car stopped, Ben jumped out and ran ahead.</p><p>“Hey buddy, keep your cool in check,” Dean called after him.</p><p>“Do you think there are pirates?” Ben asked as Dean caught up.</p><p>“Not sure there were pirates back in Puritan times,” Dean said. He really didn’t know—it was the kind of thing Sam would have known. “Let’s go get tickets for the tour and we can find out.” <span class="italic">Tours. Tickets. Jesus,</span> Dean thought, <span class="italic">this “fun” is turning into Mr. Rogers’ nightmare.</span></p><p>Dean noticed that there weren’t a lot of other people walking up the gangplank to the ship. It seemed as though most people—even tourists—knew to stay away from such tacky crap. The ship wasn’t even seaworthy; Dean noticed it was half-grounded on the pier. The thing wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon. That was good, however. Dean wasn’t too fond of the open water and he definitely wasn’t fond of puking on his shoes. In high school he’d taken a boat trip on the Mississippi, and the unpleasant memory came back to him as soon as he set foot on the gangplank.</p><p>Ben handed him a ticket with a Jolly Roger skull and crossbones on it.</p><p>“This is going to be great,” Ben said, leading the way to the gloomy anteroom which was the start of the tour. “And it looks like we have the whole tour to ourselves!”</p><p>“Are we late?” a voice said.</p><p>A pudgy old woman in a clinging powder-blue belted leisure suit, who clearly thought she was Super-Grandma, stepped into the room behind them. She held the hand of a little girl, about five years old, with a face like a mashed potato and a mouth rimmed with a red candy coating. The little girl’s sticky-fingered other hand grasped at Dean’s pant leg.</p><p>“Hands off the threads, Veruca Salt.” Dean cringed and stepped away.</p><p>“Dakota darling, leave the man alone,” Super-Gran said mildly.</p><p>“Ahoy there! Are ye all ready for a tour of the creakiest, creepiest ship to ever set sail the high seeeaass?” An old guy in a pirate costume leapt out from behind a plastic barrel.</p><p>“Ahhhh. Memaw!” The little girl screamed and pulled her grandmother back out toward the ticket counter.</p><p>“Guess not,” Dean observed under his breath.</p><p>“We are,” Ben said.</p><p>“Argh, grreaaat!” the old man said.</p><p>“That was a little more Tony the Tiger than Jack Sparrow,” Dean noted.</p><p>The guide gave him the evil eye.</p><p>“You can be me grommet. Would ye like that?” he asked Ben.</p><p>“Totally!” Ben said. “Can we see the Gibbet first?”</p><p>“Ye know a lot about pirates, mate,” the man said. “Just don’t get too pushy. I got a system,” he added, without the accent.</p><p>“We’re going to start foreword on the ship at the forecastle,” he continued, re-discovering the accent. “This is where the sayy-lors slept.” The pirate guide led the way as they walked toward the front of the ship.</p><p>Ben turned to Dean and shrugged.</p><p>“There’s a lot on the Internet. Pirates are cool,” he said.</p><p>After walking through a narrow hallway they entered a small dusty room with bunkbeds attached to each wall.</p><p>“‘Tis where the picaroons slept,” the man said.</p><p>“Hey dude, you don’t need to do the accent the whole time. I mean, we appreciate it and all, but, ya know, <span class="italic">not</span> necessary,” Dean told the guy. The mock-pirate regarded him for a moment with tired eyes.</p><p>“Really? ‘Cause this day sort of sucked,” he admitted.</p><p>“Yeah. Relax. Just let us wander around,” Ben said.</p><p>The guy nodded gratefully. “Okay. Just don’t tell my boss. You guys seem cool, so how about I show you some of the places that the public doesn’t get to see? I’m Teddy, by the way.” He shook hands with each of them.</p><p>“Dean and Ben,” Dean said. “Nice to meet you. Yeah, totally—show us the good stuff. Right, Ben?”</p><p>Ben nodded eagerly.</p><p>They followed Teddy to the main deck. Ben ran around pointing out where the swords were kept, and how the sails were steered. Teddy then led them down to the deck below, where the cannons were kept. It was a large nearly bow-to-stern open floor with imposing black cannons sticking out of a line of holes on each side of the ship.</p><p>“Do these work?” Ben asked, running toward one.</p><p>“Aw no,” Teddy said smiling, “these cannons have all been cemented up for decades. They used to shoot twenty-four pound balls. Boys like you would run up and down bringing gunpowder from the bottom of the ship to set them off.”</p><p>“You still have the cannonballs?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Gosh, no. They melted down whatever was found a long time ago.”</p><p>“So what’s this?” Ben asked, rolling a large cannonball across the floor.</p><p>Teddy looked surprised.</p><p>“That isn’t supposed to be there—where did you find that?”</p><p>“Yeah, I suspect we shouldn’t be here either,” Dean said, pointing out of one of the cannon holes. Teddy ran to the hole and peered out.</p><p>They were in the middle of the open sea.</p><p>“How the holy hell did that happen?” Teddy cried.</p><p>“I think he might be able to tell us,” Ben said, pointing to a tall, thin figure at the other end of the deck.</p><p>The figure limped toward them. As it moved closer, Dean could see it was a man. He appeared slightly translucent at first, but with each step he took, he became more and more solid, until he stood about twenty feet in front of them. He was dressed in a ruffled high-collar shirt with knee-high swashbuckler boots over tight trousers. A long silver sword hung from his belt.</p><p>He didn’t look happy.</p><p>“Nice shirt,” Dean observed.</p><p>The ghost turned his milky eyes toward them.</p><p>“Dean?” Ben had backed up against Dean, his eyes as wide as saucers.</p><p>“You know how you keep bugging me to teach you how to hunt?” Dean said calmly.</p><p>“Yeah,” Ben said.</p><p>“Hunt? Hunt what?” Teddy was frozen to the spot, staring at the pirate.</p><p>“Pissed off pirate ghosts,” Dean replied.</p><p>“What do you do first?” Ben asked, shuffling around behind Dean.</p><p>“Run!” Dean yelled as he pushed Ben and Teddy toward a door in the aft of the ship.</p><p>“Arrgh, ye scalliwags ain’t going to gull me!” the pirate shouted. Dean looked back to see him limping after them.</p><p>“No one is gulling anything with kids in the room,” Dean said, pulling an iron knife from his jacket and swinging at the pirate. His reach was too short, so he threw the knife at the apparition, but Captain Scalliwag was quicker than he looked and swiftly side-swiped it away with his sword.</p><p>“Through there. Now!” Dean directed Ben and Teddy toward the door.</p><p>“But ghosts aren’t real!” Teddy screamed, tripping over the threshold.</p><p>Dean pushed Ben through after Teddy, then leapt through himself. He spun around and slammed the door behind him just as the pirate’s sword blade cracked through the wood.</p><p>“Looks pretty damn real to me,” Dean said, ushering them forward into the dark of the ship.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-one">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“How did that happen? And what do we do now?” Teddy cried as he led the way down some steps.</p><p>Dean shook his head. “I don’t know. We could have passed through a portal of some sort. Could be a curse, a spell... Has anything like this ever happened before?”</p><p>“No, never,” Teddy said, “and I’ve worked here since college.”</p><p>Dean raised an eyebrow. Teddy was pushing fifty. Just then, a cacophony of harangues and the stomp of heavy boots on the deck above marched over their heads.</p><p>“Seems like there are more of them now,” Ben said.</p><p>“Is there any salt on this ship?” Dean asked Teddy.</p><p>“Should be, we use it on the gangplank during the winter,” Teddy said. “We usually keep large sacks of it in the galley.”</p><p>“Okay, well, that’s our second stop. First, where are the guns?”</p><p>“There aren’t any! We don’t keep guns on the ship.”</p><p>“Well, I would say there aren’t any pirates, but I’m pretty sure they’re here. So where would they have stored guns on a working pirate ship?” Dean said.</p><p>Teddy shrugged.</p><p>“Gunpowder room?” Ben suggested.</p><p>Teddy nodded. “Right.”</p><p>Dean punched Ben lightly on the shoulder and the boy straightened proudly.</p><p>Teddy took them down a long staircase to the very bottom of the boat.</p><p>“Through here,” he said.</p><p>“You can’t go in thar,” said a voice behind them.</p><p>The trio swung around. A craggy old sea dog was shackled beneath the stairway.</p><p>“What are you going to do about it, Golem?” Dean challenged.</p><p>“If I wasn’t chained up I would disembowel you,” the old sailor retorted.</p><p>“You look like you could use a colonoscopy yourself,” Dean said, bending down and taking out his pocket knife. He stuck it in the crevice between the floorboards and popped up one of the old planks.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Putting this poor cranky guy out of his misery,” Dean said. He stuck his arm down the hole in the floor and pulled out a human skull.</p><p>“Wha’d’ye have there?” the sea dog asked.</p><p>“Hold it, Yorick.” Sticking his hand back in the hole, Dean pulled out a moldy burlap bag. Inside was a collection of bones. Dean put the skull into the bag, then produced a small tin box of salt from a pocket, which he poured onto the bag.</p><p>“RIP old man.”</p><p>Dean lit his Zippo lighter and held the flame underneath the bag. It lit up instantly, burning bright. The old ghost started to scream.</p><p>Not waiting around to see what happened next, Dean pushed Ben through the door to the gunpowder room. Inside, the room was filled floor to ceiling with large barrels of gunpowder and an array of guns.</p><p>“This wasn’t here before,” Teddy said, amazed.</p><p>“Yeah, well, we don’t want it to be either,” Dean said. “The longer a supernatural force stays in this realm the more energy it gathers, and these ghosts are going to get all cozy in the present. So let’s get them the hell out of here. Gather all the iron pistols you can.”</p><p>“Even me?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Yeah, this <span class="italic">one</span> time, even you.” Dean handed him a flintlock pistol that was as long as Ben’s forearm.</p><p>“Pull back on this, aim, then pull the trigger,” Dean instructed. “This hammer will create a spark, but it might take a second to fire.”</p><p>“What about your <span class="italic">real</span> gun?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I didn’t know there were going to be ghost pirates,” Dean said, filling Ben’s pockets with handfuls of iron pellets. “I left it in the car.”</p><p>BANG!</p><p>The door rattled as buckshot hit the other side.</p><p>“They’re trying to shoot their way in,” Dean said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>The trio grabbed as many muskets and pistols as they could hold and climbed up the ladder at the far end of the room, emerging through a door into yet another part of the ship.</p><p>“This way!” Teddy cried, leading them through a small door.</p><p>“Um, Dean?” Ben stuttered.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“How do I use this again? Because I think I’m gonna need to,” Ben said, thumbing behind his shoulder. Dean looked down. The pirate ghosts had broken through the door and were now stomping through the artillery, gathering as they went. Now they climbing the ladder.</p><p>“Help me with these barrels!” Dean called to Teddy. They lifted three large barrels full of tar to the door, blocking it. More yells and shouts from the pirates echoed through the ship.</p><p>“Come on! We don’t have much time,” Dean said, urging the others on. “What’s the highest point on the ship? We need to get an advantage.”</p><p>“The poop deck! Follow me,” Teddy said.</p><p>Dean shook his head in disbelief.</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Teddy said. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Ben, Teddy and Dean scampered up the deck. The ship was steadily making its way into the Atlantic; only a rim of land could be seen on the horizon. Peering into the open sea, Dean felt a momentary lurch of seasickness. He took a deep breath and tried to ignore the tilting of the deck beneath his feet.</p><p>The vessel had been completely transformed into its former, seaworthy glory. The deck was full of everything one would need for a long sea voyage: rope, tar, even animals.</p><p>“How did this stuff get here?” Teddy was aghast. “This is on the National Historical Registry. They can’t bring livestock onto a national treasure,” he said, pointing to a goat that bleated at them then scampered away.</p><p>Seconds later a slew of pirates appeared. Dean counted forty confused and pissed-off buccaneers gathered at the bow of the ship, then the pirate from the gun deck stepped forward.</p><p>“I’ll not have mutiny on my ship, mate,” he called.</p><p>Dean stepped forward.</p><p>“Well, I think we’ll hang around. I think it’s time you retired from raping and pillaging anyway. How about throwing in the towel? Go down to Boca. You know, relax.”</p><p>“Why don’t ye just get off?”</p><p>“Yeah dude, that means something different now. Okay,” Dean said to Ben and Teddy, “when they advance, I want you to calmly—“</p><p>“Fire!” Teddy cried as he ineptly aimed his pistol at the ghosts.</p><p>Dean shrugged.</p><p>“Yeah, fire.” He cocked an ancient pistol and fired into the crowd of oncoming surly sailors. An iron ball exploded out of the musket and hit a peg-legged pirate square in the eye, instantly vaporizing him.</p><p>“You got him!” Teddy said.</p><p>“He’ll be back, and more pissed off. This is just to buy us some time,” Dean said, letting off a two-handed barrage of gunfire. Another ghost vaporized, then a couple of seconds later re-materialized, stumbling, in the same place. “Ben, we need salt. Go find the galley!”</p><p>Ben scampered off as Teddy and Dean held the motley crew of pirates at bay. A few minutes later he returned, dragging a large sack of rock salt.</p><p>“Got it!” he called.</p><p>Dean cut open the sack and grabbed it at the base. He heaved a large semi-circle of salt around them. The ghost who seemed to be the captain of the motley crew charged the salt line but couldn’t cross it.</p><p>“I’ll get ye,” he growled.</p><p>“Okay, Captain Crunch, keep your breeches on.” Dean refilled his gun and shot him between the eyes. The ghost vaporized but then re-materialized. Teddy took a swing at him with a iron loading rod. It split the ghost in two. But just for a moment.</p><p>“Ah, Dean!” Ben cried.</p><p>A pirate had climbed up the outside of the ship and was now steadily forcing Ben to walk along the plank on the stern of the ship. Dean took aim at the pirate’s back but Ben was directly behind him—he couldn’t take a shot without hitting Ben too.</p><p>“Ben, stay calm. Aim your pistol at him and shoot!” Dean directed.</p><p>“It’s jammed!” the boy called. Tears were streaming down Ben’s cheeks.</p><p>“Throw it at him!” Dean yelled.</p><p>Ben hefted his gun at the ghost, but the grizzly pirate caught it deftly and instead aimed it at Ben.</p><p>“Duck!” Dean cried as he aimed and shot at the ghost. Ben hit the plank as the shot ripped through the ghost. Dean jumped to the plank and pulled Ben up and behind him.</p><p>The ghost quickly came back.</p><p>“Teddy! Shoot!” Dean screamed.</p><p>Teddy rotated a cannon, then lit the fuse. The ball rumbled out of the opening and arced toward the ghost. It obliterated the specter and punched through the stern of the boat.</p><p>“We have to turn this ship around. Teddy can you do that?” Dean asked.</p><p>“I can try,” Teddy replied. He jumped over the salt line, caught a hanging rope and in a move that would have made Indiana Jones proud, swung to the other side of the deck, landing at the wheel.</p><p>“Ben, see that little dinghy right there?” Dean pointed. “Start lowering it down. When Teddy gets the ship turned around, you set it in the water and get in. You understand?”</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Ben asked.</p><p>“I’m going to make sure these pirates don’t reach land,” Dean said determinedly. He spotted a thick length of rope. Simultaneously shooting at ghosts, he dragged the rope over to a large barrel of tar, dunked in the entire rope, some two-hundred pounds’ worth, then threw it over the side of the ship.</p><p>He called out to Ben, “Ben, grab the other end of the rope and don’t let go. Okay?”</p><p>Ben waved as he fought to lower the dinghy on a pulley.</p><p>Meanwhile, Teddy pulled at the wheel and the ship began to turn in a big lazy curve.</p><p>The pirates all shot to one side of the deck, giving them temporary relief from attack.</p><p>Dean took the opportunity to throw salt mixed with gun powder in lines across the deck. Then he carefully lit each line. In moments an enormous crosshatch of fire spread across the surface of the ship.</p><p>Dean raced across the deck to help Teddy at the wheel. Perched on a turret, struggling against the ancient ring of wood, Teddy heroically stood fast and hung on, making sure the ship made a full turn. Dean kicked and shot at oncoming ghosts. A long-haired pirate attacked and Dean beheaded him with an iron sword. The pirate vaporized then reappeared just three feet away.</p><p>“Come closer, I want to rip your heart out an’ eat it for me dinner,” Hairy declared.</p><p>“Sorry, I’m not free for lunch, Long John Silver,” Dean said, swinging the iron sword again and knocking the ghost clear onto the other side of a burning salt line. Dean turned back toward the turret just as another pirate climbed over a railing and snuck up behind Teddy.</p><p>“Teddy, watch out!” Dean shouted.</p><p>The pirate swung his sword.</p><p>It cut straight through Teddy’s torso.</p><p>Teddy turned around and gasped. The ghost jumped onto him and stuck his hand inside his chest. Teddy’s eyes saucered wide, he clutched at his heart, then fell forward onto the wheel.</p><p>The ship pitched right, debris tumbled off the deck, a couple of ghosts plunged into the churning water. Dean raised his gun and shot at Teddy’s killer. The pirate vaporized, then came back. Dean shot at him again and raced to Teddy’s side. He was dead. <span class="italic">Crap, poor guy.</span> He glanced quickly over his shoulder to see if Ben had witnessed Teddy’s violent end. <span class="italic">Better if the boy doesn’t know what happened.</span></p><p>Dean took another length of rope and tied the wheel of the ship so it was headed straight toward shore. He jumped onto the railing, shoved the gun in the waistband of his jeans, and pulled a hanging piece of rope close.</p><p>“Anything to do with Tarzan—always a bad idea,” he muttered. He held on tight and heaved himself off the railing. The rope arced low over the length of the deck like a pendulum. Dean kicked and stabbed a couple of pirates as they clamored and grasped at his heels. At the top of the trajectory, Dean jumped off and pushed Ben into the dinghy.</p><p>“Tour’s over.”</p><p>Dean grabbed the tar-coated rope, and took a bag of gunpowder out of his pocket. He plastered it onto the end of the rope and lit it with his Zippo.</p><p>“Cut the rope!”</p><p>Ben produced a machete and cut the pulley rope. The dinghy swung out and hung for a second, then dropped harshly into the water.</p><p>The first explosion bloomed from the deck, rocketing flaming debris over the sides of the ship toward the dinghy.</p><p>“Row, row hard!” Dean urged.</p><p>Ben and Dean pulled at the oars, straining against the pull of the ship as it surged forward. They were caught in its wake. The two vessels were quickly approaching shore. But as furiously as Ben and Dean tried to row away from the ship, its thrust made it impossible to maneuver out of its grasp.</p><p>“Where’s Teddy?” Ben shouted over the roar of the explosions.</p><p>“He’s fine,” Dean replied, looking sadly back at the ship. “Don’t worry about him.” Ben was too breathless from rowing to press him further.</p><p>The top deck caught fire as a series of smaller explosions ripped tank-sized holes in the side of the ship. Dean and Ben bobbed alongside the flaming fireball.</p><p>“We need to push ourselves away from the ship,” Dean called.</p><p>Ben nodded. “We need a cannon or something.”</p><p>Dean thought a moment. He looked around them, they were surrounded by debris bobbing in the churning water. What could he use?</p><p>“Help me get this thing in the boat,” Dean instructed. He and Ben leaned over the side of the small craft, careful not to let it capsize, and pulled a cracked nine-foot-long piece of mast from the water.</p><p>Another explosion ripped through the back of the ship, shooting the cast-iron stove into the water. Seeing a solution, Dean paddled and managed to get to the pipe which let out the smoke. He pried it off the sinking stove and grabbed a floating plank of wood.</p><p>“We need to nail this plank onto the bottom of this pipe. Find nails, whatever you can,” Dean said.</p><p>As the ship sped toward the shore, Dean and Ben struggled to stay afloat as they fished pieces of debris out of the water and using the handle of Ben’s machete managed to nail the plank onto the pipe. Dean shoved a bag of gunpowder down the end of the pipe and then, with difficulty, positioned the pipe against the bow of the dinghy and the plank that ran across as a second seat. They heaved the mast into the pipe, and turned the dinghy’s bow toward the ship.</p><p>“Hold onto the stern, Ben. As soon as you feel the boat shoot forward—you kick!”</p><p>“Kick? Why?”</p><p>“‘Cause this puppy is going to tear this thing apart like a chew toy,” Dean warned. He lit a piece of tarred rope and dropped it into the pipe. “Hold tight!”</p><p>The pipe sizzled and cracked, then the gunpowder shot the mast out of the pipe. The mast was so long that it hit the ship while still in contact with the pipe. The dinghy shot forward, freeing itself from the wake of the ship. The explosion ripped the dinghy’s stern off and Dean and Ben’s legs dipped into the cold water. They both gasped.</p><p>“Kick!” Dean yelled.</p><p>They kicked the front half of the dinghy away from the ship. The sails were aflame, and the top of the ship was charring to black. The floating inferno narrowly missed a leisure tour boat. As the water calmed, closer to shore, the ship took a slow curve, as if it was trying to steer itself back to its old position. The flaming mass of wood and rope plowed into the old dock, throwing up debris onto the parking lot and a crowd of gaping tourists.</p><p>A fireball burst from the ship, instantly burning up the remaining ghosts on board. The inferno washed over the old wooden pier, setting alight a car which had the misfortune of being parked in the closest handicap space.</p><p>Fire trucks zoomed in from all corners of the parking lot. A crowd gathered behind them.</p><p>Dean and Ben continued to kick toward the shore. As the water became shallower, Dean pushed himself off the dinghy and pulled it onto the sandy beach. He paused for a moment, breathing deeply.</p><p>“Dean! Ben!” He heard Lisa scream from the rocks above the beach.</p><p>Dean helped Ben out of the water and the two of them climbed over the rocks; sandy, wet, and exhausted.</p><p>Lisa grasped Ben, hugging him despite the soaking, dirty state of him.</p><p>“What happened? You were supposed to go on a quiet boat tour—while docked!” Lisa said, looking incredulously at the damage.</p><p>“There were ghosts, Mom. Pirate ghosts,” Ben said. “But we got them—we burned them and shot them. It was very cool.”</p><p>Lisa looked at Dean.</p><p>“Did he touch a gun?”</p><p>“Lis, that’s not the point. This was a ‘three-hour tour’ from hell,” Dean responded. “Besides, he wasn’t half bad with a flintlock.” He ruffled Ben’s hair.</p><p>“He touched a gun!” Lisa’s eyes were wide and angry. “I said no guns. Ever.”</p><p>“You know, Lisa, we could stand around here and talk this over, but I think maybe the police are going to want to... Maybe we should leave.”</p><p>“Why does destruction follow you wherever you go?” she asked despairingly.</p><p>“This really wasn’t my fault. Right, Ben?” Dean slung his arm around Ben’s shoulder. “The pirates came after us first.”</p><p>“Why would pirates come after you?” Lisa said. “What did you do to them?”</p><p>“They’re ghosts, Lisa, it doesn’t really work that way,” Dean said, looking away toward the rapidly growing crowd of onlookers.</p><p>“Hey Dean, where’s Teddy? Is he still on the ship?” Ben looked anxiously at the burned remains of the pirate vessel.</p><p>Dean ran a hand through his hair. No way could he tell the kid what had really happened. He’d been through enough that day already.</p><p>“He’s all right. I think he’s over there.” Dean pointed vaguely across the parking lot.</p><p>Then he spotted her. Across the parking lot, a tall, tight-faced woman in a dark coat, staring straight at them.</p><p>“Well, how does it work?” Lisa said, trying to get Dean’s attention. “Dean?”</p><p>The woman continued to stare at Dean over the commotion in the parking lot. He’d never seen her before, but there was something about her that was both familiar and threatening.</p><p>“Dean? Dean, I’m talking to you. Is there something I should know about? Are more ghosts going to come after us?”</p><p>Dean took hold of Lisa’s shoulders and stared into her eyes.</p><p>“No. I promise. They won’t,” he said, firmly. “But you have to trust me and do what I tell you: Go back to the hotel and don’t open the door to <span class="italic">anybody.</span> Okay?”</p><p>“Dean, you’re scaring me. What is going on?” Lisa looked back at him, eyes wide.</p><p>“Can I be that guy and say I’ll explain later?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You know in the movies that never works out,” Lisa replied.</p><p>“I know. But you have to trust me on this. Everything is going to be fine. I came here for something, but I just think I stepped into something bigger.”</p><p>“So unlike you.” Lisa managed to crack a slight smile. “Go. We’ll be fine.”</p><p>Lisa hugged Ben close, as if reassuring herself that he was still with her and all in one piece. Dean nodded then swung around and beelined toward the crowd, but the woman was nowhere to be seen. He fumbled for his car keys in the pocket of his wet jeans. Miraculously, they were still there. He jumped into the car and sped off.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Fifteen minutes later Dean pulled up in front of the charred remains of Connie’s Curios and Conversations. A policeman and a county coroner were pushing a white body bag into the back of a van.</p><p>Dean jumped out of the car and ran up to them.</p><p>“Hey dude, who is that?” he asked.</p><p>“Poor girl who worked there. Burned up like a crisp. Don’t know why she didn’t even try to get out,” the county coroner replied, slamming the door shut.</p><p>Dean stared after the van as it chugged away. He got back in his car, flipped a bitch, and headed north to Connie Hennrick’s place.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-two">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean was reeling from the death of Sukie. Apart from the incident with the baseball bat, the kid had been harmless enough. <span class="italic">I guess it proves you can’t “dabble” in witchcraft. Dangerous shit like that always catches up with you eventually.</span> But Dean wished he’d been able to save Sukie. She hadn’t deserved to die.</p><p>Sukie’s death, combined with his <span class="italic">Titanic</span> moment and Teddy’s death, sent Dean into an emotional spiral. He had certainly stumbled onto a case, something big which needed his attention. He still wanted to find a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> to raise Sam, but it was clear that the brutal killings, the hex bags, and the pirate ghosts, that something was going on and someone was trying to stop him from finding out what it was.</p><p>Dean headed north looking for the Hennrick farm, following signs to Ipswich Road. The road curved through woods. After a mile or two the trees bent over the blacktop, cutting out the gray sky. Dean slowed at a large iron gate with a decorative “H” mounted onto the face. He pulled up twenty meters further on and stopped. Dean took out Nathaniel’s journal and started to read.</p><p>Nathaniel and his boys set out the next day to visit the Widow Faulkner. Nathaniel wanted to pay his respects as she’d lost a daughter. But his curiosity had also been piqued when Hannah mentioned that Abigail Faulkner was in a quilting circle with Reverend Parris’s daughter, the girl who had been bewitched for two weeks. It seemed strange that almost to the day that the bewitching started, Abigail’s body had been found. Did the two events have anything to do with one another?</p><p>Rose Mary wrapped up a loaf of freshly baked bread, and handed it to Nathaniel to put in his pack. It was widely known that since John Faulkner had died five years ago, his widow had struggled to feed her children and keep her small farm. Taking a little something for the family to eat was an appropriate gesture, especially after the loss of a child. At least that was Nathaniel’s reasoning as he, Caleb, and Thomas set out.</p><p>What they reached the widow’s homestead, they were surprised to find, rather than a rundown and poverty-stricken house, a prosperous little residence. The previously empty barn held two horses and two cows, quite a luxury in Salem.</p><p>Nathaniel rapped on the door. Widow Faulkner invited them into, not a cold unforgiving room, but a warm and cozy interior. There was food on the table and what smelled to Nathaniel like venison stew bubbling away on the hearth. That season had been particularly bad for hunting and someone would have had to be a very fortunate to bring home a catch of fresh deer.</p><p>Nathaniel formally introduced the boys to the widow. He passed on Rose Mary’s condolences and added that he and the boys would be happy to do anything around the house if the family needed help. She declined politely, explaining that she was comfortable and had plenty of food for her and her two remaining children.</p><p>“And how are the twins? I seem to recall they have some difficulty walking,” Nathaniel enquired.</p><p>“They are quite fine, thank you. Here they come now,” the widow said, straightening in her chair.</p><p>Two identical boys about Caleb’s age sprinted through the door and into the common room where the Campbells sat. Both looked healthy and ruddy, with not a sign of a limp between them. Whatever affliction had caused their lameness was completely gone.</p><p>Nathaniel wondered how a widow could go so quickly from abject poverty to living comfortably.</p><p>“Widow Faulkner, I’m so very sorry about the loss of your daughter,” Nathaniel said earnestly, watching the woman’s reaction.</p><p>“The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. Isn’t that what Reverend Parris says?” she replied evenly.</p><p>“Indeed. You are correct. It seems that you want for nothing, however,” Nathaniel said, gesturing at the evidence of comfort around them.</p><p>“Except my daughter. I would do anything to have my daughter back,” the widow said.</p><p>“Of course. Tell me, did she have very many friends? Perhaps she was acquainted with Reverend Parris’s daughter?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>“No, not at all. On Sundays and Thursday evening prayers, perhaps they spoke. But they were by no means friends.”</p><p>This was not the response Nathaniel had expected. He nodded solemnly, repeated his regrets, and indicated to Thomas and Caleb that it was time to leave.</p><p>Once outside, Nathaniel shook his head. He was confused. He had been sure the bewitched girls would have some link to Abigail’s death.</p><p>As Nathaniel mounted his horse, the widow appeared at her door. She gestured to Nathaniel.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, there is one more thing,” she said.</p><p>“What’s that?” asked Nathaniel.</p><p>“I loved my daughter, but I didn’t agree with some of the company she kept.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>The widow looked around nervously, even though no one was around.</p><p>“Like the Ball family,” she said finally. With that she nodded politely and went back inside.</p><p>Nathaniel looked at his two boys.</p><p>“Feel like a visit to Constance Ball’s house? This may be a link to those unearthed graves you saw on her property.”</p><p>Caleb and Thomas nodded. Constance Ball’s daughters were notorious throughout Salem Village. They never seemed to want to talk to anyone except each other, and they were also all strikingly beautiful.</p><p>The Ball residence was located not far from the Campbell family home, hence Thomas and Caleb occasionally cutting across their land, though they knew they shouldn’t. The house was an impressive brick affair, its building material alone setting it apart from most of the nearby residences, which were clapboard. The one singular thing about the Balls everyone in Salem knew was that ever since anyone could remember, they had lived on that land, and in that house.</p><p>“Do you think Constance Ball has something to do with Abigail’s death?” Thomas asked as he trotted alongside his father.</p><p>“I guess we will find out,” Nathaniel said. “Do you know what to do once we are invited inside?”</p><p>The boys nodded. This was exactly the kind of situation Nathaniel had trained them for. They had sat up for long nights in freezing weather staking out potential vampire nests. They had seen their share of demon possessions. But Nathaniel also taught them how to be polite enough to be invited into a home, which was sometimes half the battle.</p><p>By the time the Campbells reached Constance Ball’s house, a great wind had whipped up. Snow blew across the open fields, blinding them as they approached. Nathaniel tied up his horse and they ascended the steps. The door knocker was as big as Caleb’s head. Thomas pried it from the door and let it fall against its brass base. Even over the wind the CLACK! could be heard echoing through the building.</p><p>A minute or two later a large man in black pants and jacket, the kind that buttoned all the way to the collar, opened the door, revealing a grand entranceway and a sweeping staircase. Nathaniel introduced himself and asked to be let in. The man led Nathaniel and the boys into a large living area to the right of the grand hallway.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb had never been in such a big house. Once inside, they found places next to the large roaring fire as they waited for the lady of the house. Nathaniel immediately recognized a couple of curious artifacts around the room, most notably a small worn-looking book perched on a podium. He peered at the first page—it was written entirely in Latin.</p><p>He heard the boys gasp as a long index finger suddenly closed the book in his face. Nathaniel looked up and found himself face to face with Constance Ball. She was a handsome woman, always well-coiffed, almost in a Renaissance style, but specifically overdressed for a colonial woman.</p><p>“May I help you?” she asked.</p><p>“Madam Ball, I’m Nathaniel Campbell and these are my sons, Caleb and Thomas.” The boys bowed politely.</p><p>“I know who you are,” she said. “Your property abuts mine. Is there a problem? Did one of my girls trespass?”</p><p>“No, not at all. Though perhaps you wouldn’t mind if I spoke with your daughters?”</p><p>“What for?” Constance asked.</p><p>“I’d like to know if they were acquainted with Abigail Faulkner,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>Constance affected a frown of deep thought.</p><p>“I’m quite sure I don’t know the name,” she said after a moment. She sat down in a straight-backed chair and glared coldly at Nathaniel.</p><p>“That’s strange,” Nathaniel said. “For her mother, Widow Faulkner, said that her daughter knew you and your girls.”</p><p>“I’m not sure what you are aiming at,” Constance said.</p><p>“You do know that little Abigail Faulkner is dead?” Nathaniel asked.</p><p>Constance paused before replying.</p><p>“No, I’m not sure that I did. Exactly what are you getting at, Mr. Campbell?”</p><p>During the exchange, Thomas and Caleb had crept behind Constance’s chair. Caleb pulled a small bag from his pocket and tried to place it under her seat. Constance whirled around instantly, startling the boy.</p><p>“What are you doing down there, you little monkey?” she demanded.</p><p>Nathaniel stepped in.</p><p>“I’m sorry, he’s a strange boy. Caleb, come here.” Caleb did as he was told and took his place beside his father.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, I’ve had just enough of your tomfoolery. You can leave now,” Constance declared, rising from her chair.</p><p>“I don’t think you understand,” Nathaniel replied.</p><p>“Rathburn,” she called. “Show these gentlemen out.” The large man materialized in the doorway as though he had been listening behind it all along. He marched across the room and grasped Nathanial by the arm.</p><p>Nathaniel pulled his arm away from Rathburn’s vice-like grip.</p><p><span class="italic">“Per is vox malum ero venalicium. Per is oil malum unus ero ostendo.”</span> Nathaniel started to chant the Latin marking spell.</p><p>Constance smiled serenely.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, if you wanted to know if I was a witch, why didn’t you just ask?” With a casual flick of her wrist, Caleb went flying against the bookcases.</p><p>“Daadd!” Caleb’s small body twisted up against the wall.</p><p>Nathaniel unsheathed the knife hidden beneath his coat.</p><p>“You think you can hurt me with that pig sticker? Mr. Campbell, you don’t know me or what I’m capable of.” She whirled her arm around and the room became filled with a gale as powerful as the one outside.</p><p>Constance turned to face Nathaniel. Another small hand gesture sent him flying across the room.</p><p>Thomas tried to tackle Constance, but she flipped him end over end into the corner.</p><p>“I’ll not be attacked in my own home, you silly fool.” Constance waved her hand again. The fire leaped out of the fireplace and began to swirl in a tornado up toward the ceiling. <span class="italic">“Eugae satan imus focales olle obligamus tu adque subsidium me clades mi trespassers,”</span> Constance shouted.</p><p>The fire burned closer and closer to Thomas, who lay in a heap on the floor, unconscious.</p><p>“Thomas! Wake up!” Caleb shouted.</p><p>“Oh, isn’t that curious, your eldest seems to have lost his senses. Just like his father,” Constance sneered. She stood regal as the fiery tornado swirled around her. “Tell me, Nathaniel, why would you bring your children here? Why put them in danger? Oh, I know why—you’re a hunter. All hunters are the same. Blow-hards who think they have the right to judge everyone but themselves. Let me tell you something,” she leaned her face close to Nathaniel’s, her breath was icy cold on his face, “we came here, same as you, for a new life. The New World is for everyone, not just those with their nose in a Bible.”</p><p>“You killed Abigail Faulkner, an innocent young girl,” Nathaniel spat back at her.</p><p>Constance shrugged and turned away from him.</p><p>“So what if I did. Sometimes the weak have to be punished for insubordination.”</p><p>“Salem won’t stand for this,” Nathaniel yelled at her back.</p><p>“Please, Salem is doing a good job of extinguishing all rational thought. Don’t you think, girls?” Constance turned to address five young women standing in the doorway. The flames reflected in their very dark eyes.</p><p>Constance turned back around and stared coldly at Nathaniel.</p><p>“Let’s get one thing straight, Mr Campbell: I could kill you, it would be as easy as this.” She clicked her fingers. “If you cross me again, your children will be orphans. I’ll make sure of that.” She raised her hand up, hovering near Nathaniel face. “And next time, I will not be so merciful.”</p><p>Three large deep scratches appeared across Nathaniel’s cheek, sending blood dribbling down his chin onto his coat.</p><p>“I can control many things,” she hissed. “Nowhere in Salem is safe. Girls, show the Campbells the way out.”</p><p>The five girls gathered in a circle, raised up their hands, and with a flick of their wrists Nathaniel, Thomas, and Caleb blew through the glass-paned glass windows and landed on the snow outside. The gale wrapped around them. Thomas was still unconscious as Nathaniel lifted him onto the horse and they limped away.</p><p>Rose Mary opened the door as Nathaniel, Thomas, and Caleb approached the house.</p><p>“What on earth?” she cried. “Hannah, go get the herbs and oils.”</p><p>Nathaniel gently laid Thomas on the table. Caleb tugged off his brother’s boots, and Hannah pressed a warm compress of medicinal plants against Thomas’s temple.</p><p>“What happened?” Rose Mary asked, leaning over her son.</p><p>“Constance Ball attacked us,” Caleb replied.</p><p>“She’s a full-fledged witch, she <span class="italic">and</span> her daughters,” Nathaniel explained. “As Salem sends innocent old women to the gallows, the real witches are left alone.”</p><p>“But why did they attack you?” Rose Mary asked.</p><p>“Because I asked her about Abigail Faulkner. Constance killed her. I just don’t know why.” Nathaniel sat down in a chair near the fire and kicked off his boots.</p><p>Thomas stirred and opened his eyes then sat up with a moan holding his head.</p><p>“I’m sure that woman is up to no good,” Nathaniel continued. “She has a Latin spell book. I think it’s a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.”</span></p><p>“What would she be doing with that?” Hannah asked.</p><p>“I’ve only seen one once. It’s filled with all sorts of ways for binding demons.” Nathaniel indicated his cheek. “The book has many powerful spells. All of them dangerous and all of them evil.”</p><p>“Like what?” Caleb said.</p><p>“Unless I can read it, I have no way of knowing,” Nathaniel said. “But take great care in everything you do now, in town or wherever someone can see you. Constance is up to something and the atmosphere in town is like a dam about to break.”</p><p>“What about the graves?” Caleb asked. “What do those have to do with it?”</p><p>Nathaniel shook his head with frustration. He wasn’t sure what Constance’s plan was, but he knew that it must tie in with Abigail Faulkner’s death, and the unearthed graves.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-three">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean closed Nathaniel’s journal. He was slowly putting it together. Connie and Constance, the old house off Ipswich Road. Could they be one and the same? Could she still be alive, hundreds of years later?</p><p>From the back of the car, he pulled out one of the machetes hidden in the spare tire wheel well and cut down some of the low hanging branches from nearby trees. He piled those on top of the car for cover and then walked back toward the heavily padlocked gate.</p><p>In the distance behind the gate a large brick house loomed tall, surrounded by empty expanses of field on both sides. A high stone wall extended all around the property.</p><p>“Guess I’m not going to be invited in,” Dean said to himself as he hoisted himself onto the flat part of the wall.</p><p>Dean felt something give under his hand. He looked down. Stuck into a crevice in the rock and mortar was a weathered-looking hex bag wrapped in red string—a protection gris-gris bag. He was in the right place.</p><p>Dean jumped down the other side of the wall, feeling the soft earth sink under his shoes. It was going to be difficult to sneak up on the house with all that open space around it. Dean surveyed the area and decided to enter from the back. He snuck around the perimeter of the fields, keeping hidden in the tree line.</p><p>Once he was behind the house, he made his way up the slope and hid behind a barn. From what he could see, five young girls were working on the farm. One was pulling weeds in a what looked like a kitchen garden, another was leading a cow across a pasture. It looked idyllic, if not really old-fashioned.</p><p>Dean heard the titter of voices coming from within the barn and peeked in through the wavy glass panes to see two women grooming a horse.</p><p><span class="italic">This is either going to turn into the hottest Puritan porn I’ve ever seen, or these bitches are witches,</span> he thought.</p><p>He turned his head and—</p><p>WHACKKK!</p><p>He was twisted round and thrown up against the solid wooden surface of the barn. A heavy weight pressed up against his chest, but the brawny field hand in front of him wasn’t even touching him.</p><p>“Hey, sorry, man. Lost my way? Do you give pony rides here?” Dean said.</p><p>The man didn’t answer. Instead, he flicked his wrist and Dean dropped to the ground. Silently, he gestured that Dean should walk toward the house.</p><p>Once inside, Dean was pushed into a chair next to a large stone fireplace. Heavy curtains were drawn across floor-to-ceiling windows; so it was impossible to see outside.</p><p>Moments later a middle-aged woman walked into the room. Dean immediately recognized the woman who had been staring at him in the parking lot. Closer up, Dean could see she had a high-browed forehead and a face set with a wide mouth.</p><p>“Do you often trespass on private property?” she asked in a crackling, accented voice with a slight European lilt to it.</p><p>“Angela Lansbury. Wow, I’m a big fan,” Dean said sarcastically, springing from his seat.</p><p>The big guy in the corner flicked his wrist again and Dean was thrown back into his chair.</p><p>“Don’t worry big guy, I’m not going anywhere. You and I can go out back and milk a cow together. Would you like that?” Dean grinned.</p><p>“What do you want?” the woman asked. She lowered herself into a seat opposite Dean and stared coldly into his eyes.</p><p>“Well, Constance—I’m assuming you’re Constance Hennrick, Connie of Connie’s Curios. Can I call you Connie? Under normal circumstances, Connie, I would cut your throat with a silver knife, chant a little bit then make sure you were buried well and good in four different places. Considering you tried to kill my girlfriend and drown me and her kid, I think that would be letting you off easy,” Dean said. “Though I might have spared a couple of those hotties you have outside if they behaved themselves. It’s hard to find good help these days.”</p><p>“Effective salutation,” Connie said. “Sadly, I’ve lost patience.”</p><p>She got up and gestured to the heavy in the corner.</p><p>“Wait,” Dean said. “About this afternoon, you don’t deny it, so I assume it was you. You have to be pretty powerful to resurrect an entire ship’s worth of pirates.”</p><p>Constance simply shrugged.</p><p>“Then you are exactly the person I’ve been searching for,” Dean said.</p><p>“And why is that?” she said.</p><p>“Because I need your help.”</p><p>“I really don’t have time for little piglets like you.” She gestured again, and the heavy strode over and pulled Dean from his chair.</p><p>“Wait, wait. Listen,” Dean said, “I need a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> I need to raise someone who is caught in a very powerful cage.”</p><p>“You wouldn’t know what to do with a <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> if you had one,” she said.</p><p>“No, you’re right. That’s why I need you,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s an impossibility. A book like that has powers beyond your paltry imagination. I am quite sure you don’t have the stomach for it.”</p><p>“So you have one?” Dean persisted.</p><p>“If I did, I wouldn’t let you anywhere near it. Besides, what on earth makes you think I would help you?” she asked.</p><p>“Not a thing. Only that I am pleading with someone that under normal circumstances I would gank in an instant,” Dean replied.</p><p>“Sorry, I don’t work for peasants, much less the likes of <span class="italic">you</span> and <span class="italic">your kind,”</span> Connie said.</p><p>With that she left the room and the brawny guy dragged Dean out of the chair by his collar, pulled him through the house, out of the front door and down the driveway.</p><p>“Hey, Paul Bunyan, lay off the jacket!” Dean said, gasping for breath.</p><p>The guy opened the gate and threw Dean out into the road. He landed on a double yellow line, some twenty feet away from the driveway entrance. It was quite a throw.</p><p>Dean got up and dusted himself off. Things were not going well.</p><p>He limped back to his car, bruised and battered and still a bit damp from his pirate adventure.</p><p>On the passenger seat the case files he had taken from Chief Wiggum had been jostled by the drive, fanning out all the pictures. Dean picked up a particularly brutal photo of a girl in a BU sweatshirt. He was torn. There was a case here.</p><p>All the gris-gris bags in the victims’ cars were certainly the work of witches, probably that of Connie and her girls.</p><p>Dean shook his head at his bad luck. He was just kidding himself. There was no other explanation—Connie had to be the Constance from Nathaniel’s journal. And to make matters worse she was up to something very, very bad. Again.</p><p><span class="italic">It figures that the one person I need help from could have killed ten people.</span> Dean shook it off and decided to go back to the hotel. He should make sure Lisa and Ben were okay.</p><p>Just then two large black Escalades slid out of Connie’s driveway and turned south. Dean’s car was still camouflaged by tree branches so he was pretty sure they didn’t see him. Dean waited until they had disappeared from view, then he turned his car around and followed.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-four">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and his grandfather sat in the parked van on the side of the road hidden around a curve.</p><p>“We’re going to lose them,” Sam said.</p><p>“Just wait,” Samuel responded sternly. They sat silently for a few moments. “Okay, now go. Just hang back a little bit.”</p><p>“Not my first rodeo, gramps,” Sam muttered as he started the vehicle.</p><p>As they made their way into the glowing suburban traffic outside Salem, they watched the two Escalades ahead of them pull into a shopping mall parking lot with Dean’s CRV not far behind. It was about nine p.m. and there were very few cars left in the lot, only a few stragglers, laden with shopping bags, were making their way out of the mall. A large megalith sign, ‘Books ‘n’ Novels,’ clung to the stucco side of the mall. Inside Sam could make out the employees shutting off the lights and locking the doors. The Escalades were parked in the two spaces closest to the bookstore doors.</p><p>Dean parked on the outskirts of the lot, away from the lights. He reached for his flask. The Jack Daniels went down easy and took the edge off the crazy day. Dean wasn’t quite sure why Connie and the girls would need to make a bookstore run at nine at night. Chances were it wasn’t because they were after the next <span class="italic">Twilight</span> novel.</p><p>Sam and Samuel waited in the white van on the other side of the lot, far away from the store.</p><p>“What do you think they’re doing?” Sam asked.</p><p>“No idea, but I don’t think it’s to pick up Ad Hoc,” his grandfather replied.</p><p>Sam raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Thomas Keller’s new... Forget it. I’m a fan is all,” Samuel said.</p><p>“You’re a fan of celebrity chefs?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Do you know how hard it is to get a restaurant up and running?” Samuel asked with sincerity. “He’s a genius.”</p><p>The last bank of lights in the store was shut off. Dean watched as a mousy-looking girl emerged from the double glass doors holding a large key ring. She shoved the key in the lock and fiddled with it, twisting and turning it in an increasingly desperate attempt to lock up the store.</p><p>A figure slipped out of the back door of one of the Escalades and approached her. Dean perked up as he clocked the gorgeous blonde girl in boots and a short jean skirt.</p><p>“Need some help?” she asked the mouse, who was beginning to visibly panic. The parking lot was silent as a grave. When he wound down his window, Dean was just about able to hear the exchange.</p><p>“No, thanks,” the other girl replied, without looking up. “It’s just these stupid keys. My manager needed to leave early and—“</p><p>In an instant the blonde elbowed her in the face. A look of surprise and hurt washed over the mousey girl’s features, and a line of blood dribbled out the corner of her mouth. She tried to raise her hand in a futile attempt to block another parry, but she was far too slow. The other girl punched her in the stomach. She dropped the keys and doubled over, then stumbled, losing her balance. Her assailant was behind her in an instant, effortlessly catching her by the underarms.</p><p>Several other girls all dressed in dark hoodies jumped out of the Escalades and circled around the glass doors. Dean recognized them from Connie’s farm; he counted seven of them in total.</p><p>One of them retrieved the keys from the ground and pushed open the door, then the entire group walked into the store, the first girl dragging the passed-out employee. The girl with the keys expertly pried open the face of the burglar alarm and neatly disarmed it.</p><p>A few moments later, Connie herself slipped out of one of the cars and slid across the parking lot and into the bookstore.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Back in the van Samuel and Sam waited.</p><p>“We can’t go in if Dean’s here,” Samuel said. His voice tinged with frustration.</p><p>“Well, if they’re witches let’s catch them in the act. Either we will or Dean will.”</p><p>“They’re most likely going to hurt that girl,” Samuel pointed out.</p><p>“So how are they doing it, do you think?” Sam asked. “If they’re creating monsters they have to be using some sort of power for the spells, right? They must be using human sacrifices. Only way to really get a lot of juice for a spell big enough to change people into monsters.”</p><p>Samuel closed his mouth. There were no monsters, he just had to keep up the ruse to trick Sam into believing they were in Salem for a reason other than to make sure Dean didn’t try to raise Lucifer with a <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> Maybe he had taken the lie too far.</p><p>It seemed to him that since he had arrived back on Earth, he found himself doing things he never would have done before Mary’s death. Like being in business with a demon—the “King of Hell” no less. Samuel slowly shook his head. Where had his moral compass disappeared to?</p><p>They watched through the giant glass windows of the bookstore as the group headed toward the central area and started moving entire sections of books, apparently clearing out a space.</p><p>“Come on, Dean. Make a move,” Samuel murmured under his breath.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Inside his car Dean was furiously loading his sawed-off with real bullets—those girls weren’t ghosts, that was for sure. He was going to need real firepower.</p><p>From the glove compartment, he pulled out a ski mask. The good thing about Lisa was that she packed for every eventuality; even if it was the middle of summer she brought winter clothing just in case they got caught in a blizzard.</p><p>Dean pulled the ski mask over his head. Connie was inside and Dean didn’t want to get ID’d by her—after all he still might have to use her.</p><p>Dean considered how to approach the store. Since the entire facade was plate-glass windows, he might have to create a distraction first. He zipped open a pocket on his duffle bag and pulled out four small blocks of C4.</p><p>“Bobby, you’re a life saver,” he said to himself.</p><p>Bobby has a near limitless of suppliers that could get them just about anything, even highly illegal C4.</p><p>Dean pushed a series of wires into the clay-like blocks. He got out of the car and pulled Ben’s skateboard from the back seat. He then crept along the side of the building.</p><p>At the front corner he put the skateboard down, got down on his stomach and glided past the windows, low enough to remain unseen by occupants of the building. As he steered himself past the windows, Dean pushed the blocks of C4 against the glass, until every twenty feet of window had a charge attached to it. Dean then grasped his duffle and ran around the side of the building.</p><p>Halfway down the long side of the building a ladder ran up the wall to the roof. Dean clambered onto a nearby dumpster and, leaning precariously, managed to catch the bottom rung. He hoisted himself onto the ladder, scrambled up and then made his way cautiously across the roof.</p><p>Inside, Connie’s girls were clearly doing some construction of their own; a large rumbling echoed from below. Dean unscrewed an air-conditioning vent and climbed in. He could hear several voices chanting in Latin from inside the store. Crawling through the ducts, he tried to get closer to the source of the chanting.</p><p>Dean approximated that he was in the middle of the store, when he saw light filtering through a large square vent. He peeked through the slats and counted seven young girls and Connie standing in a circle. In the center, the Books ‘n’ Novels employee knelt, whimpering.</p><p>“Please, I’ll do anything. I’ll empty all the registers. I know the code to the safe in back—I dated one of the day managers.” Tears streamed down her cheeks, but her pleas were ignored as the girls continued to chant.</p><p>Dean focused his gaze on Connie. In her hands she held a small, ancient-looking book.</p><p>The <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>He froze. Could it be the one mentioned in Nathaniel’s diary?</p><p>Connie stepped forward into the circle. She held up a long silver knife and approached the blubbering captive.</p><p>“Finally, sisters, the time has come when we can raise him,” she began, her voice cold and clear. “He will be our husband and our leader. Lift up your voices to him.” Connie started to speak in Latin.</p><p>Dean slipped the small remote out of his coat pocket.</p><p>“Sorry Connie, your body count is going to stop here,” Dean murmured. He pressed the button.</p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p>He tried again.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p><span class="italic">I’m too far in the duct for it to work. There’s too much interference,</span> Dean realized. <span class="italic">Crap.</span></p><p>Connie held the knife over the girl as the chant continued.</p><p>Dean frantically pressed the button over and over. Still nothing. He was left with only one option.</p><p>He turned around awkwardly in the tight space, and with all his weight stomped onto the duct cover. The chanting stopped abruptly. Dean continued to bash his foot against the air-conditioning cover.</p><p>He heard Connie’s powerful voice echo through the store.</p><p>“You’re not going to stop me, Campbell.”</p><p>There was a crash as Dean finally broke through the vent cover, he reached his upper body into the store, holding onto the edge of the vent with one hand.</p><p>Connie flicked her hand and Dean watched horror-stricken as the employee’s head spun around 180 degrees. The girl’s eyes grew wide, then lifeless. Connie caught her with one hand by the nape of her floppy neck. With the other she sliced the blade across her throat. Blood dribbled out onto the floor, pooling over the linoleum and the industrial-grade beige rug.</p><p>The girls began chanting again.</p><p>Reaching his arm as far as he could into the store, Dean pressed the button on the remote.</p><p>Almost immediately, percussive explosions ripped through the building. Shattered glass blew everywhere. Books flew off the shelves and shredded magazines confettied everyone inside.</p><p>Dean hung from the ceiling and having replaced the remote with his sawed-off shotgun started firing. The girls took cover behind the bookshelves, but Connie remained where she was and continued chanting. Each bullet Dean fired at her ricocheted away—she had a seriously heavy duty protection spell on her.</p><p>Right beneath Dean the linoleum floor started to fracture, then heave upwards as if it was taking deep breaths. Great chunks lifted up then toppled over. The exposed earth underneath fell away, and a pair of grimy hands broke through the soil, pushing away the rocks and stone.</p><p>Connie’s chanting had ceased. She looked up at Dean. With a flick of her hand he was pulled out of the vent and thrown against the back wall.</p><p>“Out of my way, worm,” she hissed.</p><p>Connie then knelt down and gently pulled a figure out of the ground. Dust and dirt fell off of the body, like a mummy coming to life, and the figure twitched and creaked from hundreds of years of confinement. The girls gathered round in deference.</p><p><span class="italic">Must be a long buried witch,</span> Dean realized. <span class="italic">So that’s what she’s up to, sacrificing young girls to resurrect her long-dead buddies. Nice.</span></p><p>Out on the highway, Dean heard sirens scream. The girls deftly picked up the earth-encrusted figure and moved rapidly out of the store.</p><p>Dean abruptly fell from the wall down onto the maternity section. He pulled himself out of a crushed shelf display of books on breast-feeding. He limped to the front of the store and out of a gap where one of the windows had been.</p><p><span class="italic">So much for creating a diversion.</span></p><p>The Escalades were long gone. He got in his car and peeled out of the parking lot just as a long line of emergency vehicles popped over the curbs and surrounded the store.</p><p>Sam and Samuel pulled the van away.</p><p>“Guess we know what they’re doing now: resurrecting people. Didn’t look like a monster to me though,” Sam said, weaving in and out of traffic.</p><p>“I could be wrong,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Or you could be lying,” his grandson said angrily.</p><p>Suddenly he pulled the emergency brake and skidded to a stop on the side of the busy highway.</p><p>“What the hell is going on, Samuel? I trusted you! I don’t think we’re here because those witches are creating monsters. So either you bring me up to speed or I am more than happy to leave you here. You’d make a great Red Sox fan, since they always seem to lose lately. And this certainly is a losing game. <span class="italic">Tell me what’s going on.”</span> Sam stared at his grandfather.</p><p>Samuel shrugged his shoulders, recognizing that he was beaten.</p><p>“Dean is trying to get his hands on a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,”</span> he admitted.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I’m assuming so he can raise you from the dead. Get you out of Hell.”</p><p>“Dean shouldn’t put himself in so much danger,” Sam said matter-of-factly.</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“It would be bad if Dean tried to raise Lucifer mistakenly. But this is a case,” Sam said. “Those witches are up to something. You don’t start resurrecting old friends for the hell of it. “</p><p>Samuel shook his head, he couldn’t tell Sam about his deal with Crowley. He needed to make sure Dean didn’t raise Lucifer. <span class="italic">Such a stupid boy,</span> thought Samuel. He couldn’t leave Sam to watch Dean and go on this wild goose chase with witches. Whatever they were up to.</p><p>“Sam, I have things to do. I have to get back to herding Alphas. You know that,” Samuel said. “And I need your help.”</p><p>“Sorry Samuel. Innocent people are getting killed. This is a case. You can go back. But I’m staying.”</p><p>Samuel nodded. “Okay, fine.”</p><p>Sam leaned over Samuel and opened the passenger door.</p><p>“I’ll see you later.”</p><p>Samuel stared incredulously at his grandson.</p><p>“You want me to get out here?”</p><p>Sam shrugged.</p><p>“I want to follow Dean. He’s on that old witch’s tail. I don’t want to lose him.”</p><p>Samuel got out of the van. A light drizzle twinkled in the headlights of the few cars on the road at this hour.</p><p>Sam nodded, pulled the door closed, then continued to follow his brother.</p><p>Dean snuck into the hotel room just past midnight. Lisa was asleep on the bed, but as soon as Dean sat down to take off his shoes, she stirred.</p><p>“What’s that smell?” she asked.</p><p>“Cordite,” Dean said.</p><p>Lisa sat up and peered at Dean.</p><p>“Why were you firing a gun?”</p><p>“Shooting practice,” Dean said, lying down on the bed beside her. “You still mad at me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Lisa answered.</p><p>“Okay. Can we talk about it in the morning?” Dean asked.</p><p>Lisa nodded and turned her back on Dean. He shrugged; that was as good as he was going to get tonight.</p><p>He tried to close his eyes but exhausted as his body was, sleep wasn’t on the cards. He had set out to find someone to help him to raise his brother, and he had. It just hadn’t turned out like he thought it would. He had found a <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> and he had found a powerful witch who could use it. Everything would be perfect if it weren’t for the fact that she was killing young girls, and bringing old witches back from the dead.</p><p>Once again he opened up Nathaniel’s journal.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-five">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>A couple of weeks later all of Salem Village was in a frenzy. Tituba, Reverend Parris’s servant, had admitted to practicing witchcraft. She said that four figures had come to her in her sleep and told her to “sign a book” to swear allegiance to Satan. The magistrates, now four men, insisted on knowing the names of the people who had forced Tituba to hurt the girls.</p><p>More names were called and more innocent people were brought before the magistrates and accused of witchcraft. As each accused person was brought into the meetinghouse, the afflicted girls would scream and writhe in pain.</p><p>Nathaniel, Hannah, Caleb, and Thomas watched the proceedings from the back of the meetinghouse. As each day passed the theatrics of the court worried Nathaniel more and more. The town was clearly being whipped into a frenzy over witches. But since Constance and her daughters were absent from the proceedings, the question remained as to who in the court was a real witch.</p><p>From his position at the back of the room, Nathaniel had a clear view of Prudence Lewis. Day after day she stood closest to the accused, always in the same place, with the rest of the girls lined up to her right. After watching her carefully for many hours on end, Nathaniel noted that it seemed whenever the girls went into a fit, Prudence Lewis was the one they all followed. If Prudence started to scream, they all started to scream. This happened time and time again as more and more accused witches were brought in.</p><p>Nathaniel could not believe that the people being accused were all witches. One woman in particular, Martha Cory, he knew to be a pious woman who attended church every Sunday as well as Thursday scripture services. She could not be a witch.</p><p>But what was at work? It seemed as if the afflicted girls were being harassed in some way. But by what? Scrapes and scars showed up on their faces and wrists. If they weren’t doing it themselves, someone or something must be doing it to them. This behavior, coupled with the strange encounter Caleb and Thomas had had with Prudence Lewis in the cellar, made Nathaniel suspect that Prudence was somehow influencing the other girls.</p><p>“Boys, I want you to follow Prudence Lewis,” Nathaniel said. “I want to know where she goes tonight, when and with whom.”</p><p>Caleb and Thomas nodded.</p><p>That afternoon, as the winter sunlight waned and most of Salem trudged home through the snow, Caleb and Thomas waited for Prudence to leave the meetinghouse. She emerged escorted by Reverend Parris and John Hathorne and together they walked to Parris’s home. Once there, the men went inside but Prudence remained outside.</p><p>After a few moments she stepped out onto the road, and peered both ways as though to check for spies. The boys crouched behind a hedge on the other side of the road, and held their breath.</p><p>Apparently satisfied that she was alone, Prudence started walking up the road away from the village, before taking a sharp right to cut across a field. Caleb and Thomas followed a good distance behind her. They could barely see her figure in the waning light as she disappeared into the tree line.</p><p>“Is she going toward Constance Ball’s?” Caleb whispered. His shoes crunched on the firm snow as he followed in his brother’s footsteps.</p><p>“Looks like it,” Thomas replied.</p><p>“Should we tell Father?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“Let’s see what happens first,” his brother said.</p><p>When Thomas turned back around he suddenly stopped in his tracks. Prudence was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“Where did she go?”</p><p>“She was right there,” Caleb said.</p><p>They squinted at the tree line fifty yards in front of them. Prudence had definitely disappeared. The brothers looked at each other—this wasn’t what was supposed to happen. They started walking again, still keeping quiet. Thomas drew out a silver blade from his jacket. Caleb took out a wooden bat. They hadn’t any shotguns with them.</p><p>“Don’t make a sound,” Thomas murmured.</p><p>“I’m trying not to. You don’t make a sound,” Caleb hissed back.</p><p>They crept into the woods at the very spot where they had last seen Prudence. On the ground there was a circle of small footsteps, but they didn’t lead in any direction, they just stopped as if someone had scooped her up off the ground. Thomas and Caleb peered into the dark canopy above them. Shadowy, sinewy trees poked upward, their frozen branches creaking in the wind.</p><p>“Does she fly?” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Shush,” Thomas said. His blade at the ready. “She has to be around here somewhere.”</p><p>“Thoma—“ Caleb screamed.</p><p>Thomas spun around to find Caleb five feet in the air, pinned up against a tree. Prudence Lewis stood three feet away. An unseen force held Caleb up. His eyes bulged in fear.</p><p>“Thomas, I can’t breathe,” Caleb croaked.</p><p>“Let my brother down,” Thomas commanded.</p><p>“Aw, if it isn’t the Campbell boys. Did your daddy tell you to follow me?” Prudence hissed.</p><p>“Let Caleb down and maybe I won’t kill you!” Thomas threatened.</p><p>“Oh please, you can’t kill me. I’m so much more powerful than you silly boys can imagine,” Prudence said. “Not only can I do this,” she flicked her wrist and Caleb’s ears started to bleed, “but right now it seems like I can get anyone in Salem to believe anything I say!”</p><p>“You’re the one afflicting the girls,” Thomas declared. “None of those people are witches. You are!”</p><p>“Maybe, maybe not.”</p><p>“Why are you sending innocent people to jail?” Thomas demanded.</p><p>“If I tell you that I might have to kill you. Though, I might kill you anyway,” she said with a smile.</p><p>Thomas lunged at her with his knife.</p><p>Prudence took an enormous leap and landed on a low tree branch fifteen feet behind him. The distance gave Thomas ample room to run to Caleb. He jumped and hung onto Caleb’s feet, but his brother didn’t budge, and he was quickly turning blue.</p><p>“Let him down! Or I swear to God I will burn down this entire forest with you in it.”</p><p>“I’d like to see you try!” Prudence taunted.</p><p>Thomas pulled a couple of bags of herbs from his coat. He spread them on the ground and started chanting in Latin.</p><p><span class="italic">“Ego vocamus upon bonitas of life, ad concertamus tergus hic malum. Imus circa me conditi annulus of ardor. Imus circa me loco custodia.”</span> A small flame of fire sprang up in Thomas’s hand, which he threw at the base of the tree. The fire quickly spread to form a ring around the tree and the two boys.</p><p>Prudence dropped elegantly back on the ground, standing outside the ring of fire.</p><p>“Looks like you’re stuck,” she observed maliciously.</p><p>“Or you are,” Thomas said. He chanted a little more Latin. The fire rose and crackled, until it reached eight feet high. Then Thomas gave one last command in Latin.</p><p>The fire exploded over the woods. Prudence covered her face as the percussion threw her onto her back twenty feet away. Caleb dropped to the ground and Thomas ran to his brother’s side. As quickly as it had started, the fire died down to embers around them.</p><p>“How did you do that?” Prudence demanded. “You’re not a witch!”</p><p>“No, but we are not without our own tricks,” Thomas replied.</p><p>Thomas pulled Caleb up from the ground and turned back to Prudence.</p><p>“I know what you are, and you’re not going to get away with tricking the entire town into thinking those people are witches.”</p><p>“Oh really? And what are you going to do about it, Thomas Campbell? Tell your father? Tell the magistrates? I have them wrapped around my finger like a string. I’ll make sure that they know what you are.” Prudence turned on her heel and in an instant was gone.</p><p>Thomas grabbed Caleb’s shoulder and the brothers retreated back across the frozen field toward home.</p><p>“Well, one thing’s for sure,” Caleb said.</p><p>“What?” Thomas asked.</p><p>“Prudence is definitely not as pretty as she used to be.” Caleb smirked.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-six">CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean woke up at gone nine a.m, alone. He pulled himself out of bed and headed downstairs, hoping to grab a cup of coffee. Lisa was sitting at a table drinking hers, and when she looked up as he walked in, a little scowl crossed her face. Clearly, she still wasn’t happy with Dean about yesterday. The fact that he had come home past midnight probably hadn’t helped.</p><p>Dean pulled up a chair and sat down across the table from her. He fingered the lace tablecloth. He anticipated that Lisa was going to go after him, but didn’t want to be the one to speak first. This obviously wasn’t turning out to be the vacation Lisa had hoped for.</p><p>He took a deep breath; someone had to break the stalemate.</p><p>“So. I thought we could go to the beach today,” Dean began cautiously.</p><p>Lisa raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Haven’t you had enough of the water? Any second I’m expecting the police to come through the door and arrest you for causing millions of dollars of damage.”</p><p>“That wasn’t specifically my fault,” Dean countered. “Anyway, you don’t have to worry about the police, I had Ingrid change our name in the registry.”</p><p>Lisa shook her head.</p><p>“You just think of everything don’t you?”</p><p>Dean had to admit that he did.</p><p>“Where’s Ben?” he asked.</p><p>“Perry came to pick him up. I think they went sightseeing and then to watch a movie,” Lisa said.</p><p>Dean furrowed his brow.</p><p>“To a movie or to watch a movie?”</p><p>“I’m not sure. She’s a nice girl, Dean,” Lisa said. “I’ve spent more time with her than I have with you in the past couple of days. I’m thinking about taking her home instead of you.”</p><p>“But you don’t know anything about her,” Dean objected.</p><p>“So? She’s a girl, Dean. A regular girl. Not everything is a conspiracy.”</p><p>“Lisa, I’m not some wack-a-doodle who thinks we didn’t go to the moon. Though I still would like to know why we haven’t gone back.” Dean shook his head, he was getting off topic. “The point is, I’ve seen things and there are monsters everywhere. Do you know what’s <span class="italic">really</span> hiding in the sewers of New York? You don’t want to know.</p><p>“But I would like to get to know the girl a little more before sending Ben off on his own with her.”</p><p>Lisa got up from the table.</p><p>“He’s <span class="italic">my</span> son and if I think it’s okay for him to go see a movie with a girl, then it’s okay.”</p><p>Dean threw up his hands. He hated this “blended family” shit. At least with his father you always knew whose word to go by.</p><p>Dean followed Lisa out of the dining room and through the lobby area of the inn. Ingrid stood in her regular gnomish way behind the registration counter.</p><p>“Mr. and Mrs. Winchester!” she called. “Oh sorry. I meant Mr. and Mrs. Newsted. Would you like to schedule that ghost tour now? It’s ten percent off for all guests.”</p><p>“Ingrid, I hate to break it to you, but you don’t have any ghosts,” Dean said.</p><p>Ingrid gasped.</p><p>“Look,” Dean said pulling out his EMF meter. “See, nothing. No ghosts. If there were ghosts in this place believe me, I would know.”</p><p>A touristy-looking couple in Bermuda shorts and T-shirts printed with “I believe in ghosts” stared at Dean. They looked crushed.</p><p>Dean turned around.</p><p>“Sorry. Just couldn’t keep my mouth shut any longer.”</p><p>Lisa apologized to a despondent Ingrid and dragged Dean out of the inn and onto the brick sidewalk.</p><p>“Really? You had to do that didn’t you?” Lisa looked at him, incredulous.</p><p>“Lisa, I really don’t want to get into a fight about this. Where is Ben? I’m going to go pick him up.”</p><p>“There’s no talking sense into you,” Lisa said, taking out her phone. “You can call him and ask.”</p><p>“You don’t even know where he is?”</p><p>“He’s with Perry, Dean. Get over it.”</p><p>Dean pointed to her phone.</p><p>“Get him on the phone, now.”</p><p>“Why are you doing this, Dean? What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>Dean pursed his lips. For a moment, he thought about blurting it all out, the <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> the witches, the horrible murders. But he imagined her terrified face and just couldn’t do it. The truth hurts and Lisa was the last person he wanted to cause any pain.</p><p>“Can you just trust me?” he said gently.</p><p>“We aren’t here <span class="italic">just</span> for a vacation, are we Dean? Is Ben in some kind of trouble?” Lisa persisted.</p><p>“I don’t know that he’s in trouble. I’m just playing it safe. I want us three to spend time together and I would rather he not discover <span class="italic">Love Story, Part Two: The Salem Years.</span> Just call him. Please.”</p><p>Lisa pressed some buttons on her phone, then put it to her ear. After a few moments, she spoke into it.</p><p>“Ben, it’s Mom. You’re supposed to always keep your phone on, we talked about this. Call me as soon as you get this. Dean and I are going to come pick you up.” Lisa hung up and looked back at Dean. “Should I be worried?”</p><p>“No, he’s just watching a movie with a strange girl in a strange town with some very strange things going on in it.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“It means that, yes, there is something happening in this town. But I swear I didn’t know about it until we got here,” Dean said. It was, strictly, the truth.</p><p>“I knew it. Why couldn’t you tell me?”</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>“Now what are you doing?”</p><p>Dean had opened the car, which he had parked in front of the inn. He had pulled out his laptop and was furiously hacking into Lisa’s cell phone site.</p><p>“Wait a minute, how do you know my password?” Lisa asked, looking over his shoulder.</p><p>“You have a GPS on the phone right?” Dean said. “I’m just activating it so we can see where he is.”</p><p>“You still haven’t answered my question: How do you know my password?”</p><p>“Lisa, please. Favorite Show: <span class="italic">Gilmore Girls.</span> Town you grew up in: Cicero. Name of first pet: Snowball.”</p><p>“When did I tell you about my guinea pig?” Lisa asked.</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Hello! First date. I learned many things. Including how bendy you are,” Dean said with a smirk.</p><p>“I can’t believe you’re breaking into my private account and trying to charm me at the same time.”</p><p>“Please, it’s not the first time,” Dean said. “Okay, got it.” He brought up the tracking map of Ben’s cell phone. The little blip said he was somewhere on a street called Harpers Circle.</p><p>“Where is that? Is it far?” Lisa asked. “They were supposed to go to the <span class="italic">movie theater.”</span></p><p>“No, you assumed seeing a movie meant going to a movie theater. You can’t assume that with boys. Believe me, I know,” Dean said as he put the address into his phone. “Let’s go and get him, before this becomes a Thora Birch Lifetime movie.”</p><p>Lisa looked at him as they climbed into the car.</p><p>“You know, some of your pop culture references are seriously obscure.”</p><p>Dean nodded. He did know that. They pulled out into traffic. Dean was really hoping he was overreacting and everything was fine, but he had learned a long time ago that you can’t be too careful in a town when things are going ass-over-elbows.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-seven">CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Following the GPS, Dean and Lisa drove out of town and onto a double-lane freeway. A short while later, they turned onto a side street. Even though it was mid-morning, the streetlights were slowly flickering in response to a bank of dark clouds pushing in from the shore.</p><p>The road swung around in a large circle. On one side a deep thicket of trees ran along the edge; on the other a series of modern apartment buildings were set at different angles around the grounds. Suddenly, the landscape opened up, revealing a long brick building topped with spires and gothic-looking windows, that stood in stark contrast to the modern buildings that surrounded it.</p><p>Dean surveyed the scene. He had omitted to tell Lisa what else he had found out during his brief foray on the Internet. This wasn’t some ideal planned community that had popped up out of nowhere. The complex had been built on the grounds of the old state insane asylum.</p><p>They parked the car at the leasing office and walked in. Behind the counter a kid, who looked scarcely older than Ben, was sitting watching a baseball game on his computer.</p><p>“Are the Sox up?” Dean asked the kid, who hadn’t even glanced up as they walked in.</p><p>“Bottom of the eighth. Two runners on. Ortiz is up.”</p><p>“Great. Can you tell me what apartment Perry—“ Dean looked at Lisa. “What’s her last name?”</p><p>Lisa shook her head.</p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p>“Can you just look up Perry, then?” Dean said to the kid.</p><p>The kid had finally peeled his eyes away from the screen. He was regarding Dean doubtfully. “No can do, bro. I can’t give out residents’ apartment numbers.”</p><p>Dean took a twenty from his wallet.</p><p>“How about now?”</p><p>The kid eyed the money.</p><p>“Yeah, I mean, I’d have to get some sort of—“</p><p>Another twenty joined the first.</p><p>The kid smiled, clearly he was going to try to milk this for all it was worth.</p><p>“It really puts my job on the line, man.”</p><p>Unfortunately for the kid, he had overplayed his hand. With one arm Dean pushed the kid away from the desk, with the other he spun the computer screen around.</p><p>“Hey, you can’t do that. That’s private property,” the kid whined.</p><p>“Well, now it’s public,” Dean said, typing a search for Perry’s name into the computer. He drummed his fingers impatiently as the computer creaked into action. Finally it produced an answer: “Kirkbride Building, apartment twelve,” he read.</p><p>Dean swiped back his twenties and Lisa and he left. Dean swung the car back around and they parked in front of the large brick building.</p><p>“Well, at least this is nice,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Yeah, about that...” Dean pulled a pair of sawed-offs out from under his seat.</p><p>“What the hell are those for?” Lisa squealed.</p><p>“Relax, mine has real bullets, yours has salt. You might have the advantage here,” he said.</p><p>“I thought you said there was nothing to worry about?”</p><p>Dean nodded. “There isn’t. Prophylactic measure. No pun intended.”</p><p>Lisa rolled her eyes. They walked up to the entrance and rang the buzzer to Perry’s apartment. After about thirty seconds with no response, Dean began to methodically ring each of the apartment buzzers in turn. Eventually someone carelessly buzzed them in.</p><p>Apartment twelve was on the first floor. Noise filtered from each of the doors as they passed. At apartment twelve Dean knocked on the door and gestured for Lisa to talk.</p><p>“Ben? Ben Braeden? You come out here this instant,” Lisa called.</p><p>“Could you sound like more of a mom?” Dean asked.</p><p>“You try it, smart ass,” she countered.</p><p>“Fine. Give me your phone.” Dean took the phone from her and called Ben’s number. From inside the apartment they heard his phone ring. “Okay, so we know he’s in there or was there and someone hit ‘ignore’ when you called before.”</p><p>“He knows not to do that,” Lisa said.</p><p>“Maybe it wasn’t him. Hold on,” Dean said. He took his lock pick from his jacket pocket and fiddled with the lock. Seconds later, it clicked open. He turned to Lisa with a serious look in his eye. “Okay, so no matter what we find in here you’re going to stay calm, right?”</p><p>“I don’t like the sound of that. What aren’t you telling me?”</p><p>“Probably no need to worry, but this building was an insane asylum up until 1992, and in my experience, not always, but usually there are some very angry, delusional ghosts in places like these.”</p><p>“That’s crazy, Dean. It’s an apartment building now.”</p><p>“Just follow my lead,” Dean said, opening the door and walking into the apartment with his sawed-off at the ready. “Perry? Ben? Time to go home.” They moved through the apartment, checking each room in turn but the place was clearly empty. Lisa retrieved Ben’s phone from the living room sofa.</p><p>“Is that definitely his?” Dean asked.</p><p>Lisa nodded.</p><p>Dean peaked around a corner into what looked like a young girl’s bedroom. A feeling of relief washed over him when he saw that the bed was neatly made.</p><p>When he opened the doors of the built-in closet the uneasy feeling returned. Set into the plaster wall at the back was an old oak door.</p><p>“Wasn’t quite the walk-in closet I was expecting,” Dean said.</p><p>Lisa looked over his shoulder.</p><p>“That’s strange.”</p><p>“Okay, so here’s the deal: I go first. You don’t shoot unless I tell you to. Clear?”</p><p>“Who are we shooting at? Is Ben in there?” Lisa sounded panicky.</p><p>Dean pulled open the door. A musty blast of cool air hit them as they descended a steep spiral staircase.</p><p>“Somehow I don’t think this is on the rental brochure,” Dean said.</p><p>At the bottom of the staircase was a vaulted hallway which disappeared into gloom in both directions.</p><p>“These must have been used by the doctors and nurses to go between the buildings in the winter,” Dean explained.</p><p>“They couldn’t have made it a little more cozy?” Lisa said, shivering in her T-shirt.</p><p>Dean walked first into the pitch black of the tunnel. A cold chill ran through him. He took out the EMF again—the needle pinged to the max.</p><p>“That’s not good,” he said.</p><p>“What? What isn’t good?’ Lisa rushed forward to Dean, but something stopped her. “Ah, Dean?”</p><p>Dean glanced in her direction, then quickly pulled her behind him. He lifted the salt-filled shotgun out of her hands and pointed it into the darkness behind them.</p><p>BLAMMM! The gunshot echoed through the tunnels.</p><p>Out of the gloom a figure appeared. It was the ghost of an old woman in a stained robe. She continued to advance on them.</p><p>“Time for your treatment,” she wailed.</p><p>Dean shot at her again. But the specter quickly flicked to standing six inches away from Dean’s face. He backed against the wall with Lisa still behind him.</p><p>“No exceptions! Every day!” The ghost howled and held her head.</p><p>“Move,” Dean hissed urgently.</p><p>But it was too late. The ghost shot her hand out, hitting Dean square in the chest. Both guns fell from his hands and he clutched at the collar of his T-shirt, dropping to his knees.</p><p>“Can’t... can’t breathe,” he choked. His heart was quickly becoming solid, freezing over.</p><p>“Shoot her!” Dean gasped.</p><p>Lisa reached for the salt-filled sawed-off and fumbled as she tried to aim it at the ghost.</p><p>“Now, please,” Dean croaked as his lips quickly turned blue.</p><p>Lisa pulled off a shot. The bullet hit the ghost, dissipating her in an instant.</p><p>“I got her!” she said proudly.</p><p>“Only for a second,” Dean said getting off his knees and rubbing his chest. He took a canister of salt from his jacket and poured a line across the tunnel. “Let’s go.” Dean grabbed Lisa’s hand and pulled her down the tunnel.</p><p>“Ben! Ben! Where are you?” Lisa called.</p><p>Two more disgruntled ghosts of mental patients swarmed at them. Dean quickly let off a couple of shots, then poured another salt barrier.</p><p>“Mom!” Ben’s small voice echoed faintly through the tunnel.</p><p>“Ben?” Lisa called, running forward into the darkness.</p><p>Dean yanked free an iron rod that was serving as a railing on the wall. He used it to obliterate each ghost they encountered as they moved quickly forward. Further down the tunnel the low ceilings opened up into a kind of catacomb. Light seeped out from underneath an iron door. Ben called from the other side.</p><p>“Hold on, Ben. We’re here,” Dean responded.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’ve come to join us,” a voice said.</p><p>Lisa and Dean turned. A decidedly older-looking Perry stood behind them. Far from fifteen, she now looked like she was in her early twenties.</p><p>“What concerned parents you are,” she mused. “I find it touching. Really, I do. You don’t see that much these days, what with all the divorce. But you two seem to really make it work.” Perry sauntered up to Dean. She was inches away from his face. “Oh, but wait, Ben isn’t your child, is he Dean? But yet, here you are. Still attached. That’s okay though. I don’t mind. I was hoping I could be your baby mama, as they say these days.” Perry laughed.</p><p>“In this light you look a little older, Perry. So what are you pushing,” Dean spat at her, “one hundred? Two hundred?”</p><p>She eyed him. “If we’re going to have a child together, I might as well be honest. Let’s say somewhere around three hundred-eighteen. But age doesn’t matter when you have a lust like ours. Right, Dean?” Perry pawed at Dean’s chest.</p><p>“Lay off, you old slut,” Lisa growled.</p><p>“Oh look, mama grizzly made an appearance. Let me tell you something,” Perry turned toward Lisa, “a boy like Ben... Well, you really should be more careful. You wouldn’t want him ending up on Dateline.”</p><p>Lisa pulled back and punched Perry in the mouth. A line of blood trickled from her nose. Perry eyed her with shock.</p><p>“You have more spunk than I thought.”</p><p>“And you have a little mark,” Lisa said indicating Perry’s nose.</p><p>“Bitch!” Perry flung her arm aside and Lisa flew across the hallway. She collapsed to the ground, out cold.</p><p>Dean faced down Perry.</p><p>“So what’s the endgame here, Perry? You part of the killings?”</p><p>“You think I have to answer to you? You have no idea how long we’ve waited for this exact moment in time. It’s all happening, and let me tell you, none of us are going to let you stand in our way.” Perry advanced on Dean.</p><p>Dean swung the iron rod. Perry stopped it easily with one hand. Dean swung his gun around and aimed it at her, but she knocked the gun away with merely a finger. Dean was empty handed.</p><p>Perry shot out her arm and caught Dean by the collar, and then spun around and threw him against the wall. Dean crumpled to the floor, trying to catch his breath.</p><p>“You should know that being this old has a lot of advantages. If you’re really nice, I’ll let you in on the little magic secret. Forget all those animals that you hunt—vampires and all. Disgusting. Witchcraft is the real power. Who knew that a little spell and fifty human sacrifices could bring you immortality? But here I am. Living proof.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t call what you are ‘living’,” Dean said.</p><p>“Of course you would. And it’s something that’s bothered you from the get-go. Dean, you know you have a code of ethics. Are you really going to kill me? After all, I’m human. You don’t want to kill a human. I’m not a monster, after all.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that,” Dean said, as he leapt for the iron rod on the floor and swung it at her.</p><p>“Tsk. This is grounds for some serious relationship counseling.” Perry grabbed Dean by the throat and pushed him into a corner. “I think we should start this romance on the right foot, don’t you, honey?” Perry swiped the iron rod from Dean and bashed it down on his left foot.</p><p>Dean howled in pain.</p><p>“There we go. Now I know you can’t run. Just stay here for a little while. I want to get to know my new stepson better.”</p><p>Perry flicked her hand and Dean’s wrists magically bound together. She then disappeared into the room beyond the oak door. For an instant Dean caught a glimpse of Ben tied to an old electrical shock chair, then the door slammed shut. Dean struggled against his invisible bonds.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-eight">CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Lisa stirred. She slowly opened her eyes and saw Dean on the opposite side of the hallway near the door. Her head ached</p><p>“Dean? Dean, where’s Ben?” she said.</p><p>Dean shushed her. She watched him squirm on the floor. He was trying to empty out his pockets with his hands bound behind his back by an invisible force. A couple of packets of herbs fell out of his jacket. He kicked off a boot and with his big toe drew a series of sigils on the dirt-covered floor. He chanted a couple of words in Latin, then awkwardly flung his lit Zippo into the center of the circle. The herbs caught fire. Dean pulled his hands apart.</p><p>“Nothing like a little white magic to counteract the black,” he murmured.</p><p>He got up and gently pulled Lisa to her feet.</p><p>“Are you okay?” he asked.</p><p>She nodded and rubbed her head where she had hit the wall.</p><p>“I think so.”</p><p>Dean handed her the gun with the bullets.</p><p>“You’re going to need this,” he said.</p><p>“I’m not sure if I can shoot her,” Lisa said nervously.</p><p>“You’re going to feel differently in a second,” Dean replied ominously.</p><p>He swiftly loaded the other gun with real shotgun shells, then kicked open the oak door.</p><p>Inside, Ben was strapped to an electroshock chair in a dark, tiled room that must have been used for electroshock therapy. He looked scared but otherwise unharmed.</p><p>Perry sat nearby on a Victorian-era stretcher.</p><p>“Mummy and Daddy come to take their little boy home? I don’t think so,” she said.</p><p>She jumped off the stretcher and with a flick of her wrist the gurney flew across the room. Dean pulled Lisa to the ground, the speeding bed narrowly missing their heads. It struck the door blocking their exit.</p><p>Dean and Lisa peeled themselves off the floor.</p><p>Dean cocked his gun at Perry.</p><p>“Let him go and maybe I’ll let you live to see your three-hundred and nineteenth birthday,” he growled.</p><p>“Oh Dean, you and I are going to have such fun together. Imagine wiling away the years, just you and me,” Perry said. “But not yet. Still have a lot of business to do here.”</p><p>Perry walked toward Ben and took out a sharp blade.</p><p>“This is what you don’t understand Dean: All my powerful friends passed away a long, long time ago, so now we are just trying to get the old gang back together. We have a big gig coming up. But to do that, we need nice innocent young things like Ben here. You’d be sacrificing him to a good cause.”</p><p>Dean pointed his gun at Perry.</p><p>“Get away from him, bitch.”</p><p>“Dean, that’s no way to speak to your betrothed,” Perry said. She put the knife to Ben’s throat and ran it up and down the muscles of his neck. “You’re not in control of this situation. I am. And it would behoove you to learn some old-fashioned manners!”</p><p>Perry sliced the knife across Ben’s cheek for emphasis.</p><p>Lisa screamed and pulled the trigger on the gun she was holding. The bullet zinged toward Perry. She stepped out of the way, and the bullet grazed her shoulder. The wound cauterized immediately, like she wasn’t made of human flesh at all. Perry looked down at where the bullet had touched her. There was a rip in her shirt.</p><p>“This is my favorite shirt. Now look what you did to it!” She clenched her hand and Ben started choking. “This will be cleaner anyway.”</p><p>Ben’s eyes rolled back into his head as his face turned blue. His hands clenched and unclenched, straining at the wrist straps.</p><p>Dean stepped forward and leveled his gun at Perry.</p><p>“You’re way too old for him.” He pulled the trigger.</p><p>The bullet blasted through her right wrist, detaching it so that the five-finger stump of her hand hung loosely from a couple of tendons attached to her arm.</p><p>Seizing the moment, Dean sped across the room and knocked the witch to the floor. Recovering quickly, Perry scissor-kicked Dean. He ducked and landed on top of Perry, grabbed her round the neck with both hands and squeezed. She struggled against him but Dean’s whole body weight was pinning her down. He held on until she looked as though she had passed out. He then released her throat and pulled her up so he could hold her arms tight behind her back.</p><p>“Let’s tie her up,” he said.</p><p>Lisa walked over to Perry and kicked her with a well-placed sandal heel under the ribs. She used the rope that Perry had used to secure Ben to tie Perry firmly to the base of the electric chair, while Dean kept hold of her, just in case.</p><p>Dean then picked Ben up off the chair and heaved him onto his shoulder.</p><p>Ben’s eyes slowly fluttered open.</p><p>“What happened? Where am I?’</p><p>“All I can say is no more dates for you, buddy,” Dean said gently.</p><p>Perry quickly came round and struggled against her bonds.</p><p>“You can’t take him!” she cried and shut her eyes, mustering her powers once again.</p><p>Lisa, and Dean with Ben over his shoulder, didn’t wait to see what would happen next. They exited the room, Dean indicating to Lisa that she should grab the discarded iron bar, then ran back down the hallway. As they crossed over the salt lines more asylum ghosts swarmed around them. Dean remembered he had taken the salt shells out of the sawed-off.</p><p>“Ben, grab those shells in my pocket and load them into this gun,” Dean said, holding the sawed-off over his shoulder.</p><p>Ben grabbed it, and refilled it while still being carried over Dean’s shoulder. Lisa swung at the ghosts with the iron bar as best she could, clearing a path for Dean and Ben. Ben handed the gun back to Dean and then took the other and filled it in turn with salt shells. Dean then set him down and started shooting, protecting their sides and rear as they leapt forward down the dark tunnel.</p><p>“Almost there,” Lisa called from ahead. They reached the spiral staircase and raced upward. Once in the bedroom, Dean pulled the heavy dresser in front of the doorway.</p><p>“That’s not going to hold her for long,” Dean said as they left the apartment and ran down the hallway.</p><p>Outside, they piled into the car. Dean started the engine and they squealed out around the long oval loop surrounding the planned community. The car jumped off the curb and peeled into traffic.</p><p>Two miles down the highway Dean spotted a used-car dealership. He pulled the CRV around back.</p><p>“What are we doing?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“We need a new car—Perry knows this one,” Dean said, hopping out of the vehicle and approaching a grubby salesman.</p><p>Minutes later Dean came back. “Okay, everyone out.”</p><p>“Dean, I love this car. I’m still making payments on it,” Lisa protested.</p><p>“You aren’t now. Now you’re making payments on this.” He gestured to an old Ford 100 truck which looked as if it had been through a war. “Actually, I’m kidding. No payments.” Dean handed Lisa a stack of one hundred dollar bills. “We can buy a newer model when we get back.”</p><p>“Yeah, exactly when is that going to be, Dean? I think I’ve had enough of this vacation,” Lisa said as they climbed into the truck with Ben between them.</p><p>“Soon, Lisa. Soon,” Dean replied.</p><p>He pulled the truck back into traffic and headed north. Dean knew he couldn’t go home now. There was too much at stake. This had come to be about much more than getting Sam back—these witches were up to something. Something big and horrible.</p><p>“Just a little bit longer,” Dean said.</p><p>He pulled the truck into a rundown motel and jumped out.</p><p>“Why are we stopping here?” Lisa asked.</p><p>“New digs. I’ll be back in a second.”</p><p>Dean left them in the car and headed into the New England colonial-themed lobby, complete with a Paul Revere statue.</p><p><span class="italic">This is more like it,</span> he thought.</p><h2><span id="chapter-twenty-nine">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</span><a href="#chapter-twenty-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam sat on the bar stool staring into space, but when the hot blonde, twenty-something in the tight jeans and the Old Clappy’s Clam Shacky T-shirt walked in—he noticed. Her right hand was bandaged up to the elbow but she still held herself with much more poise than was usual for someone her age. She looked around the bar and sat down a couple of stools away from Sam.</p><p>“Whiskey, water back please,” she called to the bartender.</p><p>The bartender, a grizzled old Red Sox fan, peered at her through the gloom.</p><p>“Gonna have to see some ID, young lady,” he said, lumbering toward her.</p><p>The girl dug her hand into her pocket but came out empty. She leaned over the bar, smiled and gently touched the man’s hand.</p><p>“I don’t have it. But I’m good, right?”</p><p>The man blinked a couple of times, as if he had forgotten the question he had asked two seconds earlier.</p><p>“Sure, sweetheart. No problem,” he said.</p><p>He returned with her drink a few moments later.</p><p>“It’s on him.” The bartender nodded toward Sam at the end of the bar.</p><p>Sam raised his drink in the girl’s direction.</p><p>“You’re persuasive. I like that in a woman,” Sam said.</p><p>The girl eyed him. Then she slipped off her stool and took the seat next to him.</p><p>“I’m glad. Not many men do. Usually they’re scared of me.”</p><p>“I don’t see why,” Sam said, “you seem perfectly sweet to me.”</p><p>“I do? Well, thanks. I’m Prudence, by the way.” The girl leaned over and stuck out her hand.</p><p>“Sam. Nice to meet you. Prudence? Interesting name.”</p><p>“Old family name,” she said. “I used to hate it, but over the years I’ve gotten used to it. Cheers,” she said, raising her glass to clink with Sam’s.</p><p>Sam looked at the girl. She was definitely do-able.</p><p>“Why don’t you come back to my room? I have a six-pack and another one in the fridge. We could get to know one another better.” Sam ran his hand down his stomach, indicating one of the six-packs.</p><p>“Does that work on all the girls?” Prudence asked.</p><p>“Pretty much, yeah,” Sam said.</p><p>“Guess it’s working now too,” she said, throwing back her whiskey. “Let’s go.”</p><p>They headed toward the door. Sam walked behind the girl to admire the view. She was cute, very cute.</p><p>Back at the motel, Sam popped open two beer bottles. He held one out to Prudence, then hesitated.</p><p>“You’re over twenty-one right? I wouldn’t want to be accused of corrupting a minor.”</p><p>“Way over. But thanks for your concern,” Prudence said, taking the bottle. She strolled around the colonial-themed hotel room. “Nice place. I remember when this was just a field, not a parking lot and a chintzy motel.”</p><p>“Really?” Sam stepped behind her and pushed his hand down her shirt. Prudence turned around and looked into Sam’s eyes.</p><p>“There’s something you should know about me,” she said.</p><p>“What’s that?”</p><p>“I’m more experienced than I look.” Prudence smiled and started undressing.</p><p>Sam did the same and dropped onto the bed. Prudence approached him, took off the rest of her clothes and started to ravenously kiss him. Sam pulled her small body onto his.</p><p>“What happened to your hand?” Sam asked.</p><p>“Misunderstanding. I got greedy. Took something before I should have. Patience is key. I forget that sometimes.”</p><p>“I’m having trouble being patient right now,” Sam said, angling himself under her.</p><p>Sam reached to shut off the light. He glanced at the little notepad neatly placed underneath the Paul Revere-like lantern lamp. On the heading it said: “YE OLDE COLONIAL INN est. 1919.”</p><p>“You remember this place when it was just a field?” he asked casually.</p><p>Prudence continued to nibble on his ear.</p><p>“Yeah, why?” she said as she straddled him. “You remind me of a horse I once had.”</p><p>“Giddy-up,” Sam said.</p><p>A little while later, Sam got up from the bed. He pulled on his jeans.</p><p>“Where are you going? I was just getting ready for more.” Prudence patted the bed beside her.</p><p>“Just looking for something I think you’ll like,” Sam said, digging into his duffle bag. “Here it is.”</p><p>Sam swung around and pointed his sawed-off shotgun at her.</p><p>Prudence looked up at him.</p><p>“Whatever,” she said, laying back down on the pillows. “Second time today, no big deal. When are you people going to get it into your heads that I can’t be killed... Not like that, anyway.”</p><p>Sam advanced on her.</p><p>“So what are you? A shapeshifter? Werewolf? What?”</p><p>Prudence ignored the gun and instead climbed off the bed and grabbed her T-shirt.</p><p>“I’m a witch, ya big ox. And an old one at that. But I still need to get out and let loose. It’s been a very stressful summer.”</p><p>A cord of rope hit her in the back as she pulled on her jeans. Sam stood closer now, still aiming the gun at her.</p><p>“Sit down and tie your feet.”</p><p>“You really think something like this is going to hold me?” Prudence asked over her shoulder.</p><p>“Take a closer look,” Sam said.</p><p>Prudence held the rope up and noticed a weave of different herbs braided into the cord and a smelly paste rubbed into the crevices.</p><p>“Think of it as my own lasso of truth,” he said.</p><p>Prudence sat mechanically in the straight-backed chair next to the bed and tied her feet to its legs.</p><p>“What are you going to do to me, Sam? You know, I would have let you tie me up if you’d asked.”</p><p>“Stop yapping. I’m going to ask you questions and you’re going to answer them. Get it?”</p><p>Setting aside the sawed-off, he pulled the ropes tightly around Prudence’s lithe wrists, conscious of securing them as tight as possible around her bandaged one. He then left her and went into the bathroom. Pipes creaked and there was the sound of water rushing into the bathtub. Back in the room, he grabbed another chair, swung it around, sat down and crossed his arms over the back, resting his chin on his wrists. He stared at Prudence.</p><p>“So let’s play ‘What the hell are the witches doing?’ shall we? First question: Why are you resurrecting bodies? Whose are they?”</p><p>Prudence’s lips broke into a smile, her tiny, pearl-white teeth gnashed together.</p><p>“Oh games? I love games. But you have to play by the rules. One question at a time. But I’ll answer both for you. None of your freaking business. And screw off.”</p><p>“Wrong,” Sam said.</p><p>He stood up and spun the chair around. He grabbed the back of Prudence’s chair with one hand and his chair with the other and dragged both into the bathroom. He set the empty chair sideways next to the bathtub so that the legs pointed parallel to the side of the tub. Next he hefted Prudence’s chair so that her head hung halfway into the filled tub.</p><p>“So this is what we are going to do,” he began “Again. I hate to repeat myself. You’re going to answer my questions and if you don’t, you get dunked.” To demonstrate, Sam lifted the legs of Prudence’s chair and her head dipped into the water. Sam then righted the chair. “See? It’s a lot of fun.”</p><p>“Whatever, Sam, I took swimming lessons in the thirties. Eighteen thirties. That’s not going to do anything to me.”</p><p>“Oh, I forgot something,” Sam said. From his back pocket he pulled out a polyester pillowcase. He thrust it over her head and re-dunked her. “Now, officially, this isn’t happening. Just remember that if you ever go up in front of Congress.”</p><p>He pulled her back up. Prudence strained to catch her breath. But with each breath the wet material caught in her mouth, making it impossible to take in air.</p><p>Sam stood back and watched her panic.</p><p>Then he dunked her back into the water, <span class="italic">One Mississippi, two Mississippi...</span> and brought her back up.</p><p>“Let’s try that again,” he said. “Why are you resurrecting bodies?”</p><p>Prudence gasped and flailed her head from one side to the other.</p><p>“It’s a process,” she gasped. “A means to an end.”</p><p>“What’s the end?”</p><p>Prudence stayed silent. Sam tipped the chair back again.</p><p>“Okay, okay. We need the power, for a larger purpose. We’re resurrecting the most powerful witches of all time, most from back when we first came to this country.”</p><p>“Why?” Sam asked. “Keep talking.”</p><p>“I can’t breathe. Take the hood off. Please,” Prudence whined.</p><p>Sam whipped the pillowcase off her head and she gulped air.</p><p>“Keep talking,” Sam directed.</p><p>“Let me catch my breath,” Prudence wheezed.</p><p>Sam sat on the toilet, impatient.</p><p>Prudence looked at him. A smile crossed her face.</p><p>“What are you smiling at?” he growled.</p><p>“Oh nothing. Just you. Men. Big, stupid babies with no ability to understand cause and effect.”</p><p>“What the hell does that mean?” Sam said.</p><p>“You forgot what water does, asshole,” Prudence said.</p><p>Sam glanced into the tub and saw that the dark paste that he had rubbed on the rope had come off during the dunkings. Prudence’s long hair cascaded down her back, soaking both her shirt and the ties that bound her. In an instant, she tore apart the rope that bound her wrists, threw out her hand and Sam flew out of the bathroom and landed on his back in the middle of the bedroom.</p><p>“Give a lady her privacy, will you?” Prudence slammed the bathroom door behind her.</p><p>Sam got up and staggered toward the door. He pounded on it.</p><p>The door flew open. Prudence was completely free of her bonds and it seemed she wasn’t in the mood for talking. With a flick of her wrist she threw Sam against the motel room door. He slumped down, trying to not to lose consciousness.</p><p>“What is it with you Campbells? Why can’t you stay out of the way?”</p><p>“How do you know I’m a Campbell?” Sam demanded.</p><p>Prudence stomped over to Sam, picked him up by the collar and bent down until they were face to face.</p><p>“Because I can smell it on you,” she spat. “You’re always the goody goody do-gooders who come to rescue everyone. When it’s really <span class="italic">you people</span> who need rescuing. The funny thing is you’ve been doing it for hundreds of years and you still haven’t learned.”</p><p>“You know, I see your yapper moving, but I really don’t care.”</p><p>Prudence swung her leg over Sam’s lap and straddled him.</p><p>“You of all people should care, Sam Winchester. Because even though little you is up <span class="italic">here,</span> the real man-of-the-hour is below. And now that he’s out of that pesky cage, with all those super seals broken, he can be freed again.”</p><p>“How do you know about that?” Sam struggled to move, but her legs held him tightly in place. <span class="italic">Who the hell is this little bitch?</span> he wondered.</p><p>“Really, you’re going to ask me that? Do you have any idea how powerful I am? How powerful my family is? I know everything about you. Besides word gets around in certain circles.</p><p>“I’m sort of pleased to meet you actually. It’s a bit of an honor. Lucifer’s vessel. Too bad he still isn’t in it. That would have been one hell of a honeymoon.”</p><p>“You want to spring Lucifer? That’s ridiculous. That’s suicide,” Sam said.</p><p>“For a human like you. For powerful witches, not so much. Still difficult. No one aces their SATs on the first try. We didn’t in 1692, but we didn’t have all the facts. We didn’t know about the seals. But compared to his previous prison, Lucifer is in a bed and breakfast. And we’re going to get him out.”</p><p>“You can’t put a collar around his neck. He’s not going to do what you tell him. Believe me, we’ve tried,” Sam said.</p><p>“Oh yes he will. We have a little book that we’ve been using for ages. It’s not an Oprah pick—the human sacrifices alone would make that a no-go for her. But it’s very powerful and it’s going to take Lucifer and wrap him around all our little fingers. After we raise him, he’ll do exactly what we tell him to do.”</p><p>“It will never work,” Sam said.</p><p>“Third time’s the charm. You know, we tried again when you were born, thinking maybe the seals were broken when you popped out. But no such luck. But now. Thanks to you. Well, we can’t lose.</p><p>“I must say I’m glad this body got saved though.” She ran her finger down his chest. “Because it is a specimen. See, I have a little theory: You’re up here, Lucifer is down there, but you guys were specially made for one another. I think if this works, he’s gonna pop into you like a hand into a glove. Hmm. Somehow that turns me on a little.” Prudence ran her tongue up Sam’s cheek. “Yummy. Anyway, I would love to stay and chat but we have three more sacrifices to make before the big day. We will be seeing a lot of one another. Very soon.”</p><p>“You can’t do that. You can’t raise him,” Sam said.</p><p>“Oh Sammy, don’t tell me what I can and cannot do. Besides we are raising <span class="italic">all</span> the Princes of Hell. So, don’t worry, Lucifer won’t be lonely. He’s going to have all his brothers with him. Unlike you. Got to run. Bye now.” Prudence leaned down and gave Sam one last salty kiss on the mouth. Then she left.</p><p>Sam pulled himself up and headed for the mini-fridge. He took out a bottle of beer and sat on the bed mulling over the night’s events. Going after Prudence would prove futile at this point He’d have to wait and catch them in the act. And what would happen if the witches actually succeeded in raising Lucifer again? Would he come after him? Sam shook his head. He wasn’t scared, he actually felt very little. Revenge was the only thing he could feel; he only cared about getting those witches. It was a need. Not even a rational thought. It was the only thing he could concentrate on.</p><p>Sam stood up, grabbed his duffle and left the motel room. He walked down the cement sidewalk that ringed the motel rooms, passing room five. Then got into the van and left.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Ten feet away inside room five, Dean thumbed frantically through Nathaniel’s journal. He needed to know what Perry was talking about. If she was three-hundred-and-eighteen years old, as she said she was, then she had to have been involved in the Salem witch trials. Which meant she had to have a connection to Constance. Killing young people, resurrecting bodies--what were the witches up to?</p><p>“What did you give him?” Lisa asked.</p><p>She sat propped up on the other bed. Ben slumbered beside her. Dean had figured the kid would need a good night’s rest, what with his encounter with Perry and the events of the day, and as being tied up could have adverse affects on a child, and maybe a clear head and a good breakfast would make the experience a little more manageable for him...</p><p>“Just a little something. Don’t worry. It’s prescription,” Dean said.</p><p>“That’s what I’m worried about.”</p><p>Dean turned back to Nathaniel’s journal. He wondered if there was a way to raise Sam and stop Connie in the process. He came across a passage and started reading.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty">CHAPTER THIRTY</span><a href="#chapter-thirty" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Nathaniel and the boys set off for town the next morning. They knew Constance was a witch, and the boys’ encounter with Prudence proved that she was too. Nathaniel warned Caleb and Thomas to be extra careful. They didn’t know what the witch’s next move would be. Nathaniel suspected that it had to do with the unearthed graves, but he had no proof. The one thing he was keenly aware of was that he had to stop the witch trials. Innocent people were being sent to jail and soon the hangings would begin.</p><p>Nathaniel and his sons reached the meetinghouse a little late. Every day the building would be so packed full of people that a crowd would form outside the door, spilling onto the street. The Campbells pushed their way into the room and found places at the very back in a corner. Three new people had been accused of witchcraft, and they were brought up to the stand and questioned. In most cases, the accused were so frightened that they weren’t able to answer the magistrates’ questions clearly, which only made things worse.</p><p>After an hour or so of futile questioning, two men appeared in the doorway dragging a woman between them. As they pushed their way through the crowd, Nathaniel recognized the woman as Bridget Bishop, who twelve years before had been accused of witchcraft, though at the time no proof had been found. As she was pushed before the magistrates, the crowd started to spit accusations.</p><p>The afflicted girls took one look at her and started to scream. Bridget covered her ears with her hands and the girls did the same. Everything Bridget did, the girls pantomimed, contorting themselves as if their movements were being painfully forced from their bodies.</p><p>The judges called for calm.</p><p>Judge William Stoughton, who had been appointed by the governor, spoke first. He asked Bridget if she knew why she had been brought in front of the court. She said she didn’t know. Stoughton told her that she was accused of hurting the girls through witchcraft. He pointed to the afflicted girls, including Prudence Lewis, in the corner. Bridget replied that she didn’t know the girls.</p><p>As she spoke, Prudence started to wail and writhe around. The other girls followed suit. The crowd rumbled with fear and anger, convinced that Bridget was hurting the girls before their very eyes. Bridget started to cry.</p><p>Anger rose inside Nathaniel until he could stand it no more.</p><p>“Your honors, I’d like to speak if I may,” he called. Nathaniel raised his hand and pressed forward through the crowd. All heads turned to look at him as he moved. A murmur swelled from the crowd and passed like a wave out into the street. <span class="italic">Nathaniel Campbell has something to say.</span> The magistrates lifted their eyes at this new interruption.</p><p>Nathaniel reached the front of the room and addressed the judges. His voice rang loud and clear and the crowd hushed so they could hear his words.</p><p>“Magistrates, I’d like to speak on behalf of the accused,” he began. “By my count you have some sixty-two people in jail for witchcraft at the present.”</p><p>William Stoughton responded, “Mr. Campbell, you do realize that this court has recently been appointed as a court of Oyer and Terminer by the governor of Massachusetts?”</p><p>“I do know that, yes. But that doesn’t change the fact that you have imprisoned a large number of people. And the proof that they are witches, well...” Nathaniel paused, then continued, “Your proof, sirs, is like smoke.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Stoughton asked.</p><p>“If I set a fire right here—“ Nathaniel began.</p><p>“Surely you wouldn’t do that,” Stoughton said.</p><p>“You’re right. But this is an example. If I set a fire with you on one side of the smoke and me on the other, you would see the smoke one way and I would see it another way.”</p><p>“I don’t understand your meaning,” Stoughton said.</p><p>“We would both see smoke, but it would look different to you than it would to me because of the different places we are standing, you over there, and me here. As the smoke twists and turns it looks even more different. If we both had to describe the smoke, you would not recognize what I described and I would not recognize what you described, even though we were looking at the same fire.”</p><p>“What is your point, Mr. Campbell?” Stoughton asked. “We are running short on time.”</p><p>“I would think that when lives are at stake accuracy is as important as expediency,” Nathaniel said.</p><p>Stoughton’s face tightened.</p><p>“I’d like you to arrive at your argument, Mr. Campbell.”</p><p>“Judge Stoughton, the afflicted girls are describing what smoke looks like from where they are seated. And others are describing what smoke looks like from where they are. Both are correct, but perhaps that means that neither is more right than the other.”</p><p>“Are you wasting our time, Mr. Campbell?” Stoughton asked. His patience was clearly running out.</p><p>Nathaniel took a deep breath. He had to make the judges see what was clear as day to him.</p><p>“Perhaps what this woman did isn’t being perceived correctly by those young women over there,” he said, keeping his voice clear and steady. “Perhaps they are feeling hurt, but it isn’t coming from this woman.”</p><p>“Are you accusing these young girls of lying, Mr. Campbell?” the judge’s voice was steely.</p><p>“I’m not saying they are lying,” Nathaniel replied, “only that perhaps they are mistaken.”</p><p>Prudence stopped her hysterics for a second and stared at Nathaniel. She then started to scream and point at him.</p><p>“Stop! Stop, you evil man!” she yelled. “I’ve done nothing to you and you are pinching and scraping me!”</p><p>The judges looked at Prudence as she writhed in pain, red welts swelling on cheeks. Then they turned back toward Nathaniel.</p><p>“Mr. Campbell, why are you hurting this innocent girl?” Stoughton demanded.</p><p>“I’m not,” Nathaniel replied firmly. “I am but standing here.”</p><p>“But she says you are hurting her. Look how she writhes in pain.”</p><p>Prudence continued to scream and cry.</p><p>“Seize him!” Stoughton declared and gestured that the two men standing closest to Nathaniel should restrain him. The men immediately grasped hold of Nathaniel, holding him tightly so that he had no hope of escape. “Nathaniel Campbell you are charged with witchcraft. Take him to the jail.”</p><p>Nathaniel was marched forcefully through the crowd and out into the cold morning air.</p><p>Panicked, Caleb and Thomas pushed through the other onlookers to follow their father. They stumbled out of the building to see the men drag Nathaniel to a cart and throw him into the back. He recovered quickly and turned around, frantically scanning the crowd, searching for his children.</p><p>“Father!” the boys shouted, racing toward him.</p><p>“Boys! Go tell your mother. Don’t worry about me. Watch Prudence, she’s dangerous. Find out what she and Constance are doing!” Nathaniel called as the cart pulled away.</p><p>The two brothers looked at one another, realizing they were on their own. They stealthily returned to the packed meetinghouse. As they walked in, Thomas looked over at Prudence. She stared back at him with a small smirk on her face.</p><p>“You stay here,” Thomas whispered to Caleb. “I’m going to go tell Mother.”</p><p>Caleb nodded and Thomas crept out of the meetinghouse. He took his father’s horse from the post and rode home quickly over the same field where Prudence had attacked them.</p><p>When he reached the Campbell homestead, his mother was outside feeding the pigs. Thomas leapt from the horse and quickly explained what had happened.</p><p>Rose Mary called for Hannah. They would visit Nathaniel in jail.</p><p>The women quickly got ready. Hannah took a couple of silver pieces from an old box. She also packed a basket full of food, since many prisoners didn’t get fed at all in jail.</p><p>Back outside, the three said goodbye and agreed that they would meet back at home that evening to exchange news.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-one">CHAPTER THIRTY-ONE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-one" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>The snow and the freeze had melted in only a couple of weeks and the damp smell of spring was making the village all the more jumpy. Now that the weather was better, it had been decided that the hangings should begin. The crowd buzzed around the meetinghouse like angry bees waiting for the next victim. As soon as the last paper was signed the accused were taken out of the meetinghouse and loaded onto a wooden cart.</p><p>The entire village would then follow the creaking cart into Salem Town as it made its way off the main road and up the grassy hill. In each instance, Prudence Lewis followed behind the crowd, supported by her uncle and Reverend Parris. She among all the girls insisted on witnessing the deaths of those she had accused.</p><p>Bridget Bishop had been the first to be hanged. The entire village had come out to see her undoing.</p><p>After the first hanging it seemed as if the town could not wait for more. Another hanging was scheduled for two days later, and after that it seemed as if the hangings didn’t stop. Day after day, women and men were brought from the jail to the hill and hung until they were dead. Some protested their innocence even up to the last moment, as their heads were pushed through the noose. Others stayed silent.</p><p>Thomas and Caleb watched the proceedings from a grassy field, far from the eyes of the townspeople. Since Nathaniel’s arrest and imprisonment, they had kept out of sight. Their mother was the only one that went into town. The children stayed home. While Nathaniel was in jail, they didn’t want to provoke the witches.</p><p>Day after day they went over the question of what exactly the witches were up to. Accusations of witchcraft had become rampant in Salem, with any strange behavior leading to accusations between friends and neighbours. However, the Campbells’ only real concern was Constance and Prudence. Both were powerful, dangerous witches. But proving that to the judges seemed impossible. It was clear that Prudence was puppeting the trials, but why?</p><p>There were over a hundred accused people, many of them held in the same jail as Nathaniel. With each passing day, the family feared that Nathaniel would be the next to be called up by the magistrates and hanged.</p><p>After witnessing a particularly brutal hanging early one morning, Thomas and Caleb made their way home through the woods and fields. They followed their usual route which took them far from Salem Village, out of the range of the prying eyes of any hysterical villagers or vengeful witches. As they entered a clutch of trees, they came across a small hill they normally didn’t pay much attention to, hidden as it was from the view of the main path. Today, they both paused and stared as the knoll was dotted with dirt mounds. Someone had clearly tried to hide freshly dug earth under piles of branches spiked with furry new leaves. Curious, the boys cleared away the branches.</p><p>“You first,” Thomas said.</p><p>“Why me?” Caleb sighed.</p><p>“Because you’re the youngest,” Thomas insisted.</p><p>Caleb knew what he had to do. He knelt down and started scooping the earth away with both hands. The dirt came apart easily, and soon body parts started to appear like gruesome spring flowers. Thomas knelt down to help his brother.</p><p>They uncovered five bodies in all, each with their throat cut, just like they had seen on the dead bodies of Abigail Faulkner and the transient. They didn’t recognize any of the corpses. Clearly, the witches had got smart and decided that murdering travelers and hiding the bodies was a more efficient way of operating.</p><p>“What should we do?” Caleb asked.</p><p>“We need to tell Father,” Thomas said.</p><p>“How can we do that? They won’t let us in to see him,” Caleb pointed out.</p><p>“I guess we need to handle this by ourselves then,” Thomas said. The boys slid down the hill and headed toward home.</p><p>* * *</p><p>That night Caleb, Thomas, and Hannah dressed in dark clothing and stealthily rode toward the jail in Salem Town, Hannah on her mother’s horse and the boys riding their father’s. Unlike Salem Village, the town was heavily populated as it crowded around a couple of inlets with the bay stretching beyond to the sea.</p><p>The children dismounted a couple of blocks from the jail and tied the horses up behind an old barn. The jail was an imposing red stone building set on a grassy plain, which meant approaching would be difficult without the guards noticing. Pulling out his pocketknife, Thomas cut down branches and grass and draped them over himself and his siblings for camouflage.</p><p>Moving slowly and silently, they crawled toward the building.</p><p>Once they had reached the safety of its dark shadows, they shed the branches and Thomas took from his pack a long rope with an iron hook on the end. He whipped the rope up with practiced ease and caught the hook on the stone balustrade at the top of the building.</p><p>Caleb then grasped the rope and started walking up the wall. His goal was a narrow barred window some thirty feet up. Hannah had visited the jail with her mother on several occasions so she knew roughly where the cells were and which hallways led where. She was confident that this particular window led to a small hallway that should be deserted at night. Nathaniel was being kept two floors below.</p><p>Halfway up the side of the building, Caleb lost his footing and he smacked against the stone wall with a thud. Hannah gasped, and she and Thomas dived for cover under their discarded camouflage branches.</p><p>There was a loud clang as the guard opened the gate and peeked around the side of the building from which Caleb dangled. Fortunately, he didn’t look up, and in the faint moonlight failed to spot Thomas and Hannah holding their breath beneath the branches.</p><p>After a few moments, the guard went back to the front of the building, but it was clear he didn’t immediately go back inside. The smell of a pipe stuffed with English tobacco wafted around the corner.</p><p>Time was running short. Shaking off the branches, Hannah gestured frantically for Caleb to continue climbing. When he reached the window he slid one leg in, then the other, and disappeared from view.</p><p>Inside the building, Caleb dropped four feet to the ground, and there was a faint splash as his boots hit the wet stone floor. The inside of the jail was cold and dark, and the stench of human waste was almost overpowering. Caleb could hear someone groaning in one of the cells closest to him. He shivered, feeling a tingle of fear go down his spine.</p><p>Pushing the thought aside he got out the rough sketch Hannah had supplied him with. He examined the piece of paper by the faint light from the window, then inched forward into the darkness. A staircase in the back corner of the building should lead him down to his father’s cell.</p><p>“Who’s there?” a female voice whispered out of the darkness. “Please, sir. Please help me.”</p><p>Knowing he couldn’t afford a moment’s distraction, Caleb stopped and hoped that the woman would think he was gone.</p><p>“Please sir, come closer,” the voice said.</p><p>Caleb crept over to a small three-foot-by-two-foot cell. He could see the faint outline of a woman huddled in the corner.</p><p>“Sir, Dorcas Good, Sarah Good’s daughter, is over in the cell beyond. Please see if she’s well. Her mother was hanged and no one has spoken or seen to her in weeks.”</p><p>“I will,” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Is that you, Caleb?” the woman crawled toward him. Caleb could now see it was Marium Teller. An old woman who used to sell apples on the street.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am. It is me,” Caleb replied.</p><p>“What a good boy you are. Are you helping your father this fine day in your fields?”</p><p>Caleb eyed the poor old woman, she had clearly lost her mind. In his jacket pocket he had stuffed a couple of loaves of bread. Caleb took one out and slid it between the bars for the old woman. He then continued down the hallway, moving as softly as he could.</p><p>In an even tinier, damper cell, chained to the wall, was four-year-old Dorcas Good. Her mother had been one of the first to be accused of witchcraft and she had been second to be hanged after Bridget Bishop. Dorcas was filthy and covered in dirt and her own feces, Caleb struggled not to recoil from the smell. The tiny girl looked at him with wild, untamed eyes. Caleb pushed his last loaf of bread toward her. She grabbed it and started to tear into it with her teeth like an animal. The sight tore at Caleb’s heartstrings. Despite her being such a tiny child, Dorcas had been accused of witchcraft. How the magistrates could think such a thing was impossible to know.</p><p>In the faint moonlight, Caleb found the staircase and made his way carefully down two flights of stairs and onto another corridor of cells. He passed Marshall Lewis, a man who was accused of witchcraft because his neighbor’s horse went lame after they had an argument.</p><p>“Hey you boy!” Marshall called out. “Whatcha doin’ here?”</p><p>“Shushh,” Caleb said.</p><p>“Hey guards. Guards! What’s this boy doin?”</p><p>Caleb frantically looked for a place to hide, he noticed two bars of one cell were a little more spread apart then the rest. He squeezed through them and found himself in a cell with a sleeping woman.</p><p>A minute or so later, he heard the guards march heavily along the corridor coming to investigate the commotion.</p><p>“There’s a boy in here. There’s a boy in here,” Marshall cried.</p><p>“Shut up, ye old coot,” a guard said, spitting on him.</p><p>“But he’s there, he’s over there!”</p><p>The guard undid the lock on the man’s cell and gave him a slap with a bully bat. Marshall huddled in the corner until the guard tired of beating him and left.</p><p>Caleb waited until the coast was clear and then climbed out from between the bars. He pitied the man, who was clearly crazy, but his second close encounter with the guards only made him want to escape this terrible place even more quickly.</p><p>He crept on and a few minutes later, to his relief, he found Nathaniel’s cell.</p><p>“Father?” Caleb whispered.</p><p>“Caleb. Dear boy.” Nathaniel reached through the bars and grasped his son’s shoulder affectionately. “How on Earth did you get in here, and how do you think we’re going to get out?”</p><p>“Thomas thought of something. Don’t worry,” Caleb replied with a smile.</p><p>Reaching into his jacket for his tools, Caleb deftly picked the lock on the cell just like his father had taught him.</p><p>The two Campbells moved swiftly and silently down the corridor, they turned a corner and paused. The guards were close by. Caleb gestured for his father to wait.</p><p>At that moment, they heard a terrible wail of pain coming from outside the jail.</p><p>It was followed quickly by a sudden commotion as the guards rushed outside to see what was going on. Nathaniel and Caleb crept cautiously down the stairs and toward the entrance to the building. The guards had all fled outside, bar one, who Nathaniel swiftly took care of with a carefully placed blow to the head.</p><p>From the gate of the jail in the distance, Nathaniel and Caleb could see a bonfire surrounded by robed figures. It looked like a gathering of witches but in actuality, as Caleb explained briefly to his father, it was a series of sticks clothed in Hannah’s old dresses. The guards crept closer, convinced by the firelight casting strange shadows that they were about to surprise a witchy gathering.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nathaniel and Caleb slipped away. As they ran, Nathaniel looked to his youngest son.</p><p>“Well done, Caleb,” Nathaniel said. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“All those poor people in jail. They’re not witches, Father.”</p><p>“I know. We’re going to take care of this, I promise.”</p><p>They hurried to find Hannah and Thomas.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-two">CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-two" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean flipped the pages and noticed a note written in different handwriting in the top right-hand corner of the journal:</p><p>This is the last journal entry by Nathaniel Campbell.</p><p>Fall 1692</p><p>Much joy and pain I feel tonight. As I write this, night falls around my cozy house. A home filled with my family and love like nothing else. But it is tonight that I must go out and fight perhaps the most hideous evil I have seen in my many days as a hunter.</p><p>For posterity now seems to be the perfect time to recount my induction into the profession of being a hunter.</p><p>It was very fortunate that my family and Rose Mary’s met on the treacherous voyage to the New World. As it turned out, there would be two families of the same profession in this New World, hers and mine. Of course, this was before we both were born. My father and Rose Mary’s father fostered a strong friendship and created a pact to protect each other’s families. With that pact they also promised to pass along the family profession. Sadly, Rose Mary’s mother died in childbirth in 1650. This brought our two families even closer. My father had married a hunter, and my mother’s mother was a hunter too.</p><p>Because of her mother’s passing Rose Mary and I were very close, and she would often visit my parents’ homestead. In fact our parents were close until the day Rose Mary’s family perished in a wendigo attack, and only she survived. My father never forgave himself for being unable to save his friend and his family.</p><p>When we came of age at ten years old, my father took us both out to the woods. I must recount that both Rose Mary and I were most afraid of what my father was about to do. Until this time we didn’t know about hunting, we thought our parents were simple farmers. But, of course, that was not the case. My father took us a mile from the house into the darkest recesses of the woods and I will never forget the sight before me. Tied to a tree, chained with iron shackles, was a naked man shivering in the cool night air. Rose Mary squealed, but then held her tongue. I, however, knew that my father wouldn’t have shown us this strange sight unless there was a lesson to be learned. He handed Rose Mary and I a flintlock musket each. The weapons felt heavy and unwieldy in our small hands.</p><p>“What are we to do with this?” I asked.</p><p>“Just wait and watch,” my father replied sternly.</p><p>As the moon rose full over the woods, slowly the man before us started to snarl. Then he began to arch his body, howling in pain as silver hair sprouted over his entire body. Eventually what stood before us was a man no longer, but rather a most uncommon beast—a wolf.</p><p>So hideous and frightening was the sight that Rose Mary cowered and I wanted to turn away, but my father insisted we keep our eyes on the creature. Still shackled to the tree, the wolf paced and gnashed his awful teeth. He lunged at us as if there wasn’t a man inside him at all.</p><p>“See the animal before you,” my father said, “he was once a man. A good man. But he has been unfortunately cursed. He was bitten by a creature, much like the creature you see before you now. It’s in his nature to roam these woods and hunt and eat humans. The man inside him would surely be appalled by such acts. But the animal, it’s his instinct. What do you think the man would feel if tomorrow he woke up and remembered all the awful things his animal self had done in the night?”</p><p>Rose Mary piped up, “He would surely feel most awful.”</p><p>“Exactly Rose Mary, he would hate himself. He would be ashamed, and he might even turn his rage upon himself. But he won’t stop. He can’t stop, because this animal is inside him. The one blessing is that he won’t remember his actions as a beast once he turns back into a man. But he will kill. So what do you think this man would ask us to do?”</p><p>“He would surely ask us to kill him to save the people he might kill,” I offered. “If he was a good man he would.”</p><p>“You are exactly right, Nathaniel. You are such a smart boy. He would ask us to kill him. So the question is. Who will help this man tonight?”</p><p>Rose Mary and I looked at one another. Neither of us had ever held a gun, much less thought of killing a man. But it was without question the right thing to do. The animal that paced and growled before us would do much harm. Harm that the man inside of would be horrified at.</p><p>Rose Mary and I agreed to level our muskets at the same moment, thus neither of us could singularly feel guilty for killing the creature. And that is what we did. Father told us that only a silver bullet would kill the animal. As much as I was saddened about our act, it was the right thing to do.</p><p>I recall that story because that animal was a man beneath. And it is always an awful thing to kill a man. But there is a greater good to be served. As I go into the fight tonight with my own two sons by my side I will tell them that story, because it’s with a heavy heart that I know there will be lives lost. We must kill the witches, or we ourselves will be killed. Though they are most undoubtedly human, they are evil. And we must eradicate them.</p><p>I consider myself a most lucky man for having lived the life I have. I found a most loving and wonderful wife early in my life and my three children are my ultimate joy. This hard and sometimes lonely life of hunting would be intolerable if it wasn’t for them.</p><p>Dear family, if you are reading this, I’ve either lost my facilities or come to my end. Please remember that I love you all. I will meet you in heaven most surely.</p><p>Your father,</p><p>Nathaniel Campbell.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-three">CHAPTER THIRTY-THREE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-three" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>In loving memory of Nathaniel Campbell and Rose Mary Campbell, loving parents to Thomas, Caleb and Hannah.</p><p>My siblings and I thought it appropriate to close my father’s journal with the last entry relating his death. Perhaps later generations will be able to draw wisdom from his sacrifice. The remaining pages have been written by Thomas Campbell, age fifteen, Fall 1692.</p><p>The night that my brother Caleb and I broke my father out of jail, the village of Salem had turned to chaos. After my father confronted the magistrates and unveiled Prudence as a witch, most of residents went into hiding. Rightly so, for they had sat within a few feet of her for weeks, under her spell and believing every accusation she made. Upon discovery, Prudence fled. The night that followed would be the last night my father and mother spent in this corporeal realm. This is what happened.</p><p>Later that night, we retreated to our home. When we opened the door we realized that the witches had been there before us. Our mother had disappeared. She had set out our secret signal that something had gone wrong, so we knew that she had been either forcibly taken or was already dead. Our parents made up this signal for us when we were small children and they would go out hunting. If something bad happened, Father told us to turn over a tea cup and leave it on the kitchen table. That is what we saw when we entered the silent house. It was our mother’s sign to us.</p><p>My father was weakened from exhaustion and lack of food in prison but he wouldn’t stop to rest. He immediately pulled up the hidden door set underneath our kitchen table—built into the floor we had an arsenal for emergency use. Now was such an emergency.</p><p>We armed ourselves and forced my father to drink a warm cup of broth, then we set out for Constance’s property. We knew that Constance and Prudence were close to accomplishing a most evil task. So evil of a task that my brother and I hardly wanted to think of it. Raising the devil wasn’t something father had trained us against. Raising the devil would essentially make Hell on Earth. Both my brother and I knew that we must defeat the witches or risk losing the entire New World to evil.</p><p>Hannah made sure we were all warmly wrapped up and we left her behind, well armed, to guard our home. Father kissed her on the forehead before leaving.</p><p>“My dear girl,” he said, “you are the strongest, smartest young woman to walk the face of God’s great Earth. Do not ever change.”</p><p>A single tear streaked down Hannah’s cheek as though she already knew what was in store for my father.</p><p>“Don’t behave as though you will never see me again,” she said. “I’ll make sure there is a home for you to come back to.”</p><p>We took my father’s horse, our most sure-footed and silent. We would tie him up away from the fight in case one of us needed to flee or fetch help. Though I think we all knew there was no more help to get.</p><p>As we approached Constance’s residence, the lights of a hundred witches’ lanterns showed through the trees. Most of the figures were obscured behind a small knoll, so we could not see where our mother was. Father gave us the signal to wait. We sorted out our weapons on the damp ground. After a few minutes, the congregation of witches began to chant, their horrible voices building in strength and power as they continued.</p><p>Then a sound echoed through the woods which will be forever burned into my soul: my mother’s screams.</p><p>We grabbed our guns and crawled up the hill on our stomachs. Down below was a most horrific sight. A hundred witches chanted in unison, most no more than resurrected bodies of rotting flesh and bone. These putrid, wretched beings were now animated living things once again. Their voices were pitched low and threatening, and the noise continued to build, until our heads felt full of the horrible sound.</p><p>The witches moved around a great fire built in the shape of a ring. Inside the ring a hole was filled with perfectly round rocks. In front of the fire a large platform had been erected. This is where my poor mother kneeled. I knew she was scared. As proficient a hunter as she may be, no one could face down a hundred witches and not fear for her life.</p><p>Terror washed over my father’s face. There were many more witches than we had previously thought, the resurrections more numerous than we could ever have imagined. There must have been many more murders than we had discovered. All those people, including poor Abigail Faulkner, had been used as sacrifices for these resurrections.</p><p>I thought about the innocent people that the magistrates had sent to the gallows. They were not among the witches. The accused were all good, God-fearing, innocent members of the church, yet they had been put to death.</p><p>At that moment, two more witches appeared out of the woods dragging the body of a man. He seemed to be alive. Closer inspection revealed it to be Reverend Parris. The witches brought him to face a witch who was dressed in ceremonial garb. As she turned her head, I saw with a shiver that it was Prudence. She shot out her arm and lifted his petrified face to hers. The chanting halted and her sneering voice carried to our ears through the still night air.</p><p>“Why Reverend, why are you so scared? It is I, innocent little Prudence. Perhaps my station takes you as a bit of surprise. But you didn’t really think all those innocent people were really witches did you? Well I suppose you did. But it had to be done. You would surely have paid much too much attention to the dead bodies popping up around Salem Village if we hadn’t created another antagonist for you to concentrate your foolish beliefs. You sir, and I say this having known my fair share of men of God, are a pitiful, greedy human being. The kind of man who doesn’t deserve the respect of anyone.”</p><p>Reverend Parris cried out like an infant.</p><p>“Why have you brought me here? I am not one of your evil clan.”</p><p>Prudence smiled. “But you are, Reverend. You blindly followed a group of hysterical children, and you used them to do your bidding. One by one you eradicated your enemies.”</p><p>“I don’t know what you speak of,” the Reverend moaned.</p><p>“Tsk, tsk, Reverend. Of course you do. Don’t you remember the nights you spent with your sweet little niece by the fire? Where you would placidly recount who you thought might be practicing witchcraft? What impressionable young woman wouldn’t want to please you. Especially one so easily swayed. That is how you made sure everyone in the village with whom you had a disagreement was jailed or hanged.”</p><p>“That’s not true! I’m not what you say,” the Reverend cried.</p><p>“Don’t try to deny it, Reverend. Make your peace with God, this will be your last night on Earth. You’ll be meeting Him soon enough.”</p><p>With that she flicked her hand and the Reverend flew up in the air. He landed on the ground some distance away with his leg at a most unnatural angle. He cried out in pain. But Prudence ignored him, turning her attention instead to our mother. Mother was silent, but I knew she was afraid.</p><p>My father turned to Caleb and I.</p><p>“Boys, we will surely be outnumbered. We are but three against a hundred powerful wtiches. You must go ask for King Philip’s help. We need more men. Unfortunately we didn’t part on good terms last we spoke but try to convince him of our need. If we don’t stop the witches, our world as well as Philip’s tribe and way of life will be endangered. The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> could destroy the entire world. Please get him and his men. They <span class="italic">must</span> come.”</p><p>Caleb and I nodded. We knew the Wampanoag Indians were fierce warriors, they had killed many colonists from Boston to the territories north. Caleb and I had never traveled east to their land; moreover, we had never gone such a distance alone. King Philip had fostered a friendship with Father and he had always come to our house. The thought of a long, hurried journey on horseback through the night was daunting but the moonlight would light our way.</p><p>We said goodbye to Father, slid back down the hill and silently slipped away. We led the horse for a mile over the meadow so our retreat wouldn’t be heard by the witches. Riding tandem, we escaped east.</p><p>We rode hard, crossing dark fields and still darker woodlands. We crossed over a series of streams and soon came to a cliff that led down to a river. Beyond the water lay the woods that bordered King Philip’s territory.</p><p>We crossed the river at a shallow point, keeping our legs raised clear of the rushing water. By necessity we made a disturbance, and as soon as we got to the other side we knew that one of Philip’s scouts had seen us. Within a mile, we came to a clearing and found ourselves surrounded by Wampanoag Indians. These men were fierce, proud people and when they moved you could see their power and skill. We dismounted and waited, soothing our agitated horse and soon King Philip came forward.</p><p>I approached him respectfully.</p><p>“Please accept our humble apologies for arriving without invitation. But my father, your friend, Nathaniel Campbell, urgently needs your help and that of your men.”</p><p>King Philip was a most handsome man, tall, powerful. He ran his nation deftly and had the skills of any colonist negotiator. I didn’t know whether I would be able to convince him to help. Any fifteen-year-old would have been nervous, and I was shaking in my boots.</p><p>“Why should I put my men at risk? Your father is a most kind and learned man, but I cannot lead my men into a battle which doesn’t concern them,” he said.</p><p>I thought for a moment. I wasn’t sure what my response should be. He was right, of course—why should he put his men in danger? I knew I had to be cunning without being defensive or impolite.</p><p>“Gracious King, there are witches in Salem who are conspiring to open up the gates to Hell—they are trying to summon the devil. If they succeed, the evil will spread past the boundaries of our colony to you and your people. Your men would be drawn into a fight with the creatures of Hell. The witches will not heed the river which is a barrier between your nation and our colony.”</p><p>“Your Christian gods do not frighten us, we have our own protector spirits,” King Philip replied.</p><p>“I’m very respectful of them,” I said, “as is my father. However, the evil that will unfurl over this land will be too great for even your most powerful protectors. I understand caution. My father speaks of it often. But in this is not the time for prudence, this is a time for action. I beg of you to lend us some of your men.”</p><p>“You do not require my presence?” King Philip asked.</p><p>“We would like nothing more, for you are a powerful warrior, but my father wouldn’t think of asking you to put yourself at risk. You have a great nation to run.”</p><p>King Philip thought for a moment.</p><p>“I always appreciate a courteous word from a colonist, but I must refuse your plea. My nation and its safety is the most important thing and I cannot lead them into peril.”</p><p>I nodded respectfully. What else could I do? Caleb opened his mouth to protest, but I shot him a look to silence him. We bowed and received a gift of fresh water in a skin from King Philip’s wife, and then we left. Once we were out of earshot, Caleb began to weep.</p><p>“Stop that,” I said. “We will find a way to defeat the witches. But not if you have such soft resolve.”</p><p>Caleb wiped away his tears and we dug our heels into the horse’s sides to push it forward and back into the river. That’s when we heard the pounding of hooves from behind us. King Philip had allowed his men to fight. They came in full warrior regalia. Caleb and I were filled with hope and we gave them our thanks. They followed us back across the river.</p><p>It was another hour at full gallop to reach the village and then ten minutes to get to the edge of Constance’s lands. We dismounted a mile away and led the horses closer. The Indian horses were well trained and didn’t make a sound as we approached.</p><p>My father saw us coming and came to meet us. He greeted the men’s leader, who was King Philip’s brother, and together through gestures—for the brother did not speak English—they made plans. The Indians would circle the witches while my father created a diversion, and with guns drawn Caleb and I would free our mother.</p><p>The Indians moved off silently to take their places.</p><p>When I peeked back over the knoll a most unsettling sight lay before me. My mother had been led down to the ring of fire, and the witches encircled her, their voices louder than ever. Constance led the crescendo of chanting, calling upon the four Princes of Hell to rise.</p><p>The first she called forth was Belial.</p><p>Seeing the dire situation before us, my father started the <span class="italic">attack</span> with swift signal to King Philip’s men.</p><p>Moments later, the Indians emerged from the woods. The orange firelight illuminated their painted brown-skinned bodies and they looked like other-worldly warriors. In an explosion of action, they attacked the witches, their large sticks and spears impaling and beheading the enemy in turn. Muskets were drawn and bullets flew.</p><p>Seizing our moment, in the midst of the chaos, Caleb and I ran down the hill, stumbling and tripping toward the fire. It seemed the resurrected witches were easily brought down with a musket shot to the head or a quick stab through the heart.</p><p>However, Prudence and Constance proved to be much harder to defeat.</p><p>When Caleb and I reached the bottom of the hill, Prudence attacked us from the left. Caleb pulled back his musket to shoot, but she grabbed it and flung it into the fire. It landed on the rocks with a clatter. She flew at Caleb and caught him by the neck. He was thrown down with such force that his body made a mark in the earth.</p><p>Grasping a burning log from the fire, I swung it at Prudence’s head from behind. She flipped over to face me, somehow unhurt, and flinging the log from my hands, she encircled my neck with her fingers. I fought to breathe, realizing as I choked that my adversary must be weaker than she had been, since she was using physical force for her attack rather than spells or the black arts. It seemed most of her energy had been sucked away by the resurrection still taking place a few feet from our fight.</p><p>From the corner of my eye I could see my mother struggling against Constance’s powerful grip as she held her over a large brass bowl. The fire glinted off a large knife that the tall witch brandished in her other hand. Just as she raised her arm to strike, my father attacked Constance from behind. Constance let go of Mother and she fell into the edge of the fire. She rolled away but was unable to get up, as her hands and feet were tied. I struggled harder against Prudence, desperate to warn my mother of the approaching danger, but the witch was still too strong and I watched in horror as another old woman caught my mother by the nape of the neck.</p><p>This new woman seemed more powerful than the other resurrected witches. She slung my mother over her shoulder with ease. She took Mother back to the brass bowl, and again held her over it.</p><p>With a wrench I momentarily freed myself from Prudence and managed a croaked scream, but Prudence gained footing and hit me on the side of the head, my vision blurred for a few seconds and she caught hold of me again.</p><p>Still battling Constance, my father reached out to my mother, but it was too late. The strong old witch picked up a knife. The <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> lay open at her side. She started to chant. I desperately fought Prudence but her grip only intensified. Caleb was surrounded by three witches and was unable to get off a shot. Another witch bore down on him and knocked him off balance. He swerved, catching his foot in one of the stones near the fire.</p><p>The old witch continued to chant from the book then she held the knife across my poor mother’s neck and slit the life out of her. My mother’s blood drained into the brass bowl and at that moment a deep rumbling echoed through the woods.</p><p>My father threw Constance off him and kneeled at my mother’s side. Her head slid to one side and my father pressed his face to her breast, the life drained from her dear, pure heart. My father grabbed the book from the old woman with one hand, with the other he drew his pistol and shot her between the eyes.</p><p>Constance was embroiled in a fight with one of the fierce Indian warriors, so with the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> in hand, Father moved away into the shadows. I knew that the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> held powerful spells, but it also held their reversals.</p><p>Suddenly the stones in the center of the ring of fire started to drop as if a deep hole had opened up beneath them. The rumbling grew louder, and the earth beneath our feet became warm. A blast of heat, far surpassing the sun on the hottest of any June day, emanated from the hole. The fire ring almost doused itself; the heat coming forth from the hole seemed hotter than fire.</p><p>I tried to roll away from Prudence but she held me fast.</p><p>King Philip’s Indian warriors, men of great resolve, stopped their fighting and stared at the hole. It hurt to look in the direction of the fiery pit, but no one could draw their eyes away from the figure that was slowly rising up from the earth.</p><p>Constance shook off her adversary.</p><p>“Belial, I call you forth,” she shouted. “I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth.” She repeated the chant over and over, her voice louder and louder. While the creature, with great horns, gradually dissolved into the shape of a man.</p><p>Constance caught one of her young farm hands by the arm, pulled him close, and, grabbing the knife, started to chant once again. I realized she was trying to raise the second Prince of Hell, whose name I knew to be Leviathan.</p><p>My father reappeared from the shadows. He was holding the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and had his own buck knife in his other hand.</p><p>“Evil, vile creature,” he cried out to Constance. His voice steady and true. “You will not succeed in creating Hell on Earth.”</p><p>Then he started to chant from the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span></p><p>“Oh god of dark and god of light. You are summoned no more. Hide your evilness in the cage from which you came, you are not wanted on this mortal plain. I forbade <span class="italic">vos of atrum pergo huic regnum. Vos es inconcessus ut ingredior inter lux lucis. Vos es inconcessus ut futurus in is terra. Vado tergum qua vos venit. Vado tergum ut vestri cage. Vos es non volo. Per vox of lux lucis quod filiolus of Olympus quod bonus verto tergum ut atrum.”</span></p><p>And with that my dear father took the knife and sliced his own neck. He fell into a heap, his blood mixed with my mother’s in the bowl.</p><p>An inhuman scream echoed forth from the creature in the middle of the fire. Frigid air pushed forth from all corners of the wood, extinguishing the fire, and the figure disappeared back into the hellish fire at its feet. The earth closed up and rocks tumbled back into their place, imprisoning the Prince of Hell back in his fiery domain.</p><p>With the beast’s disappearance the resurrected witches started to visibly lose energy, making them a lot easier to kill. Caleb extracted himself and beheaded a slew of the old bags of bones. I wrestled from Prudence’s now much weaker grasp and swung around ready to attack Constance, but she and Prudence retreated swiftly into the woods, disappearing from view. Two of the Indian warriors went after them, but they came back minutes later. The women had evaporated.</p><p>We rapidly executed the rest of the witches, and threw their bodies into the middle of the ring. We piled wood on top of them and re-set the fire. Leaving the bodies for others to find would serve no purpose except to frighten them. We had what we needed to end the frenzy within the village.</p><p>I approached the quivering figure of Reverend Parris. He attempted to stand but was unable. I helped him up, supported him back to one of the horses, then helped him mount. As he tried to walk away I held the reigns.</p><p>“Reverend Parris? What say you to what you saw this evening?” I asked.</p><p>“Young man, I can hardly believe my eyes. I must return home and pray about it,” he replied avoiding my direct gaze.</p><p>“That is not what I meant,” I said. “You will call off the witch trials now. You will petition for the release of every jailed innocent. Will you not?”</p><p>He nodded, still not looking at me.</p><p>“Let me hear you say it,” I said.</p><p>“I will do everything in my power to release the innocent and I will tell the magistrates that the afflicted girls have been healed by the hand of God. Salem Village no longer harbors Satan.”</p><p>“Very well, have a safe ride home,” I said. “You never know what might lurk in the shadows.”</p><p>A look of panic crossed the Reverend’s face. He rode unsteadily off across the meadow.</p><p>By this time the early morning light was illuminating the carnage before us. Caleb leaned over the bodies of our poor parents as he recited the Lord’s Prayer. I stood beside him and joined in. The Indians had made a litter from logs and pine boughs. We laid Mother and Father on it and covered them with a torn coat.</p><p>The warriors promised to tell King Philip of Nathaniel’s bravery. I thanked them for their fight. Without them we surely would have been defeated. The Indians then galloped off quickly, they didn’t want to be caught on colony land during daylight. And with that Caleb and I headed toward home carrying our deceased parents.</p><p>As we approached home, Hannah appeared at the door and came to meet us. As she neared us her face was stricken with both relief at our survival and grief for our parents. We brought them inside and prepared their bodies for burial. We wanted them to be interred on our homestead and not in the village cemetery.</p><p>Our hearts were heavy that night. But one thing was clear. Our father would want us to continue hunting the evil in this world. In the early dawn light Caleb and I spoke about it. We debated when and how to tell our sister who was asleep in the next room. I knew after I recounted this story she would understand why we had to leave Salem and seek out others in need of our help. Though I feared she would be lonely I knew it was essential for her to stay in Salem and see the Reverend kept all his promises.</p><p>I left her the following letter.</p><p>Dearest Hannah</p><p>When you wake, Caleb and I will be gone. I hope you understand that after tonight saying goodbye to you would too hard. But knowing your strength and wisdom you will understand why we needed to leave. After the fight with the Salem witches, Caleb and I realized that all the country villages and towns are being abused and attacked by the kinds of evil we know how to fight. It would be lovely and comfortable to stay with you here, to see you marry and have a family. It would be lovely and comfortable for Caleb and I to do the same. But we feel that would be wrong and selfish. The world outside Salem needs us.</p><p>Please understand that our choice was not an easy one. And leaving you alone perhaps was not what Mother and Father would have wanted. But I know you’ll agree that there is a greater good at work.</p><p>We hope that God grants you a long and happy life. If ever we come by this way again, please leave the light on for us. You will forever be in our hearts and prayers. Keep up on your Latin, you are the best scholar in the family.</p><p>God bless.</p><p>Your loving brothers,</p><p>Thomas and Caleb.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-four">CHAPTER THIRTY-FOUR</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-four" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Dean closed Nathaniel’s journal, there were no more entries. Constance was Connie, Dean was certain of that, and could Perry be Prudence, or was that taking things too far? Though there wasn’t an exact map in the journal, Dean was pretty sure Constance had occupied the same house all these years. He guessed that she must stay hidden for a couple of generations and every now and then, after a while had passed, she would return to public life. That way no one could grow suspicious of her longevity. It was sort of the perfect way to exist forever.</p><p>Now, after all this time, Connie once again had the opportunity to raise Lucifer and as much as it hurt him, Dean now saw that he couldn’t let her do it. Sam would be forever bound to a coven of witches and Dean could not unleash that evil upon the world. He had to find a way to stop them.</p><p>He watched Lisa and Ben sleeping soundly, both had dropped off fully clothed on the other bed. Dean had explained that now was not the time to get cushy. Hunters slept in their clothes as you never knew what might wake you up in the morning. The TV blared out late night infomercials. Dean got up and checked his wallet, a couple of towns over there was a twenty-four-hour hardware store. He would need some rope, more salt, just in case, and, of course, knives. Buying ammo was going to be a tad harder at this hour of the night, but he could figure that out later.</p><p>Dean left the motel room quietly, careful not to wake Lisa and Ben. He got into the truck, noting that the motel parking lot was empty except for a white van parked in the far corner. Dean started the ignition and pulled away.</p><p>Sam watched Dean pull away in that nasty truck from inside the white van. He could have followed his brother, but he knew he didn’t have to take care of him. The thing that he wanted to take care of was the fact that Prudence had a tail on him. On his way here a small two-door hatchback had made every turn Sam did, and was now parked across the street from the motel.</p><p>It wasn’t Prudence herself behind the wheel, but Sam was pretty sure he recognized the girl as one of the ones from the bookstore break-in. She was probably put in charge of tallying Sam’s every move to make sure he didn’t get in the way of the remaining resurrections.</p><p>The only thing on Sam’s mind was how to take the witches down. Whether they were human or not didn’t matter to him. He didn’t know where the witches were planning this resurrection. And he had to find out. He could waste a lot of shoe leather. Or he could deliver two of the last resurrections to the witches on a plate. Pulling transients over and killing them couldn’t be easy. Perhaps he would just force the witches’ hand.</p><p>Sam pulled a mask on over his head, took out his sawed-off and loaded it with just one bullet. He wouldn’t need to call Prudence; the girl across the street would do that for him. He got out of the van and braced himself in front of the motel door to Lisa and Ben’s room.</p><p>CRACKKK!</p><p>Sam’s foot splintered the door off the jamb. Inside the room, Lisa sat up quickly, eyes bulging with fear, but Sam slapped her across the face before she could start screaming. She rolled over the bottom of the bed. Ben stirred in his sleep, but stayed unconscious—Sam guessed that Dean had given him a sleeping pill.</p><p>Lisa crawled across the ground toward one of Dean’s bags. Sam, staying silent lest he give his identity away, pulled the bag out of her reach. He roughly flipped her over onto her stomach and tied her hands and feet together with zip lines.</p><p>“Wh-why are you doing this?” she cried. “Please, just take me, leave my son!”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer. He grabbed a balled-up T-shirt of Dean’s and stuffed it into her mouth. Next he rolled Ben onto his stomach and tied both his hands and feet together. Ben snored loudly, unaware that his de facto uncle was setting him up for a kidnapping.</p><p>Lisa continued to try to scream through her gag, but the noise was muffled and ineffective.</p><p>Sam’s entire set-up had taken less than two minutes. He headed back outside and closed the door behind him. He looked at the car across the street. The girl’s faint outline could be seen through the dark windows of her crappy car. She was peering at him as he emerged from the motel. Sam smiled. There was no way she wouldn’t be curious.</p><p>Sam got into his van, took off his mask and pulled out of the parking lot. He raced up the highway until he was out of sight of the girl’s car. Then he made a rapid U-turn, came back around, and parked in a donut shop parking lot facing the street.</p><p>About half a mile down the road, Sam spotted a figure racing across the four-lane highway and into the parking lot of the motel. It took about a minute for the girl to return. She ran back across the road and slid back into her car and pulled it around into the motel parking lot. Being a witch, Sam surmised that she would be strong enough to carry Lisa and Ben out of their motel room and into her hatchback.</p><p>Sam waited until he saw the car pull out. It headed toward him, north up the highway. He crouched down, but the van was indistinct enough among all the other vans in the donut shop car park that the girl drove past without noticing. A few seconds later, Sam pulled out and followed her, a safe ten car-lengths behind.</p><p>Sam guessed that the girl probably didn’t have time to ask her superiors about whether or not to bring the two victims home. She had acted on instinct and that was to Sam’s advantage. She would lead him right to the resurrection sight. He hoped he would be able to deal with the witches without getting Dean involved. Meanwhile Sam wouldn’t actually let the witches harm Lisa and Ben. That wasn’t the plan. The plan was to stop the witches and systematically kill them all. Sam glanced into the back of the van. It was chock full of enough explosives to rip a hole in the Lincoln Tunnel, except Sam was going to use it to stop a different kind of destruction.</p><p>Sam continued following the car as it turned onto Route 128 and headed north.</p><p>Dean got out of the van balancing a bag of donuts, two coffees for him and Lisa, and a hot chocolate for Ben. He thought they could have a quick breakfast and maybe then he would put them on a train back to Cicero. It would be easier and safer to wrap this up without them. He had already put them through enough.</p><p>Dean had no idea how he was going to stop the witches, he would make it up on the spot, like usual. The only thing he was hoping for was that the witches hadn’t picked up anymore transients. But he had taken care of that by calling Officer Wiggims and putting out an ABP on both Perry’s car, which he had seen earlier in the week, and whatever caravan of cars Connie owned. At least then Connie would find it a little more difficult to get around town.</p><p>The motel door was cracked open. Dean immediately put down his provisions and took out his gun.</p><p>“Lisa? Ben?” Dean called.</p><p>He kicked open what remained of the door, and through the dim light he could see that both beds were empty. A quick scan of the room told him that someone had been pulled off the bed, the coverlet was on the floor at the foot. And there was a little piece of plastic, the kind that sometimes pops off a plastic zip tie. Most police officers use them, but Dean didn’t believe they had been arrested.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle bag, noticing that it wasn’t where he left it. Instead it had been thrown into a corner, out of reach. On the table, a paper cup was turned upside down.</p><p>Months ago, when Dean and Lisa were talking about Dean’s childhood, he had shared the signal John Winchester had taught him when he and Sam were young. “If the shit goes down, try to turn a cup over on the table. It won’t look out of place to anyone but us,” John had said. Dean knew someone had taken Lisa and Ben. He ran out the door and into the motel lobby, but the bored young woman behind the counter hadn’t seen anything.</p><p>In the truck, Dean popped open his laptop, it seemed that Lisa’s cell phone had been disarmed. The last time it pinged off a cell phone tower was nineteen miles north of Salem, toward the shore. After that, someone had turned off the GPS in the town of Gloucester. He decided to start there.</p><p>Dean peeled into traffic. He desperately wanted to call Bobby for a little help, maybe he could do more legwork on tracking down the cell phone, but he didn’t have time. As he pulled onto Route 128 he noticed in his rear-view a black Escalade barreling down on him. Dean pushed the pedal to the floor, but the old truck only belched out a trickle more horsepower.</p><p>“Should’ve taken the Impala,” Dean muttered to himself.</p><p>The Escalade pulled out from behind him and into the adjacent lane of the highway. The large car then swerved deliberately into Dean’s driver’s side. Dean’s truck swerved onto the sandy side of the road, and fishtailed. Dean fought the heavy vehicle to regain control and then he righted himself back onto the road. But there was no way to outrun the newer vehicle.</p><p>The Escalade pulled in behind the truck and hit its bumper with a CRAAASSHH, jolting Dean into the steering wheel. Dean willed the truck forward and steeled himself for another hit. The Escalade came full force and lifted the truck’s back wheels off the road.</p><p>Seconds later, it crashed back down, the shocks gave way and Dean’s back absorbed a good amount of the jolt from the old bench truck seat.</p><p>Dean tried to swerve to escape another hit, but the Escalade was too quick, it rammed into the rear bumper of the truck and it spun around into oncoming traffic. Dean cut the wheel and bumped roughly back into the correct lane.</p><p>The Escalade came back again and surged forward, passing Dean. He craned his neck to get a look into the car, but couldn’t see past the tinted windows.</p><p>The black car cut him off again. Dean slowed down and desperately reached beside him for his duffle which had slid onto the floor. Keeping his eyes on the road, and one hand on the wheel, Dean felt for the strap, grasped it, and pulled the bag into his lap. He fished out his sawed-off and leaned out of the side window, aiming the gun at the back window of the Escalade. The driver hit the brakes, sending the car skidding to a stop. Dean jammed on his brakes in turn, and the old mechanism squealed in response.</p><p>He couldn’t stop in time and the truck hit the large car with such force that Dean’s chin almost reached the windshield. The truck teetered on the front two wheels, then crashed back down. It gave one last sputter and the radiator exploded.</p><p>Satisfied, the Escalade sped off.</p><p>Dean grabbed his duffle bag and got out of the truck, ignoring the other drivers honking at his sudden halt. He was battered and bruised and now more desperate than ever to find Lisa and Ben.</p><p>He knew he needed to keep heading north. On his right side he could feel the cool wind of a storm pushing in from the sea. He assumed if he kept walking forward eventually he’d come to a town. Just then, a large sixteen-wheeler slowed and stopped in front of him. Dean climbed onto the runner. The driver rolled down his window. He was a wizened old guy in a trucker’s cap, and bore a strong resemblance to Bobby.</p><p>“You need a lift?” he asked.</p><p>“Yeah, if you wouldn’t mind. Going to Gloucester,” Dean said.</p><p>“It’s not too far. Get in,” the truck driver groused.</p><p>A mile down the road Dean realized that he had left his laptop in the truck. He desperately tried to look up the address of the last ping of Lisa’s cell phone on his phone. But the site just indicated that the cell had somehow passed through town.</p><p>“What’s past Gloucester? Anything?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Well, there’s Rockport. It’s a little hoity-toity for the likes of you though,” the trucker replied.</p><p>“Actually, I think that might do,” Dean said.</p><p>“Suit yourself,” the driver said. “Mind if I put on the radio?”</p><p>The driver hit the AM button. A traffic report blared through. Then a serious-sounding newscaster repeated a warning that an Amber alert had been issued for a teenage girl last seen getting into a black Escalade. Dean realized that the witches, in a desperate attempt to get hold of a couple more bodies, had not only take Ben and Lisa but also a poor girl just out for a walk by the beach.</p><p>They pulled through Gloucester and after a few miles on the seafront road came to Rockport.</p><p>“Gotta let you off here,” the driver said.</p><p>Dean thanked him and hopped out of the truck cab. Rockport was a quaint small town pressing up against the rocky shore on the Atlantic Ocean. Dean looked around. Even though it was summer, with a storm coming in, there wasn’t much of a crowd. Off in the distance, dark clouds hugged the horizon and lightning illuminated large patches of water miles out to sea.</p><p>Dean pulled up his collar, made sure that Nathaniel’s journal was snug inside his jacket, and started walking. Around a bend in the road, he saw in the distance several large houses clinging to the side of the shore. Further past them, an enormous house perched on top of a hill. One side of the property was ringed with long rocky boulders that stretched into the sea.</p><p>Dean pulled out his binoculars and trained them on the property. Panning around the area, he noticed a dust cloud which was being kicked up by a black Escalade as it wound its way up the road to the house. Taking a deep breath, he resisted the urge to kick the road in frustration. Even if the witches were hiding out in that grand house on the hill, he still had to find a way to stop them. He needed to get inside the house and fast.</p><p>As the thunder rumbled ever closer, the street was rapidly emptying of tourists. Dean glanced around and his gaze quickly settled on an ancient-looking hatchback, not the kind of car likely to have a sophisticated alarm system fitted. As casually as he could manage under the circumstances, Dean sauntered to the car and swiftly broke in—a minute later he was on the move, tires squealing as he sped away.</p><p>He parked further down the hill, then made his way up a sandy path toward the large wrap around front porch. As his foot stepped on the porch a shot rang out. Dean whirled around to find Perry standing behind him with a large shotgun trained right at his head.</p><p>“Let’s not disturb the occupants,” she said inclining her head toward the front door of the house. “I would hate to drag more innocent people into this. I mean soon enough, <span class="italic">everyone</span> is going to be dragged into it. But why single anyone out?”</p><p>“This isn’t your place?” Dean asked.</p><p>“No, silly, why would we have a place out here?” Perry replied.</p><p>“Lisa’s cell phone?”</p><p>“Just dropped it into a garbage truck that happened to be going north. I needed to get you out of Salem. Connie’s orders. I was pissed, I admit. I’ve been taking her shit for hundreds of years. But I’ll get to the festivities soon enough. As will you. I’m thinking you will be a special guest of honor. Why don’t you walk over here? And no funny stuff, the gun is just for show, but I have no problem roughing you up like I did before. Walk toward me, hands behind your head.”</p><p>Dean did as he was told. Perry quickly tied his hands together, and then his feet.</p><p>“Get into the truck,” she said opening the door and pushing Dean headfirst into the large trunk. A cage-like feature had been wound across the back of the car, creating a barrier between the back trunk space and the seats.</p><p>“You must have a big dog,” Dean said.</p><p>“Not yet, but you know opening up Hell might come with some problems.”</p><p>“Like hellhounds.”</p><p>“Wow, you know your Hell, Dean,” Perry said. “But of course you do.”</p><p>Dean looked her in the eye.</p><p>“I’m going telling you right now—by the end of today—you’ll be dead and I’ll have killed you,” he said.</p><p>For a split second a shadow crossed the witch’s girlish face.</p><p>“I’m the man to do it,” Dean continued grimly. “Maybe no one else for a hundred years has known what they were up against with you. But I do. You’re going to die today. Trust me.”</p><p>Perry slammed the back door, hoisted herself into the driver’s seat and peeled out of the driveway.</p><p>Dean desperately tried to free his hands but he couldn’t reach into his front pocket. He was stuck. The only good thing about this situation was that he was getting what he wanted. He was being taken directly to Lisa and Ben.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-five">CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-five" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam followed the young witch as she drove west out of town. When she pulled off the main road and onto a residential street, Sam slowed, not wanting to follow too closely behind. She knew what he was driving after all. He watched the car take a long curve around a series of tall, brick, residential buildings that made up a planned community, dark woods loomed on the other side of the road.</p><p>The girl drove the vehicle around the side of the main building and down into an underground parking garage.</p><p>As he approached the main building, Sam noticed that there were a lot of people hanging around: teenagers loitering, old people sitting on benches in the shade of trees or buildings. He couldn’t help but think it was a strange place to have a witches’ gathering. Sam parked in the shadow of some trees in the far corner of the car park, pushed his sawed-off into the back of his jeans, and walked down the ramp leading into the underground parking garage.</p><p>The garage was about half full but the young witch’s car was nowhere to be found. Sam walked up and down each and every aisle, methodically checking license plates to make sure he hadn’t missed it. Then he caught sight of a wide steel door in the shape of a low arch on the far side of the garage.</p><p>Crouching down, Sam noticed a little brake fluid right under the door. This had to be from the jalopy the young witch was driving. Sam pushed against the door, it creaked open just enough for him to see that it was padlocked from the inside.</p><p>Sam scanned the cars, and noticed a truck with a “Handyman For Hire” sign on it. He peered into the back of the truck, and was pleased to see it was loaded with tools. Sam pulled out his sawed-off and with the butt of the gun broke the back window, stuck his arm inside and wrenched open the door. He rummaged in the truck bed until he found a pair of bolt cutters.</p><p>Armed with the cutters, he pushed on the steel doors again and jammed the bolt cutters in through the opening. The heavy chain broke with a loud CLAP, and fell to the ground with a clatter.</p><p>Sam slowly pushed open the steel door to reveal a low cavernous hallway. The space could fit about five cars, but only one was parked inside. The young witch’s. Shutting the door behind him he checked the car, quickly establishing that Lisa and Ben were no longer inside it.</p><p>Across the hallway was another wide door. But before he could approach it, Sam heard a noise. The roar of car engines coming from the parking garage. Sam crouched behind the young witch’s car, listening intently.</p><p>Footsteps approached the steel doors.</p><p>Sam looked up and spotted an old pipe that stretched across the ceiling. Gritting his teeth, he hoisted himself up and hung on with his hands and legs crossed.</p><p>Moments later, the steel doors creaked opened and two cars pulled in, one after the other. From his position on the pipe Sam couldn’t see how many people emerged from the cars, but several doors banged shut and the volume of chatter suggested five or six people, and they all sounded female. Knowing what a vulnerable position he was in, Sam willed them not to look up.</p><p>The noise level dropped as the women went through the second door and disappeared toward whatever lay beyond. Judging that the coast was clear, Sam untangled his grip on the pipe and dropped to the floor with a THUD.</p><p>“Well, what are you waiting for? Let’s go,” a voice said.</p><p>Sam spun around and came face to face with his grandfather.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Sam asked.</p><p>“What do you think I’m doing here? I’m making sure these bitches don’t actually succeed in raising the four Princes of Hell, particularly the guy who still wants to ride your hide. No need to thank me.”</p><p>“I don’t need your help. I can handle this alone,” Sam ground out.</p><p>“Yeah, I saw that. Nice bagging of the witch by the way. I mean I had my doubts about you, but I think that cinched the deal. I know things have changed since last time I was around, but I’m pretty sure coitus with a witch is frowned upon. If you needed to get laid that badly, son, I’m sure I could have arranged something”</p><p>Sam stood in silence, taking his grandfather’s verbal lashing without blinking an eye. <span class="italic">Whatever.</span> He just wanted to get to the fight. When Samuel paused for breath, Sam took his opportunity.</p><p>“Can we talk about this later?” he asked, indicating the door the witches had disappeared through. They were wasting valuable time. Time when he could be killing witches.</p><p>“Oh, we’re going to talk about it all right. I knew there was something wrong with you the moment I saw you. I don’t know what’s going on Sam, but once this is done with, we’re going to find out.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Sam said.</p><p>“No, son. I may have been dead, but my brain ain’t. Believe me, there is something off with you.”</p><p>The witches had shut the steel doors behind them before heading down the corridor and now a scratching sound came from the other side. Their argument immediately set aside, Samuel and Sam moved silently against opposite walls. Samuel leveled his gun. Sam turned his gun around, stock first. The door inched open. The small barrel of a pistol pushed through the opening. Sam nodded to his grandfather, Samuel swung the door open and Sam brutally bashed the stock of his gun into the perpetrator’s face.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-six">CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-six" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>“Where the hell are you taking me?” Dean demanded as he peeked over the back seat. Perry’s small frame was almost completely obscured by the large bucket seats.</p><p>“You’ll see,” she said.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, she pulled into a mall parking lot, parked and then got into the back seat.</p><p>“Hold on, let me get ready,” Perry said.</p><p>She pulled at her shirt collar tearing it, then to Dean’s bemusement she punched herself in the jaw. A large welt immediately formed on the side of her face.</p><p>“I bruise easily, sort of the price you pay for being over three hundred years old,” she said conversationally, smiling at Dean. He was gradually getting the point.</p><p>“Oh, one more thing,” Perry said as she opened up a door in the grate separating them. “Now be nice.”</p><p>“What are you going to do?” Dean asked.</p><p>She just smiled wickedly then took out a small vial of liquid. She grabbed Dean’s head with one hand and with the other pried his mouth open. He struggled against her, twisting his head back and forth but Perry had a grip like iron and he was powerless to stop her. She poured the liquid down his throat; he gagged and then swallowed instinctively. She released his head and instantly he fell back, feeling the paralysis spread through his body, until he was completely inert.</p><p>After a moment, seemingly satisfied, Perry crawled back into the back seat and shut the cage.</p><p>He heard the beeps as she dialed three digits into her cell phone. After a brief pause, she started to speak, her voice small and hesitant with a panicky edge.</p><p>“Yes, hello. My boyfriend... my boyfriend beat me up. I don’t know. One moment we where kissing and then he just got real rough. Yeah, he just went into the mall. I don’t know when he’ll be back. Can you come quick? Oh, thank you.” She gave the details of their location and then rang off.</p><p>“It will wear off by the time the police get here,” Perry said to Dean, her voice confident and gleeful again.</p><p>Just then the squeal of sirens erupted in the distance. Perry flicked her wrist and the binds on Dean’s legs and wrists immediately came off. She hopped out of the vehicle and popped open the back door.</p><p>“Whatcha’ gonna to do, Dean? Run and hide or face the music? Either way you’re not going to see your little GF and son ever again,” she gloated.</p><p>Dean swung his heavy legs onto the ground, stood up and tried to walk; it was a little more difficult than he remembered it being. He leaned on the side of the car, the sirens were getting closer.</p><p>“I’m going to kill you,” he croaked.</p><p>Perry pursed her lips as if seriously weighing that possibility.</p><p>“Eh, probably not. But you can always try. Here they come. Watch and learn, Dean, baby,” she purred.</p><p>A Salem Police squad car bumped into the parking lot and screeched around in a wide circle clearly trying to locate the emergency caller.</p><p>Pushing Perry out of his way, Dean took off in a Frankenstein-like run. He could still feel the paralyzing liquid coursing through his veins, and he had to will his stiff legs to keep moving. He headed for the tree line that ran down one side of the parking lot. He tripped and stumbled down into a ravine and splashed into a polluted little stream at the bottom. He could hear Perry’s screams coming from behind him, she was surely pointing his escape route out to the police.</p><p>A large drainage pipe led underneath a road, and Dean headed toward it hoping for a little refuge. Gritting his teeth through the stiffness, he stumbled through the pipe, his boots splashing through the fetid water, and emerged on the other side into a small run-off pond. He struggled to climb up the grassy slopes surrounding it, up and into a fast-food joint’s parking lot.</p><p>Not far from where Dean paused to catch his breath, a pudgy guy quickly exited his car on a burger run. Dean slid into the driver’s seat. He fumbled with a couple of wires underneath the dash, struggling with stiff fingers, but after a few seconds he touched them together. The spark egged the engine into jump-starting. Dean pulled swiftly out of the parking space. Checking his rearview mirror, he saw a couple of cops appear at the top of the grassy bank. He put his foot down and squealed out of the parking lot.</p><p>Dean bashed the steering wheel with his fists in frustration. He still didn’t know where Lisa and Ben were or what had happened to them—they could be dead by now. The witches’ latest sacrifices. He should never have brought them to Salem—what the hell had he been thinking? Family life and hunting just don’t mix. It was too dangerous. He had already lost Sam, what if he also lost Lisa and Ben?</p><p>He needed to figure out where the witches were. Trying to calm down and focus, Dean decided to head back to the library. He needed a map, an old one.</p><p>At the library the same old woman was at the desk. But minus his professorial clothes and clearly looking as rough as he felt, she looked at him much more skeptically.</p><p>“May I help you?” she asked.</p><p>“I’m looking for any old maps you might have of Salem?” Dean asked politely, trying to keep the edge of panic out of his voice.</p><p>“Everything we have can be found on the Internet if you go to—“</p><p>“Listen, I don’t have time for that,” he said urgently. “Where are the maps?”</p><p>She pointed to several large cabinets on the other side of the room. Dean nodded his thanks.</p><p>Aware of the woman’s eyes on him, he tried to be careful as he hurriedly pulled open each cabinet and riffled through the contents, painfully aware that he wasn’t sure exactly what he was looking for. Surely he’d know it when he saw it—he usually did. Then he noticed a modern map of the development plans for the Kirkbride Estates, where Perry had her apartment. It showed the series of buildings some of which had been demolished and some of which had been refurbished. His brain made a sudden connection and he went back to another map dating from 1786. It was the oldest the library had. Both the maps were to the same scale. He placed the older one, which clearly outlined old Salem Village, over the new one. Salem Village and the Kirkbride Estates lined up.</p><p>The circle in which the insane asylum and then the condos had been built was directly over what used to be Salem Village.</p><p>“So Salem Village was torn down?” he called over to the librarian.</p><p>“More or less,” she replied, “sure there are some buildings in Salem Town that date back to those days, and that were used during the witch trials, but Salem Village where the actual trials took place, those buildings were mostly demolished and left to rot. The insane asylum was built right tip-top on it.”</p><p>“Well ain’t that something.” Dean thanked the woman. Then he remembered something else. “Oh I need to see that Campbell journal again, if I could?”</p><p>She led him back to the reading room and produced the box in which Dean had left John’s journal, then left him alone.</p><p>Dean pulled the Campbell journal from his jacket and took one last look at it. His family came from a lineage of hunters who had always sacrificed themselves for the good of others. He only wished he could share his discovery with Sam.</p><p>He switched out the journals and left the library. But not without pocketing the last couple of pages of the Campbell journal. They were sort of his by rights, anyway.</p><p>Dean got back into his stolen car and headed to the Kirkbride Estates. He was going to have to do some real quick thinking since he was without guns or salt. He’d had to abandon his duffle bag when Perry pulled a gun on him back in Rockport.</p><p>As Dean pulled into the estate, he noticed something he hadn’t clocked the previous day, when he and Lisa had rescued Ben. A couple of kids were hanging around by the side of one of the buildings. A car approached and slowly came to a stop in front of them. One kid in a baseball cap leaned in through the passenger-side window, and something was passed between the driver and the kid. The kid nodded then went back to his friends. The car pulled away.</p><p>These kids were Salem drug dealers. <span class="italic">And where there were drugs, there were sure to be guns,</span> Dean mused. Thank God, Perry hadn’t found the wad of cash in his sock. Dean had never bought drugs; they were not something that was really worked with the hunter lifestyle. Hard liquor definitely, but drugs, not so much.</p><p>Dean stopped the car, but kept it idling in case he needed to get out quick. He tried his best swagger approaching the group of kids.</p><p>“You got a load in your pants, white boy?” one of the kids said.</p><p>Dean pushed down his pride.</p><p>“Listen man, I need to buy some shit from you.”</p><p>The boys laughed.</p><p>“You trippin’ if you think we’re going to sell to a plainclothes. Go back to Captain Crunch and tell him he ain’t catching us today,” the first kid said.</p><p>“I hate that fat freak,” Dean said. “I’m not working for anyone but myself, and I need some firepower like two minutes ago.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” another one of them spoke up. “What for? Hunting season hasn’t started yet.”</p><p>“Listen, I just need a sawed-off and if you have it, a couple pounds of salt, and anything you have that will blow up.”</p><p>The kids cracked up in his face.</p><p>His patience rapidly running out, Dean approached the closest heckler and elbowed him in the neck. As he fell, Dean pulled him up by the collar then dropped him at his feet. The kid writhed around in pain.</p><p>“Hey!” the first kid spoke again. “That some Schwarzenegger shit man. Why you do that to Tiny?”</p><p>“Because I’m not kidding and don’t have time for this crap,” Dean ground out. “What do you have? I have money and I need guns.”</p><p>“He for real,” a tall kid called from beside Dean’s idling stolen car. “Car’s hot.”</p><p>Dean looked back to the group of kids. The first kid stepped forward.</p><p>“You can go to prison for that shit you know,” he said.</p><p>“I’ve been to Hell. Try again,” Dean said.</p><p>“I believe this guy,” the kid said. “Okay, follow me. Just don’t wake up my Grams.”</p><p>Dean followed the kid in through a first-floor apartment door. Inside, an older black woman slept on the couch while the TV blared. The kid gestured for Dean to follow him into another room.</p><p>“I’m Tim by the way,” the kid said. He laid out two antique guns on his neatly made bed. “I got this and this,” he said, gesturing.</p><p>“Hey. I’m Dean. And no offence Tim but those are ancient,” Dean said disappointed. “I thought we were talking like real guns.”</p><p>“These are real guns. I only collect classics. This here dates back to the civil war. And this one before that.”</p><p>Dean didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Instead, he shrugged and picked up the guns. He examined them carefully. They seemed like they would do the job. He placed them back on the bed. Dean eyed Tim, and the pristine condition of his bedroom. He noticed a bookshelf was lined with astronomy textbooks.</p><p>“You seem like a smart kid,” Dean observed. “Why are you selling guns?”</p><p>Tim shrugged. “These are antiques man. I do a lot of research to find good hardware. You won’t need anything else but what you have in your hands.”</p><p>Dean reached crouched down and pulled up his jeans, pulling a wad of cash from his sock, along with a credit card. He counted out several notes, shoved the rest back into his sock, then handed the kid the cash and the credit card.</p><p>“Take this. It’s hot, but basically untraceable. I think it’s some big agent in Hollywood. Never checks his bills, so feel free to have fun.” He inclined his head toward the textbooks. “Get yourself something worthwhile.”</p><p>“Thanks, man,” Tim said, counting the money quickly and easily. He squinted at the credit card. “You can take this too.” He pulled out a small pistol. “I don’t know how much salt my Grams has in the kitchen, but you can just take what you need.”</p><p>Dean nodded his thanks, loaded the guns into his pockets and waistband. He then followed the boy into the kitchen where he loaded up on table salt.</p><p>Outside Dean offered up his hand to Tim.</p><p>“Thanks—you’ve really helped me out.”</p><p>“No problem. Hey—what you need the steel for?”</p><p>Dean eyed the group of young kids in baggie shorts and big T-shirts. Suddenly they all looked much younger and more vulnerable than they had first appeared. One thing about chasing monsters—makes your average human gang member seem like a pussycat.</p><p>“Basically, I think my girlfriend and her kid have been taken by some real bad bitches,” he replied. “And I think it’s all going to go down somewhere around here.”</p><p>“No shit. Well you know where to find us,” Tim said. “We just chillin’, so if you need extra bodies—“</p><p>Dean nodded in appreciation, then got back into the car and pulled around the corner to the Kirkbride Estates. He sat in the car for a short while, checking his weapons and loading them up. Then he got out and walked around the building.</p><p>He spied the parking garage and headed down the ramp. Under the strip lighting, Dean spread out the maps he had taken from the library on the hood of a car. He noticed that the development plans outlined the destruction of a large building in the center of the property, in its place a large swimming pool had been dug. But Dean noticed on the older map of Salem Village the very same space once was a fort built for raids against the Indians. The fort’s outer walls were much larger than the outline of the asylum building or the pool. Dean wondered if the fort somehow still existed.</p><p>A loud thump and muffled voices echoed through the parking structure. Sensing trouble, Dean searched the half-empty garage and noticed the steel doors on the other side of the lot. He grabbed the maps, shoving them back inside his jacket, took out the pistol and silently slipped past rows of cars to the doors. Inside he could hear muffled voices.</p><p>Dean pushed the steel door open an inch. He stuck the pistol barrel through the opening. The next thing he knew the door was swung open and the butt of a gun cracked his nose with a THWACK! Stars exploded in his eyes and Dean fell onto the cement floor.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-seven">CHAPTER THIRTY-SEVEN</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-seven" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Sam and Samuel looked at Dean passed out at their feet.</p><p>“Now what are we supposed to do?” Samuel asked.</p><p>“Lisa and Ben are in there somewhere,” Sam said.</p><p>“We can’t waltz in there and save them—they’ll shit their pants,” Samuel pointed out.</p><p>“I can’t. But you can. They don’t know who you are.”</p><p>“Sam, I don’t think you understand the gravity of the issue here. There are—I don’t know how many witches in there, one man can’t do anything. I don’t even know what Dean was thinking. He’d get skinned alive. You can’t let him go in alone.”</p><p>Sam looked down at his older brother. Blood trickled from his nose onto the cement.</p><p>“We can’t leave him here,” Samuel went on. “They’ll find him. We need to wake him up.”</p><p>Two minutes later they had opened up a BMW, hot-wired the engine and placed Dean in the front seat. They set all the air conditioning vents toward his face, and blasted the cold air at him. Sam poured a bottle of water over Dean’s head.</p><p>They then retreated back through the steel doors and opened the second door on the other side of the hallway, stepping into a musty-smelling tunnel with a packed dirt floor, and brick archways that reached across the low ceiling. Stale air washed over them from the dark depths further down the tunnel. Samuel pulled a flashlight from his jacket and Sam led with his gun. As they moved forward, the tunnel seemed to drop downhill, deep into the earth. Sam estimated that they were directly underneath the large brick building. He looked at his cell phone, there was absolutely no reception.</p><p>They crept forward in the darkness, until around a corner the tunnel opened up into a large underground cavern. Lamps hung from the ceiling and a crowd of witches was gathered in the middle of the space. They all moved with purpose as though each had been assigned a task. They seemed to be constructing something.</p><p>Aware of their exposed position, Sam looked round for a better hiding place. He noticed a narrow passageway built into the thick walls that seemed to cut through toward the main cavern. It looked like the vestiges of another old passageway system. Sam and Samuel squeezed through the narrow gap. They shuffled down the tunnel until they came to a small opening cut into the wall which allowed them to see into the large cavern.</p><p>“I don’t see Lisa or Ben,” Samuel whispered.</p><p>Sam didn’t respond, because he had spotted Prudence. She stood slightly apart from the rest of the witches, who witches were gathered in a circle. A tall woman stood on a platform. She was chanting from a small book.</p><p>“That’s it,” Samuel said. “That’s the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> We can’t let her get through the entire spell.”</p><p>Sam didn’t answer.</p><p>“Sam, are you listening?” Samuel hissed.</p><p>Sam glared his grandfather.</p><p>“Yes, I get it. We can’t let them finish.”</p><p>Sam stared at the book in the tall witch’s hands. What he couldn’t tell his grandfather was that he didn’t care. If Lucifer took back control over his body in some ways he would welcome it. When Lucifer was in him, for the couple days before he fell into the pit, Sam had never felt so powerful. Lucifer was so strong that being filled up by him completely obliterated any need to care about or love anything. The feeling of literally being able to rule the world was exquisite. Addictive. No other human being on earth had ever felt what Sam had.</p><p>For that reason, in some ways, he would welcome that feeling again. Being squished into a dirt-packed hole underground with his cranky once-dead grandfather, waiting for his heartbroken and desperate brother to come and stop a bunch of witches from resurrecting Lucifer... wasn’t one of Sam’s favorite moments.</p><p>Dean awoke wet and cold with his head pounding. He opened his eyes and clocked the unfamiliar dash of an unfamiliar car. There was a knock on the window. Dean turned and looked into the face of an extremely angry-looking man clutching a computer case and a suit jacket.</p><p>“Hey you, junkie. Get the hell out of my car,” the man yelled. He wrenched open the door and pulled Dean out of his seat by his collar.</p><p>Dean stumbled and fell into the vehicle in the adjacent space.</p><p>“I don’t know why management doesn’t take care of the trash like you,” the guy spat. He got into the driver’s seat and slammed his door, then screeched out of the parking lot.</p><p>Dean noticed his reflection in the dark window of the mini van he was leaning against. His bruised nose was developing a hideous purplish welt. He had no idea what had happened, but since he was still alive, Dean thought it best to move forward. He checked his guns, they were all still there, still working.</p><p>This time, he was slightly more cautious as he pushed open the steel doors. Inside, several cars were parked. Dean instantly recognized Perry’s. He made sure that no one else was hiding in the room, then he passed through the opposite door and into a damp underground tunnel.</p><p>The tunnel was dangerous, there was nowhere to hide if anyone approached from behind or in front of him. Only the darkness would obscure him. In the distance he could hear the murmuring of voices. Dean crept forward down the sloping dark tunnel.</p><p>After what felt like the length of two football fields, the tunnel turned a corner and Dean smelled smoke and found himself looking into a deep cavern and a crowd of witches all chanting in unison.</p><p>The figures, all clad in black, encircled a large bonfire. He could see Connie standing on a platform. She was leading the chant from the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> Perry stood to the side. <span class="italic">She must have fobbed off the cops and then come straight here,</span> he figured. Lisa and Ben must be somewhere nearby though he couldn’t see them.</p><p>The bonfire smoke curled up toward the vaulted stone ceiling. Dean estimated the ceiling was about two stories tall but who knew how far underground they were. It would be pretty impossible to mount a large-scale attack from above. Plus, Dean was pretty sure they were almost directly underneath the large community pool.</p><p>He looked around the hallway, which was built large enough for a horse cart. Dean had an idea and ran back up the tunnel.</p><p>Inside the smoky cavern Lisa and Ben were shackled to the stone wall. Ben whimpered in fear. Lisa tried to soothe her son, but she could only move her hands enough to touch the tips of Ben’s sweaty fingers.</p><p>“Shush, Ben. It’s going to be okay,” Lisa whispered.</p><p>“I never should have gotten that second helping of fries. Perry is evil.”</p><p>“This isn’t your fault, Ben. None of this is your fault. We’re going to find a way out of this. I promise.”</p><p>“How? Where’s Dean?” Ben demanded.</p><p>“He’s coming, honey. He’s coming,” Lisa said, hoping that she was right.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Dean retreated back to the low-ceilinged hallway where Perry’s car was parked. He opened up the back of the car and was relieved to find his duffle. He got out his two sawed-offs, made sure they had real bullets in them and then opened up the steel doors leading back into the parking lot. He hopped into the driver’s seat of Perry’s car, swiftly got the engine going and backed the Escalade into the parking lot. He laid the condo development plans on the seat beside him, tracing the route until he found the building he was looking for.</p><p>His headache was receding and he felt a new burst of energy now that he had a plan. Dean accelerated out of the parking lot and headed to the maintenance building. He maneuvered the Escalade up to the garage doors. Inside he found entire barrels of fertilizer, gas and other chemicals—all the gear the maintenance crew needed to keep up the grounds, stacked right up to the ceiling.</p><p>Thanking God it wasn’t kill-the-weeds day so the place was deserted, Dean hastened to load the large cans of gas and sacks of fertilizer into the back of the car. Then he swung the car back around and retreated with his bounty back to the parking garage.</p><p>Dean drove through the first set of steel doors and then opened up the second set of doors leading to the underground tunnel. Hoping his estimations were correct, he flicked on his headlights, gunned the engine and floored it through the doors.</p><p>The tires hit the dirt floor of the tunnel and threw the car forward. The tunnel flew by. Dean steeled himself for the turn—the dirt walls didn’t afford him any room for mistakes. Mere seconds flew by. Dean held his breath then cut the wheel.</p><p>The back wheels fishtailed, and then bumped the truck forward. Dean gripped the steering wheel, punched the accelerator and bombed into the cavern and straight into the crowd of witches.</p><p>He stamped on the brakes before he drove into the bonfire. A cacophony of screaming witches shook the cavern. Dean pulled himself out through the sunroof and stood on top of the car. He started shooting.</p><p>The women flew at the car, old and young alike they attacked, lips peeled back as they snarled angrily. Dean blew away body after body.</p><p>Constance had stopped chanting and stood on her platform scowling. Three of her burly farm hands approached the car, Dean got one shot off before they grabbed him by the foot and pulled him off the roof. The six-foot drop landed him on his back.</p><p>Constance stepped off her platform and walked over to Dean. She towered over him.</p><p>“I’m not into this whole two girls one cup angle, could you maybe move?” Dean said.</p><p>Constance kicked him in the ribs. Dean rolled over and blood dribbled out of his mouth.</p><p>“I don’t find you funny,” she said. “But I’m delighted you’re here. It is very appropriate that a descendant of those who ruined my quest the first time, will be sacrificed when I succeed this time.”</p><p>Dean struggled onto all fours, spitting blood, and looked up at Constance.</p><p>“I don’t know what kind of junk you’ve been smoking,” he croaked, “but raising Lucifer is just about the worst idea I’ve ever heard. Trust me.”</p><p>“I didn’t ask for your opinion. All I need is your blood. Tie him up with the others,” Constance instructed.</p><p>The burly guys dragged Dean by the feet into a corner where he saw to his relief that Lisa and Ben were shackled. They might be prisoners but they were still alive and apparently unhurt.</p><p>Lisa glared at Dean.</p><p>“This was your idea of a rescue?” Lisa said. “To drive into a cave full of witches without any backup?”</p><p>“I didn’t have much of choice, Lisa. Sort of light on brothers to back me up. It’s not like I can go out and hire anyone to help,” Dean replied.</p><p>The burly guys finished shackling Dean to the wall, then walked away.</p><p>“It’s fine anyway, I have an idea,” Dean said, trying to sound confident.</p><p>“I’m not feeling so fine,” Lisa said.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-eight">CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-eight" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Constance stepped to the edge of the platform and hushed the gathering. She raised her hands up in supplication and began to speak. Her ice-cold voice echoed loud and clear around the walls.</p><p>“To all my sisters, we have waited years. The time is nigh. Our great Princes will rise up and under our power create the world in their image. Darkness will reign. No longer will we have to live in the shadows. Sisters, since we came to this land we have suffered and cowered in the corners. Never gaining the respect or the resplendence we are due. After three hundred years the alignment is clear. Sixty-six seals were broken and though the Prince of the South was returned to the underworld—his resurrection is imminent. We will finally have the dark power to create a New World in which we can live freely without the reigns of the light and the Godly. As we go forth, spread the darkness before you like seeds, dear sisters. We are the chosen queens of darkness. The power is ours for the taking. We are the spouses of the Four Princes, and they will do our bidding and build the world of dark, crushing the light. Bring forth the first sacrifice.”</p><p>A scream echoed through the cavern. A young girl, presumably the one from the Amber alert Dean had heard on the trucker’s radio, was dragged up to the platform. Constance began her chant one again. With one hand she brought out a long knife, with the other she held the neck of the girl over a large brass bowl.</p><p>“Close your eyes, Ben,” Dean said. “Now.”</p><p>Ben squeezed his eyes shut. The girl continued to scream.</p><p>The rest of the witches joined in the chanting, louder this time, their voices echoed off the walls so the noise was unbearable.</p><p>Dean tried to move closer to Ben as the boy started to visibly shake with fear. Dean looked at Lisa and saw her eyes were full of tears. The guilt squeezed his chest—how could he have let this happen?</p><p>Constance shouted over the chanting and the girl’s hysterical screams.</p><p>“We call forth the Four Princes of the Darkness. The rulers of Hell, the sons of darkness. Rise up from your unearthly shackles. We call forth and command you to rise. We call all the forces of darkness to rise. To the prince of the North, Belial, I command you to rise. I invoke thee. I summon thee. I conjure thee. With this life blood, manifest thyself. With this sacrifice, manifest thyself. Come forth, Belial. Come forth, Belial.”</p><p>The girl fought like a young goat, but Constance held her firmly by the nape of the neck and in one deft cut she slit the girl’s throat from side to side. Lisa whimpered and buried her head in her chest.</p><p>Constance held the dead girl’s hair, the body plunged forward and blood poured from the gaping neck wound into the bowl. A dark-red drop splashed up across the lip.</p><p>Constance started to shout.</p><p>“Belial, I call you forth. I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth.”</p><p>There was a rumble from all sides of the cavern. Small pebbles shook loose from the ceiling.</p><p>“What’s happening, Dean? What did she mean by the princes of darkness? Is that Lucifer?” Lisa whispered.</p><p>Dean looked at her.</p><p>“Is that why we’re here? Were you going to try and do this? Raise Lucifer to get Sam back?” Lisa’s eyes were wide with fear and disbelief.</p><p>“It crossed my mind,” Dean admitted.</p><p>“Are you crazy? I know you miss Sam, but were you really prepared to do <span class="italic">this</span>?”</p><p>“I had no idea it meant sacrificing people—I would never do that. You know that, don’t you?”</p><p>Lisa turned her head away from him.</p><p>“I don’t know anything anymore, Dean. I’m so scared I can’t think.”</p><p>Another great groan emanated from the ground. Belial was slowly rising up. They needed to get out of there.</p><p>“Trust me, please, baby. It’s going to be fine. I’ll get us out of here—I promise,” Dean said.</p><p>Just then two of the burly guys walked over. One grabbed Lisa by the waist and pulled her up, as the second struggled to unlock the ancient iron shackles that held her feet and ankles. Lisa started screaming, she kicked her legs and struggled to escape.</p><p>“Mum!” Ben called as he tried to pull free of his bonds.</p><p>“Leave her alone,” Dean growled at the men. “Take me instead.” But the guys ignored him.</p><p>Lisa spat and fought, she pulled her leg back and managed to kick one of the guys in the nuts. The guy doubled over. Neither of the attackers noticed as a small key dropped to the dusty cavern floor. The guys pulled Lisa away.</p><p>Dean looked at the key and looked at Ben. The boy’s eyes were full of terror but he wasn’t hysterical. He understood Dean’s meaning straight away and placed his sneaker over the key.</p><p>“Can you get it over to me?” Dean whispered.</p><p>Ben steadily wrapped his sneakers around the small object and pushed it toward Dean’s hands. Dean felt the tip of Ben’s sneakers, then the cool metal of the key. He pulled one hand through the shackles as much as he could, then twisted his hand with the key into the keyhole of the opposite shackle. The iron clap unlatched with a soft click. Dean threw a glance in the direction the men had taken Lisa, he saw she was still fighting. Dean undid the other shackle, then his feet. No one was looking at them—all eyes were on Constance.</p><p>Dean shuffled over until he was beside Ben. He quickly undid the boy’s shackles. Dean looked around—how was he going to get them out of here unharmed? In the corner Dean spotted a nasty, ripped old dress. Dean crawled over to it and brought it back to Ben.</p><p>“Put this on. Quickly,” Dean directed.</p><p>“I don’t want to put on a dress,” Ben said.</p><p>“Just put it on,” Dean insisted, eyes flicking back and forth to make sure no one was looking at them. Ben pulled the dress on over his T-shirt. “Put this on, too.” Dean handed him a bonnet he had also retrieved. Ben begrudgingly put on the bonnet.</p><p>They stood up slowly and carefully, Dean’s gaze taking in the whole room. But the commotion in the center of the cavern was drawing everyone’s attention and they began to move slowly and silently toward the corridor.</p><p>“Hold my hands like they’re still shackled,” Dean murmured. “When we get near the opening, let me go and then I need you to do something for me.”</p><p>“What about Mom?” Ben asked.</p><p>“Don’t worry—I’ll take care of her,” Dean replied.</p><p>The chanting continued. In the center of the bonfire the earth below had started to give way again.</p><p>Dean saw that Lisa was being forced onto Constance’s podium. He didn’t have much time. He eyed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> at the tall witch’s side. She was still giving directions to her underlings.</p><p>Dean whispered instructions to Ben, still dressed in the filthy dress and bonnet. If you weren’t looking carefully, he could have been one of the witches. Dean waited a moment.</p><p>“Okay, now,” he said.</p><p>Ben let go of Dean, and walked toward the podium. His hand shook as he reached out and grabbed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> that lay near the dead young girl’s head. He flinched at her dead eyes, that were looking upwards right at him.</p><p>“You girl, bring me that book,” Constance said spinning around to face Ben. “Don’t dawdle, give me that book.”</p><p>Ben grabbed the book and approached her.</p><p>“Give it here,” Constance directed. Ben stepped toward her, but misjudged the uneven dirt floor, he tripped landing on all fours. “Oh you stupid child, can’t seem to resurrect a competent witch these days,” Constance said.</p><p>Ben struggled to get up. He rearranged his “skirts” then drew himself up before Constance. He held out the book for her. She grabbed it and stuck it under her arm. Then she directed the two burly men to bring Lisa to her. Ben swung around on his heel and walked in the direction of the door. The Escalade still stood inside the entrance. As Ben walked past Dean he handed the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> to him.</p><p>“Good job, now get out of here,” Dean whispered.</p><p>Ben nodded and walked into tunnel. The darkness swallowed him.</p><p>He made it five feet into the tunnel when two young girls appeared out of the darkness.</p><p>“Where are you going, girl?” one of them asked.</p><p>Ben hid his head and shrugged.</p><p>“These old witches are weird. Do they even speak English?” the other one said.</p><p>“I don’t know,” the first one replied. “But she shouldn’t be leaving. Keep her here. I’ll go ask.” The first girl walked into the cavern, the other watched her.</p><p>Ben was about to flee, when someone grabbed him by the arm.</p><p>Ben struggled against his abductor until the guy turned him around and gestured for him to be quiet. He had pulled him into the side tunnel off the main corridor. Ben couldn’t see much but he could tell this guy was old, bald, and definitely not a witch.</p><p>“I’m going to get you out of here,” the man hissed. “Follow me.”</p><p>Not having an alternative, Ben did as he was told and followed the old guy. They ran up a long, dark tunnel, through two sets of doors and out into a parking structure.</p><p>There they paused to catch their breath. Then the old guy bent down and spoke to Ben.</p><p>“I want you to go back above ground. And no matter what you do, do not come down here again. You understand me?”</p><p>Ben nodded. “Who are you?”</p><p>“Friend of Dean’s. Now go,” the man said sternly. Ben wasn’t going to be told twice. He ran up the ramp and out of the parking garage to the lawn outside. There he plopped down on the grass, still trying to catch his breath. He looked down at his improvised disguise and then quickly tore off his dress and bonnet.</p><p>“What the hell are you?” a voice said.</p><p>Ben swiveled round. A gang of boys stepped forward and encircled Ben. They were much bigger than Ben, and though he’d been bullied a couple times on the playground, Ben knew he was being confronted by a group with a lot more street cred.</p><p>“We haven’t seen you around here before. You know you gotta ask permission before coming outside, right.” one of them said.</p><p>In the last six hours Ben’s skin had grown a tad thicker than it had been before.</p><p>“Dude, leave me alone. There’s some shit going down and I really don’t need your crap too.”</p><p>“Hey, you know some white guy, Dean, came here looking for trouble round here?” an older kid said, stepping forward.</p><p>“Yeah, Dean’s my mom’s boyfriend. He’s down there,” Ben said pointing to the parking garage.</p><p>“Where? Down in that locked cavern shit?” another kid said.</p><p>Ben nodded. “These real bad witches have my mom. I don’t know how Dean’s gonna stop them. Some old bald guy just took me up here and told me to stay. I think he went back in there.”</p><p>The older kid held up his hand. He was clearly the leader.</p><p>“What do you mean witches, little man? Like Halloween witches? You trippin’?”</p><p>Ben shook his head emphatically.</p><p>“No, I mean <span class="italic">real witches.</span> Like want to bring the dark days upon this whole town, upon this whole world kind of witches. Believe me, there isn’t going to be any candy given out.”</p><p>“Well, I’m up for a little beat down. If that white dude is down there, we’re going to go help him. Tiny get some steel up in here,” the kid said.</p><p>“Sure thing, Tim.” Tiny, who was anything but, popped open the back trunk of a Caddy. Inside was an impressive weapons cache. Ben got up and stepped toward the trunk.</p><p>“Back away, little man. This is our fight now. No freaks are going to take over our homes,” the older kid said.</p><p>They all grabbed street weaponry and disappeared down the ramp and into the parking garage.</p><p>Ben sat on the bumper of the car and said a little prayer that Dean and his mother would reappear soon. This vacation really sucked.</p><p>Samuel and Sam crouched at the cavern entrance; they were taking potshots at any witches trying to leave the cave.</p><p>They heard a noise behind them, and turned to see a group of boys were approaching through the tunnel. Samuel stood up to meet them.</p><p>“Be careful in there boys,” Samuel said.</p><p>“Why aren’t you in there, old man?” the oldest-looking kid asked.</p><p>“Believe me, I’m doing my part,” Samuel said as he pointed his gun at a runaway resurrected hag and pulled the trigger. Her dusty head slit in two and she dropped at the boys’ feet.</p><p>“Good enough,” the kid said.</p><p>Crouched in the shadows, Dean thumbed quickly through the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> He found the spell Thomas had described in the journal that Nathaniel had used to send Belial back to Hell. Dean realized he had one small problem; he didn’t have anyone to sacrifice—except himself.</p><p>He was going to have to rethink this—but fast. Very fast. Constance was hushing the chanting crowd of witches. She had pulled Lisa up on the platform. In the center of the cavern, the earth started to move around in a circle. The fire squelched as a blast of heat poured from the hole opening up in the center of the room. Belial was rising.</p><p>Constance started to chant again. Dean saw a shadowy figure lunge forward in the darkness.</p><p>Then he saw them. The kid who had sold him the guns and his gang ran into the cavern, guns blazing. They started shooting.</p><p>Enraged, Constance released Lisa and leapt off the podium. Dean was relieved to see Lisa still had the presence of mind to seize an opportunity, as she too jumped off the podium and retreated into the corridor, back toward safety.</p><p>Dean ran toward the group.</p><p>“Dude, arm me!” he yelled at Tim.</p><p>Tim swiveled around and threw Dean a sawed-off.</p><p>“Now this is more like it,” Dean muttered. He turned around and started blasting at encroaching witches. He climbed back up onto the Escalade and started shooting at the center of the writhing fiery pit.</p><p>“This is some shit,” Tim called.</p><p>“All in a day’s work,” Dean yelled back.</p><p>The gang members had some great hunting skills. One old witch flew at Tiny, who tried to swat her away but was caught offguard by her strength.</p><p>“Die, witch bitch,” Tiny said, pointing his gun at the resurrected creature’s head and blowing her dusty brains out.</p><p>Another kid with a red do-rag ran into the center of the cavern.</p><p>“Don’t!” Dean yelled. But it was too late, the kid jumped over the ring of fire and landed in the center of the resurrection. The ground gave way and a blast of fire spit up as the kid slid into the pit.</p><p>Tiny steeled himself as another witch jumped on his back.</p><p>“Duck!” Dean yelled.</p><p>Tiny ducked down, leaving an open shot for Dean. He blasted the witch.</p><p>“They’re weakened by all their energy going toward the resurrection,” Dean explained. “Just keep blowing them away.”</p><p>Constance flew at Dean and toppled him off the car, knocking the breath out him. The tall witch knelt on top of him and held the knife to his neck.</p><p>“When are you Campbells going to stop causing problems for me?” she hissed. “I’m getting pretty sick of it.”</p><p>“Get sick of this bitch,” Tim said, shoving his gun into her head. But Constance was too quick; she spun off of Dean and swiped at Tim with the knife. A crimson ribbon of blood appeared across his chest. The boy looked down in surprise, and ineffectually put his hand to his chest. A little bubble of blood spit out his lips.</p><p>“No!” Dean rushed to Tim’s side. “We’ll get you out of here.”</p><p>He shook his head.</p><p>“Too late, man, too late. I ain’t going to make it. Just use me, okay?”</p><p>Dean looked into the kid’s eyes and nodded. He knew what he was saying.</p><p>“Take care of my Gram.” The life was quickly draining out of him.</p><p>At that moment the rumbling became more intense. From the center of the cavern a geyser of fire shot up from the floor, the figure of Belial—half-goat, half-man—appeared from the earth. Though surrounded by fire, the figure was darker than dark. It turned toward Constance in a shower of brimstone.</p><p>“I have raised you, I am your Queen, I am your bind to this earth,” she cried.</p><p>“Belial is yours to obey. You have unchained the first Prince of Hell.” Belial’s voice shuddered over the cavern.</p><p>“Do it. Do it now,” Tim whispered to Dean.</p><p>Dean pulled out the <span class="italic">Necronomicon,</span> and started reading out loud.</p><p>“Oh god of dark and god of light. You are summoned no more. Hide your evilness in the cage from which you came, you are not wanted on this mortal plain. I forbade <span class="italic">vos of atrum pergo huic regnum. Vos es inconcessus ut ingredior inter lux lucis. Vos es inconcessus ut futurus in is terra. Vado tergum qua vos venit. Vado tergum ut vestri cage. Vos es non volo. Per vox of lux lucis quod filiolus of Olympus quod bonus verto tergum ut atrum.”</span></p><p>Belial swung his mighty head and the enormous blackness headed toward Dean, but Dean continued, struggling to keep his voice steady.</p><p>“You are not needed in this world. Go back from which you came. Take this sacrifice and be gone.”</p><p>With that Dean sliced Tim’s throat and the blood spurt from his neck over Dean’s hands. It dripped onto the dirt floor, seeping into the dust. Belial gave a great roar. He moved toward Dean, and as he passed through the ring of fire, he transformed. Suddenly standing in front of Dean was the figure of John Winchester.</p><p>But the figure’s voice wasn’t his father’s; it belonged to something dark and unearthly.</p><p>“Dean, why have you forsaken your father? Why not create Hell on Earth, and then your family can be together again?” it said.</p><p>Dean turned his head away and repeated the last sentence of the incantation.</p><p><span class="italic">“Non opus in hoc mundo. Revertere unde veneris. Accipe sacrificium et recedemus.”</span></p><p>Belial bent down and shot his hand out, grabbing Dean’s chin. He pulled him toward the fire.</p><p>“I haven’t forgotten you, Dean. We’re still waiting for you to come back.”</p><p>With that he let go of Dean and stepped back into the fire and disappeared. The brimstone died down into embers, the earth closed back up and the ground re-coagulated into solid earth.</p><p>Constance screamed in anger. She wielded her knife and sliced off the closest young witch’s head in one motion.</p><p>“You won’t get away with this!” Constance yelled to Dean. She flipped open the book in her hands. “What is this? This isn’t my book. What is this Winchester journal?” She threw the book onto the ground. Dean smiled. He hadn’t taught Ben much, but he had picked up some neat slight of hand.</p><p>Dean felt someone grab his hair and jerk his head back.</p><p>“You made her mad,” Prudence said. “And you’ve really disappointed me, Dean. Why are you always screwing things up for me?” With a powerful swing she threw Dean across the cavern. He hit the rock walls and slid onto the ground.</p><p><span class="italic">I’m getting really tired of being thrown around like this,</span> Dean thought.</p><p>Prudence stepped over the dying fire and marched toward him. Dean shook the cobwebs from his head. He was still holding the <span class="italic">Necronomicon.</span> He flipped to another page and started reading.</p><p>“God of darkness, God of light bring forth the witness this one night. Those that have died at the hands of the undone. Bring them forth for them to shun those that have trespassed against the good and innocent. Bring them forth for the world to once again gain equilibrium.”</p><p>Prudence stopped in her tracks.</p><p>“You wouldn’t.”</p><p>“I just did,” Dean said. “I think some people have a score to settle.”</p><p>Dean pulled a canister of salt out of his jacket and poured a ring around him. Prudence raced forward, but he closed the circle before she could reach him. Dean smiled and pointed behind her. Prudence swung around.</p><p>The witches stood still as the spirits of the long-dead residents of Salem Village appeared. Bridget Bishop, the first to be hanged, approached Prudence.</p><p>“I remember you. You sent me to hang. I was innocent, yet you used your cunning and wit and let me hang.”</p><p>“You slit my throat,” a young voice said. Prudence spun again and came face to face with Abigail Faulkner. “I trusted you. I did everything you said, and how was I repaid? I became your first sacrifice.”</p><p>Prudence shrugged. “Come now, Abby. I was only doing what I was told. It was Constance who picked you to sacrifice.”</p><p>Abigail shook her head.</p><p>“No, it was you.” Abigail shot her hand through Prudence’s chest. Prudence tried to struggle, but her strength had already been drained by the resurrections. “I could have lived a long and happy life. I should have. Well, now we’ll make sure you’re shown the same justice as you showed the innocent people of Salem.”</p><p>Abigail thrust her hand deeper and Prudence’s skin began to lose its healthy pallor. Her eyes grayed over, her skin cracked and flaked. Abigail continued to hold Prudence until her body fell into a thousand dusty pieces at her feet.</p><p>Abigail looked at the walnut-sized shriveled heart in her hand, and she let it drop to the ground. She then looked at Dean and the ring of salt around his feet.</p><p>“I don’t remember you,” she said.</p><p>“I’m just here to observe. It’s your fight now,” Dean replied.</p><p>Abigail nodded, turned and sped toward Constance. The tall, fearsome witch was hissing and spitting as she fought off a dozen angry Salem ghosts all at once.</p><p>“Get off me you fleabags. You were worthless bags of skin in life and now you’re worthless specks of dust. Get off me!” she screamed.</p><p>Bridget Bishop jumped onto Constance’s back. She reached over and thrust her hand into her chest. Constance thrashed and fought, but the angry spirit held on. Other ghosts piled on top of her, until Dean couldn’t even see the witch beneath layers of ghostly flesh.</p><p>Finally, one last scream of agony and anger echoed through the cavern as Constance suddenly aged to her three-hundred-and-fifty years, and crumpled into dirt.</p><p>The cavern was suddenly eerily quiet. With their leader gone, the few witches that remained evaporated.</p><p>The gang members surveyed the scene and then gathered their weapons and limped back toward the tunnel. Dean looked around the echoing space that was littered with bodies. Some of the resurrected witches had merely turned to piles of dusty clothes. Dean shook his head.</p><p>Abigail approached him once again.</p><p>“Are you a Campbell?” she asked.</p><p>Dean nodded. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>Abigail smiled. “Thank you. Thank Thomas and Caleb for me too.”</p><p>Dean nodded, he didn’t want to correct the poor ghost and tell her they were long gone.</p><p>Their work done, Abigail and the other ghosts of Salem disappeared into thin air.</p><p>Dean stepped out of the salt circle. He searched the ground for John’s journal and finding it, tucked it safely back into his jacket. Tim’s body lay prostrate at Dean’s feet. Dean took his Zippo and tore a little piece of cloth from his shirt. He opened the back door of the Escalade, set the burning piece of fabric in the trunk next to the explosives and shut the door.</p><p>He then crouched down and swung Tim’s body onto his shoulder and started jogging up the tunnel. He knew he didn’t have long to get out.</p><p>Thirty seconds later, the percussive explosions started. Dean ran full force with the kid’s six-foot frame bumping against his. He headed through both sets of doors, swinging them closed behind him and then ran out of the parking structure.</p><p>Dean hauled ass up the parking ramp just as the BMW douche from before was pulling in. Dean stood in front of the car.</p><p>“Don’t go in there man,” he yelled.</p><p>“What are you saying to me?” BMW said. “Is that a dead body?” The guy indicated the figure thrown over Dean’s shoulder.</p><p>“I warned you,” Dean said, moving away and walking onto the grass.</p><p>With that a massive explosion ripped through the parking structure. The BMW blew backwards and Dean was thrown to the ground, Tim’s body crumpled beneath him. He stood up as the rest of the gang appeared and surrounded the body. They ceremonially placed a sheet over it.</p><p>“He was a good kid. A hero,” Dean managed to say.</p><p>The kids nodded.</p><p>“Dean!” Ben shouted, running toward him. Lisa followed and they both hugged Dean. “You made it,” Ben said. “I knew you would. The old guy did too.”</p><p>“What old guy?” Dean asked.</p><p>“Your friend. The bald old guy,” Ben said hugging him.</p><p>Dean looked at Lisa who shrugged.</p><p>“That was some nice hand work, Ben,” Dean said, referring to the switch Ben pulled on the <span class="italic">Necronomicon</span> and the journal.</p><p>“Thanks,” Ben said. “But next vacation I think I’m going to stay home.”</p><p>“Me too,” Lisa said with a sad smile.</p><p>“I think I owe you both a real one,” Dean said.</p><p>“Yeah, we’re going to have to talk about that,” Lisa said.</p><p>They started to walk away, then Dean halted.</p><p>“I gotta make one stop first.” He left Ben and Lisa and jogged over across the lawn to the Tim’s grandmother’s house. He rang the doorbell.</p><p>A moment later Tim’s Gram answered the door. She took one look at Dean and seemed to know immediately what had happened.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Dean said. “He was a good kid. There’s some money on his bed.”</p><p>The old lady shook her head.</p><p>“I don’t need no money. I need my grandson alive.”</p><p>“He sacrificed himself for me and my family. He was a real brave kid,” Dean said.</p><p>She nodded, then shut the door on Dean. He walked soberly back to Lisa and Ben and they started to walk down the road. Dean wished once again that he had bought the Impala.</p><h2><span id="chapter-thirty-nine">CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE</span><a href="#chapter-thirty-nine" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Two Weeks Later</p><p>Dean opened his eyes and stared up at the eggshell-colored ceiling. Early morning light filtered through the blinds. The other side of the bed was empty. Lisa must have gotten out of bed without him waking up. Downstairs Lisa had left a note. She was filling in for a yoga class and it was Ben’s first day of school. A slight flutter of guilt filled Dean as he had wanted to be up to say goodbye to Ben, and wish him luck.</p><p>Dean poured himself a cup of lukewarm coffee and sat down on the couch. The house was silent, no kids played outside. He was utterly alone. He had tried to put the events two weeks ago behind him. But no matter how much Dean tried to forget it, he always came back to the realization that he had failed Sam once again. He wasn’t able to resurrect him and the thought of living the rest of his life without him still torn his insides out.</p><p>Dean picked up his phone, he ached for someone, anyone, to call. But who would that be? Bobby would be glad to hear from him, but it wouldn’t be the same. Dean needed his brother back. He sighed. And yet he had made a promise to him. Dean decided to keep it. He pushed himself off the couch, went outside and into the garage. A few seconds later he had the mower out, and was pushing it across the lawn.</p><p>If this was the life Sam wanted him to lead, then he was going to do it. For Sam.</p><p>“Well I can’t say it was a job well done, but you did manage to keep Lucy in his cage, so I guess kudos to you.” Crowley stepped out of the shadows of Samuel’s office.</p><p>Samuel stared up at him, a glass of whiskey in his hand.</p><p>“Dean almost got killed,” Samuel said. “The kid, too.”</p><p>“Ah but he didn’t, old boy. You did your job and now we have to get back to work don’t we? Must keep our eyes on the prize. Your darling Mary.”</p><p>Samuel jumped out of his seat with such force that the chair knocked over and his whiskey glass spun like a top on the table. He was chin to chin with Crowley.</p><p>“Don’t ever say her name again,” Samuel warned.</p><p>“Well since I don’t take to reading the Bible each night, I won’t have much trouble with that. Sit down and get your smelly meat mouth out of my face before I get upset,” Crowley said with an edge.</p><p>Samuel backed off.</p><p>“Now I think you have some monsters to catch.” Crowley flashed a crooked smile.</p><p>“I’m telling you this now,” Samuel said, “as soon as Mary is returned to me, you better watch your Limey ass. Because I’m going to hunt it down and send it back to Hell.”</p><p>“I’ll look forward to that,” Crowley spat. “Very much.”</p><p>And with that the demon disappeared. Samuel picked up his chair and sat back down. There was a knock on the door. Samuel grumbled some sort of acquiesce and Sam entered. He closed the door behind him.</p><p>“Thought you might like to know, there’s a nest of vamps in Oklahoma City. You want to come?” Sam asked.</p><p>Samuel shook his head.</p><p>“You can take care of it without me. You know the drill.”</p><p>Sam nodded. He paused a moment.</p><p>“You okay?” he asked.</p><p>“I’m fine,” Samuel replied, not looking up.</p><p>Sam nodded. “Be back by noon tomorrow.”</p><p>Outside, Sam gave a quick nod to Gwen and Mark, and they headed toward the truck. Sam breathed in the crisp morning air, it felt what he imagined was “good.” He got in the van.</p><p>As they pulled away from the compound, Sam’s mind stayed on the sad look on Samuel’s face. A flicker of sympathy passed over his face, like a quick zap of static from a socket on a dry day. Then as quickly as it came, it was gone.</p><h2><span id="chapter-epilogue">CHAPTER EPILOGUE</span><a href="#chapter-epilogue" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>Fall 1705</p><p>Caleb and I rode into Philadelphia under the cover of darkness. Though only late September, the weather was unusually cold. Fog pushed in from the river and rolled down Market Street making the cobblestones wet and slick. We had been called to town by one Mrs. Webster Moreland. Her letter, hand-delivered to our inn by a servant boy, had asked that we come immediately.</p><p>She had recently arrived in the town of Philadelphia and had left a sizeable estate up the river in the care of her son, Arthur. It seems that she had become rather frightened of her only son; that he was not himself. Once a gregarious, kind-hearted young man, he now seemed sullen and mean, and was seized by frequent violent outbursts. Not knowing if a disease had taken over her son, Mrs Moreland had fled to her city house.</p><p>Caleb believes she is mad, and has made a bet with me to prove it.</p><p>“This will be a waste of our time,” Caleb said, “you’ll see. She will turn out to be a fussy old hen who is making up stories.”</p><p>I told him we would see for ourselves.</p><p>As it turned out Mrs. Moreland was neither fussy nor an old hen. She was a stocky and sane woman who seemed to have her household in order. Her son was her main concern.</p><p>We arrived at seven, just in time for dinner, and she invited us to join her. Caleb and I looked out of place in our leather coats and canvas trousers at her polished dinner table, piled high with roasts and pies. After a meal that rivaled our Christmas feasts, we sat down to speak about her son. After some discussion, it was decided that Caleb and I would ride up to her estate and survey her son’s behavior.</p><p>It seemed however that Arthur had other plans.</p><p>Arthur arrived at his mother’s brick townhouse, unannounced, just after ten. He seemed surprised that she had visitors, namely two gritty gentlemen like Caleb and myself, but he put on his best face to hide his disgust.</p><p>It was decided that we would spend the night. Caleb and I shared a room which contained two of the largest beds we had ever seen. Arthur slept across the hall. Or so we thought. At around two in the morning we heard him sneak out of his room, creep down the stairs, and then we heard the click of the front door latch. Caleb and I jumped into our boots and followed him.</p><p>The fog hadn’t dissipated any as we followed Arthur down the damp streets. At some point he turned a corner into a darkened alleyway. Not having been in the town of Philadelphia before, Caleb and I were unfamiliar with its streets. Perhaps there was another way around, but we didn’t know for sure, and since we risked losing Arthur’s trail, we followed.</p><p>We made our way after Arthur as quietly as we could. The narrow passage stunk of wharf rats from the nearby piers. Behind a brick house we saw Arthur steal into a recessed basement of some sort. When we were sure he was shut inside, we peered into the street-level windows: inside was full of merry men and women, dancing and drinking. Not so unusual, we thought, he’s just a regular young man out for a night of fun.</p><p>But then from behind us came a sound. We hid behind a couple crates of trash and watched a young man in upper-class finery walk to the same door. He looked in our direction and though I’m sure he couldn’t see us we were caught with a most surprising site. His eyes were black—jet black as the night.</p><p>Dearest sister, father once told us of demons, but we have never encountered them ourselves. We are in need of any and all of the Latin exorcism texts, as well as your expertise.</p><p>We are afraid there is a scourge of demons in Philadelphia. Please come quick.</p><p>Your dearest brother,</p><p>Thomas</p><h2><span id="supernatural">SUPERNATURAL</span><a href="#supernatural" class="header-anchor">#</a></h2><p>features exclusive interviews with Jared and Jensen, guest stars, and the behind-the-scenes crew of the show, the latest news, and classic episode spotlights!
